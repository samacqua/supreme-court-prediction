Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue before the Court today is whose citizenship -- citizenship controls for purposes of diversity when a trust is a named party to a lawsuit. We believe, based upon over 200 years of jurisprudence from this Court, the answer is the trustees.
We believe a bright-line rule is appropriate in this case, that in a lawsuit involving a trust, just as with a trustee, the trustee should be the party of interest.

And we should compare it to the -- Why should we get to that question if, when this case began, even if you looked only to the citizenship of the trustees, there was no complete diversity? Your Honor, that -- that is correct. However, we do argue -- and we argued in the Tenth Circuit; it was briefed -- upon whether or not we could dismiss the -- the -- the spoiling nondiverse parties.
That issue was briefed under Evergreen case, and it was briefed before the Tenth Circuit; however, the Tenth Circuit did not address that issue. Respondents bring it up in their brief now; however, our position is that this Court should address the issue that's taken, that it granted cert on, and send that issue back to the Tenth Circuit for review. What the Tenth Circuit held here, the issue that we appealed on, was to look at the beneficiaries as opposed to the trustees.
And we would submit to you that that's just not supportable under common law, and it provides results in an unworkable test that is going to create more confusion than looking at the trustees. At common law, the trustees could sue, couldn't they? They could, Your Honor. And these trustees could not sue, could -- can they? They cannot, Your Honor. Because of a new creature created by Maryland law. That's correct, Justice Scalia.
Maryland law has created a statutory trust, a real estate investment trust. However, our position is that just because that trust can sue and be sued as an entity, that does not change the analysis.
There still has to be somebody we look to, some real people that we look to to determine whose citizenship controls. Well,",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-770, Bank Markazi v. Peterson. Mr. Lamken. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For nearly 200 years, Congress never enacted a statute that purported to limit the effect to one and only one specified case pending before Article III courts disclaiming any reach beyond that solitary monetary dispute. Mr. Lamken, is it one case? I mean, this is a consolidation for purposes of reaching assets -- it's a consolidation of some 19 cases? No, Your Honor, it is not a consolidation of 19 cases.

Would the statute pass? Yes.
So if Congress had identified three unrelated cases and -- and said that for these unrelated cases -- Yes, it specifies them by number and so forth. By number. We believe that the result would be the same.
That Congress crosses the threshold from legislation to adjudication when attempts to pass a law which has no effect and no existence apart from specified cases pending before the Supreme -- I -- I inadvertently interrupted Justice Ginsburg, but in the -- in the 19 cases here, you don't find that principle? No, Your Honor.
There aren't 19 cases here.
There's one case here. There was no -- One case for purposes of executing, but there are -- there are 19 judgments involving thousands. That -- that's correct.
There are 19 underlying judgments, but only one execution. Are there -- are there any in this category, that is, cases litigated to judgment for terrorist acts, that are not in this package of 19 cases? I don't know whether there are any others that -- where they were denied intervention here.
But the point, I think the fundamental point is that no future case that's identically situated, no other case except this one case will be subject to this rule. What if there were 19 cases, Mr. Lamken, and Congress specified them all? Yes.

It is not cut off when the defendant pleads or is found guilty.
The Court has said that the clause guarantees an early and proper disposition of a criminal charge, and that guarantee applies to the guilt stage of a prosecution when most defendants plead guilty and to the sentencing stage, which may be the only place in a criminal prosecution today when a defendant actually mounts a defense. Does the Federal Speedy Trial Act -- not the constitutional provision, but the legislation -- does that cover sentencing, or is that limited to trial?

The Court has said that the clause guarantees an early and proper disposition of a criminal charge, and that guarantee applies to the guilt stage of a prosecution when most defendants plead guilty and to the sentencing stage, which may be the only place in a criminal prosecution today when a defendant actually mounts a defense. Does the Federal Speedy Trial Act -- not the constitutional provision, but the legislation -- does that cover sentencing, or is that limited to trial? Your Honor, my understanding is that it's limited to trial.
The Court has recognized specific interests that are protected by the Speedy Trial Clause, and those interests apply not just to presumptively innocent defendants, as the State and the United States suggests, but some of them apply specifically to guilty defendants. In Barker, for instance, the Court notes that one of the interests that are protected by this -- that is protected by this clause is the interest in rehabilitation, and that a prolonged period of detention in jail can affect a defendant's rehabilitation.
Well, that's specific to a guilty defendant.
And in Smith v. Hooey, the Court noted that even though the defendant had been incarcerated in Federal prison, that that defendant could still be prejudiced by a prolonged delay in the State prosecution that followed because it could affect his ability to seek a concurrent sentence.
That interest also is specific to a guilty defendant. So the sharp line between the guilt stage of a prosecution and the criminal -- and the sentencing stage of a prosecution isn't supported by this Court's speedy trial precedents. What do you do with the -- all of our speedy trial decisions say there's only one remedy, and that is case over.
Dismissal is the only appropriate remedy.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental problem with the statutes at issue in these three cases is that they make it a criminal offense to assert a constitutional right. Under laws of North Dakota and Minnesota, a person who is stopped on suspicion of impaired driving is obligated to take a warrantless chemical test to determine the alcohol content of their blood.

Nevertheless, a person is obligated to take this warrantless -- to submit to this warrantless search, and is committing a criminal offense if he or she does not do so. Is it correct to say that you concede that the State could revoke the driver's license for refusing to take the test, either blood-alcohol or Breathalyzer? That -- that is not at issue in this case.
We haven't taken a position on that, but -- but I -- but we don't dispute for purposes of this case that the State could do that. Well, let's -- let's assume that that is a concession or that we hold that or that that's a premise.
If the State can impose a civil administrative sanction, why couldn't it also impose a criminal sanction? We could have hypotheticals where you would just be no more than three days in jail, criminal sanction, or a three-year suspension, which is obviously greater.
Why should there be a difference? I -- I think the fundamental distinction that -- that governs the outcome of this case, we think, is that -- is that between the State taking away a benefit that it didn't have to give you in the first place, which is what the Court addresses in the unconstitutional conditions line of cases, and this situation here, where the State is saying by fiat, you are subject to a criminal penalty, affirmative criminal penalty, for -- for asserting a constitutional right.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-844, Bruce v. Samuels. Mr. Shelley. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are at least three reasons why the Court should adopt what the courts of appeals have called the per-prisoner approach under PLRA Section 1915(b)(2). One, the per-prisoner approach best comports with the statutory text. Two, the per-prisoner approach is the only one consistent with the careful balance Congress struck between deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits and preserving their right to bring meritorious ones. And three, the per-prisoner approach avoids anomalies and disincentives that Congress could never have intended, disincentives such as discouraging prisoner work by taking one hundred percent of their income month after month.

The key sentence is in -- the key sentence is the second sentence of Subsection (b)(2)
It says the following: ""The agency having custody of the prisoner shall forward payments from the prisoner's account to the clerk of the court"" -- singular -- ""each time the amount in the account exceeds $10 until the filing fees"" -- plural -- ""are paid."" The combination of that singular, clerk of the court, and filing fees, plural, indicates the per-prisoner approach because it means one clerk is to receive payments, even when there are numerous filing fees. Filing fees, the plural, appears in the -- There -- there -- -- in the statute exactly twice. Can't there be more than one filing fee for a single court? No, there cannot, not in the way Congress understood the term in the PLRA.
If you look to (b)(1) and (b)(3), Congress creates it almost as a term of art.
A filing fee includes -- a filing fee, with the word ""filing"" in front of ""fee,"" a filing fee includes all of the subsidiary costs to start up a case. So a court of appeals, for instance, has a $500 docketing fee and a $5 statutory fee, and that's referred to as a -- So what happens if you have -- the district court makes an order, there has to be a filing fee?

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To affirm the Ninth Circuit on the first two questions presented, this Court must accept the following two propositions: First, a plaintiff can force a court to adjudicate the merits of his claim simply by refusing the defendant's offer of capitulation and complete relief. And, second, that a plaintiff has what amounts to a substantive right to class litigation that applies as soon as the complaint is filed and that entitles the case to proceed even if his individual claim drops out before -- Is there any controversy over whether the -- the -- the offer is complete relief?

I don't think so, Your Honor. The district court found that it was at page 40 of the Petition Appendix.
The Ninth Circuit decided this case based on that premise.
That's at page 5a of the Petition Appendix. So I think as the case comes -- Do we take it on that assumption, too? I think you should, Your Honor. Now -- now, they have argued below that the only reason that it wasn't for complete relief was that -- because it didn't provide for attorneys' fees.
But the TCPA, the underlying statute here, does not provide for attorneys' fees. But that's a merits question as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees.
If the question is complete -- you know, ""complete relief"" means what the plaintiff has asked for.
The plaintiff has asked for attorneys' fees here. I don't think that's what ""complete relief"" means, Your Honor.
I think it means that the plaintiff has received everything that he could -- that he could if he received a judgment in this -- in -- Well, he would -- he would receive a finding of liability, which you didn't admit in your offer. He -- I -- He would -- he would be entitled to an injunction against that activity, the activity that caused this particular situation, and if others were shown, to an injunction in other ways.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On the issue we initially asked this Court to resolve in the petition for certiorari, the parties are now in complete agreement.
That issue, of course, was whether a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case is barred from seeking attorneys' fees if it hasn't prevailed on the merits.

It doesn't -- it is certainly not compelled by the statutory language and doesn't serve any rationing statutory policy to take away the power of work fees in a -- in a case of a non-merits disposition. The EEOC, having staunchly defended that rule in its brief in opposition, executed an about-face in its merits brief and now agrees with us that a non-merits disposition can be the basis of a defendant attorneys' fee award under Title VII. Now, for that reason and for all the reasons in our opening merits brief, which the government apparently found convincing, at least, we would suggest that the Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit's ruling and resolve the circuit conflict and rule that prevailing defendants can seek fees as long as they meet the Christiansburg standard, whether or not the disposition was on the merits. If there are no questions about that, the second issue is, what do we do -- Isn't the standard whether the EEOC's actions were frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation? That's the Christiansburg standard, yes, Your Honor. So what difference does it make on what ground it was dismissed? I couldn't agree more. I've been reading these briefs, and with or without prejudice, merits, non-merits, I don't know that even if a judge gets to that point of deciding whether it was on the merits or not, that's not enough.
You always have to decide the bottom line. Right.

Consistent with history, Congress left to the judiciary to determine construction standards, and therefore, in the American Invents Act, there is no explicit statutory language directing the Patent and Trademark Office to use any particular standard of claim construction.

First, in summary, all agree that the broadest-reasonable-interpretation We'll hear argument next in Case 15-446, Cuozzo Speed Technologies v. Lee. Mr. Beeney.

But this Court should reverse, as a matter of statutory construction, for four reasons.
First, in summary, all agree that the broadest-reasonable-interpretation expedient demands a broad ability to amend claims, and that's so because the broadest reasonable interpretation brings into play a broader array of prior art that may be distinguishable if the claims were given their actual interpretation. In establishing inter partes review, Congress sought to substitute and provide a district court-like litigation for the determination of patentability, and therefore, did not provide the wide liberty to amend claims, as Justice -- I might be moved by your argument if Congress had not given any right for the Board to amend, because that would be consistent with practices in the district court, where district court can't amend under any circumstance.
But basically, Congress here said you can amend once.
I'm not sure that that supports your proposition. I think -- Justice Sotomayor, I think there is a distinction between allowing a party to make a motion to amend and the absolute right to amend even once.
And Congress did not provide any right to amend in inter partes review.
It provided only an extremely limited ability to seek to amend.
And, in fact, in practice, that opportunity to seek to amend is almost always denied.
And it is denied consistent with congressional intent of establishing inter partes review to be court -- a court-like adjudication.
So simply as a matter of numbers, the Board has denied 95 percent of the motions to amend.

This case presents the question whether a district court has inherent authority under Article III of the Constitution to recall discharged jurors for further service in the same case, here, for the purpose of deliberating anew and reaching an entirely different verdict.

The answer to that question is no.
The established rule of common law forbade the recall of discharged jurors.
In numerous respects, the Federal Rules of Procedure reflect the understanding that a district court's authority ends at the point of discharge. I thought you had a clear bright-line rule until I got to page 9 of your reply brief, where you say, ""A jury may remain effectively undischarged despite a judge's pronouncement of discharge."" There are cases where you agree that if the judge says you're discharged, they're not really discharged, and the judge can say, oh, come on back. I've got something else you've got to do. Mr. Chief Justice, our rule is clear.
It's a rule that a district court lacks the authority to recall discharged jurors.

And what we offer -- Well, that's pretty lawyerly. (Laughter.) Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. (Laughter.) Saying anytime you're discharged, it's over.
Now, discharge may not be discharge in every case.
Because you recognize that there are cases where the judge says you're discharged but you would allow them to come back. And that is simply, Mr. Chief Justice, because we believe the discharge is an act; it's not just a pronouncement.

It has the authority, but -- but an out-of-State defendant can be moved to Federal court, but it has the adjudicatory authority. Justice Ginsburg, everyone agrees that the Tribes have a form of adjudicatory authority upon consent.

And it seems clear to me that service advisors, as their name suggests, are principally engaged in the servicing of automobiles.

We have never held to the contrary. So we have the States overwhelmingly for half a century using population as shown in the census, and now you're saying they can't do that anymore. I can answer the question in -- in three different ways. First, with respect to the phrase ""equal representation for equal numbers of people."" That sentence originated in Wesberry.

There's a dash, and it continues: ""Therefore, for us to hold that within the States legislatures may draw the lines of congressional districts in such a way as to give some voters a greater voice in choosing a congressman than others would be unconstitutional.""

We have to make a distinction. Can you tell us what the distinction is that marks the end of Federal power and the beginning of local power? So I -- I have several answers to that, Justice Kennedy. First, we completely agree that what -- any action that FERC takes at the wholesale level in some sense is going to affect the retail market.
All things equal, if FERC sets -- FERC will set a higher wholesale rate, there is going to be a higher retail price.
But that can't be a basis, those kinds of effects can't be a basis, for denying FERC's jurisdiction. And the case I would point Your Honor to is the Mississippi Power case.
Now, there was a case in which what FERC did was conclude that a utility could recover at wholesale its investment in a nuclear power plant.
And what the Court held in Mississippi Power was that that had the effect of denying the State regulator the ability to deny that utility recovery of those costs in the retail rates, even though under State law they would have been imprudent costs and not recoverable.

My clients were required, in violation of Regulation B in ECOA as spousal guarantors, to become jointly and severally liable to repay the debts of their husbands' business, which clearly qualifies them as applicants both under the straightforward language of ECOA, as well as the Regulation B that was adopted by the regulators. In this particular instance, as in many credit transactions, the real applicants in this transaction are not a to-be formed limited liability company or corporation, but the persons that will stand as guarantors behind that company. Didn't the Federal Reserve Board originally, I think, in 1977 take the opposite position and said explicitly that applicant excludes guarantors? Your Honor -- Your Honor, with regard to that position that was taken by the FDIC in 1977, they were responding to claims by the industry that they did not want applicants broadly defined to include guarantors for notice provisions.
And in response to that, the regulation was crafted in a way that did, in fact, address that concern, but it was never intended to eliminate the potential claims for spousal guarantors. When the case law came down and said we're relying on the Regulation B of 1977, according to what the regulators adopted then in 1985 they said, we were mistaken.
We've been misinterpreted about what our intent was.
We -- we now need to modify the regulation and make it clear that those persons who were discriminated against based on marital status have the right to bring the claim. Do you have to give notice to -- to guarantors now? No, you do not, Your Honor. Well, how can that be? I mean, they're either applicants or they're not applicants.

FERC says that means that the resource is economic, needed, competitive, and does not suppress prices, any State revenue notwithstanding. The second reason is -- Well, if it doesn't suppress prices, why did Maryland do it? Maryland did it, Your Honor, because they saw a need for generation going forward. As is clear in the generation order, Maryland perceived a problem.
It had large coal units that it believed were going to retire in the coming years, and it needed to have resources in place to be able to meet that need. So it undertook to have those resources built pursuant to the contract mechanism before you. But if that hadn't happened, prices would have been higher.
So it was to suppress prices. No, it was not to suppress prices, and, frankly, Your Honor, could not have suppressed prices. FERC revised the rules in 2011 to be clear that the resource had to bid on the basis of its costs without regard to the State revenue.
So there was no way for it to suppress prices.
If the costs had been too high for the resource, it would never have cleared. It wouldn't have been in the market at all.
It was only in the market because it was able to clear on the basis of its cost, which showed it was efficient. And FERC made that finding.

Now, the State here contends that capital sentencing juries make implicit findings that satisfy the Sixth Amendment under Ring, which the trial judge then simply ratifies.
That is wrong. Whatever the jury's recommendation might imply about the specified aggravating factors, the Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that the jury's verdict is anything other than advisory. Florida law entrusts the factual findings of aggravators to the judge alone, who may do so on the basis of evidence that the jury never heard, and aggravators that the jury was never presented with. Is there ever a case in which the jury found aggravators and recommended the death sentence, and the judge reversed that finding? There may well be.
This is principally a case about the finding of death eligibility, not sentence selection.
I -- Well, I mean, either -- either way, is -- is there -- is there -- Yes. -- is there ever a case in which the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance, but the judge did. Well, we don't ever know what the jury found about any of the specified aggravating circumstances.

Our interpretation is the only one that does so. Consistent with the common-law understanding that Congress codified, ""actual fraud"" is a term of art that includes a recipient's knowing participation in a deliberate fraudulent transfer.

One, it relied upon possible, and one instance not even, violations or errors of State law to find a prejudice that -- that rose to an Eighth Amendment level.
And two, it disregarded altogether, with really no explanation, the long-standing foundational principle that juries are presumed to follow their instructions. The two State law errors, arguably, that -- the Kansas Supreme Court found, one was the admission of evidence of the sister who made the comment about Reginald may have told me he shot those people.

But Congress, in this statute, since the time it was first enacted in 1978, has never sought to create symmetry or parity between the Federal predicates and the State predicates.

One involves a structure; one involves a vehicle.
And those can be easily divided. We look at the charge.
The charge is for a structure, not for a vehicle.
Why -- why is it not divisible? For the exact same reason, Justice Ginsburg, that the California statute at issue in Descamps was not divisible.
In that case as well, the indictment charged that Mr. Descamps had unlawfully and feloniously entered the grocery store.
The prosecutor stated as much, that Mr. Descamps had broken and entered into a grocery store, and Mr. Descamps did not object to that. Nonetheless, this Court, quite properly, held that it was not divisible because California was not required to prove unlawful entry in order to get a conviction. The same is true of Mr. Mathis.
Iowa did not have to prove the type of occupied structure that he supposedly burglarized. But he did one or the other.
In Descamps, there was an element that didn't have to be proved under the State statute.
You didn't have to prove unlawful. The -- the -- California would have had to prove entry, just as Iowa would have to prove an occupied structure.
But California did not have to prove whether the entry was unlawful as would have been required to make the offense a generic burglary offense. Similarly here, Iowa did not need to prove burglary of a building as opposed to burglary of a land, air, or water vehicle or similar place.

Maryland has a bribery statute that might apply in a situation like this.
And Congress has passed a bribery statute targeted to bribery of State and local officials, 18 U.S.C. 666, that may or may not apply to the repair shop owners.

Your Honor -- It seems to me -- what that means to me under color of law is you -- you pretend to have a legal right to it, which in fact you don't have. Justice Scalia, until 1992, I think that was an open question, but this Court decided in Evans v. United States in '92 that Hobbs Act extortion encompasses the paying of -- of bribes. I dissented, I assume. (Laughter.) You did.

But that's just another way of saying that Puerto Rico's outside the scope of Chapter 9.
A State's only role in the Chapter 9 regime is to authorize its municipalities to be debtors. Indeed, Chapter 9 can't apply to Puerto Rico in light of the 1984 amendment.
That amendment categorically precludes Puerto Rico from passing through the gateway into Chapter 9, which is located in Chapter 1 in Section 109(c)(2). Mr. Landau, that's true. Don't you run up against, with respect to the Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico's legislation, the Contract Clause, the -- the bar against impairing contracts; that Puerto Rico can't impair the lenders' contracts? So apart from -- so if there's -- if we're dealing only with the Puerto Rico legislation, doesn't that, in -- in requiring nonconsenting lenders to give up or have their claims reduced, Puerto Rico is violating the Contract Clause? Your Honor, the Respondents here have certainly brought Contract Clause claims.
And if this Court decides the preemption issue in our favor, then they would certainly be allowed to litigate those contract claims issues on appeal -- excuse me -- on remand. The -- this Court has never addressed the question whether the Contract Clause applies to Puerto Rico, which, as this Court is aware, is in a somewhat unique position in our Federal structure.

Your question, Your Honor, raises a very intricate question with -- with -- In -- in the statute is -- it works both ways. In the statute, Your Honor, it does because there's no question Puerto Rico is in a unique status that is different than Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa precisely because those are all territories governed, as traditionally, by organic acts of Congress. But is there -- is there -- What -- what about the Northern Marianas? Your Honor, they are in an interesting position that is generally more analogous to Puerto Rico in the sense that they are a Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas with a compact of their own that was very much modeled on Puerto Rico, although it's somewhat different than the Puerto Rico model.
But there's a profound distinction that goes to the heart of this case between the home rule territories, where Congress, to be sure, has delegated a measure of self-government to those particular territories, but each of them, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa are still governed by organic acts of Congress, as was Puerto Rico prior to 1952.

Injury is the focus of Section 1964(c), and therefore, injury is limited to domestic application absent a clear indication to the contrary. That is a straightforward application of this Court's decision in Morrison, which says you identify the focus of the provision before you, and you limit it to domestic application unless Congress says otherwise. So you're making a distinction between RICO when the government is using it as a prosecutorial tool -- tool, and RICO -- Yes.
Yes.
We are making a distinction between Section 1962, which is the underlying criminal prohibition, and Section 1964(c), which is the private civil right of action.
Different provisions and statutes can have different foci, as Morrison itself made clear in separately analyzing Section 30 and Section 10(b) of the '34 Securities Act. And -- and here the difference between the substantive prohibition and the private right of action is clear from this Court's private right of action jurisprudence over the last 30 or 40 years which made clear that the decision to prohibit certain underlying conduct is fundamentally different from the decision to provide a private right of action for violation of substantive law. That's why Section 1964(c) has a different focus.

Now, at the time that Congress enacted that long-standing practice in the 1976 amendments to the Act, this Court's precedents had made clear that one basis upon which three judges are, quote, ""not required"" is when the claim is constitutionally insubstantial.

The office necessarily must rely on special counsel to be the frontline lawyers to collect these debts, yet the Sixth Circuit in this case held both that special counsel are not attorney general officers and may not use attorney general letterhead without risking liability under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

And so they fall within the government exemption designed to protect government operations.

Hawkes Company. Mr. Stewart. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A jurisdictional determination issued by the Army Corps of Engineers is not final agency action because it does not order any person to do or refrain from doing anything and does not alter anyone's legal rights and obligations.
The jurisdictional determination, or JD, expresses the Corps' opinion about whether a particular tract contains waters protected by the Clean Water Act.
That stated opinion may affect the recipient's assessment of the options available to it, but it does not affect the actual legal status of those options. This Court's precedents made clear that the practical effects on which Respondents rely are not a sufficient ground for treating an agency communication as final agency action. Now, the Respondents primarily emphasize the practical impact that the Corps' jurisdictional determination would have upon themselves, the recipients and the intended audience.
And they say the jurisdictional determination indicating that the Corps believes there are waters of the United States on the Property will force them to choose among three unattractive options: One, would be seeking a permit which could be an expensive process and wouldn't be by any means certain to succeed; the second would be discharging pollutants, discharging fill onto the Property and taking their chances in a future enforcement action; and the third would be playing it safe, forgoing development entirely. And the problem with Respondents' argument is that that choice would have existed before the jurisdictional determination was issued.
It would have existed if the Corps had never adopted its practice of issuing jurisdictional determinations upon request. It's simply a choice that is posed by the Clean Water Act. If there were a provision of law saying that a jurisdictional determination by the Corps or by the EPA is binding on the federal government in future litigation, would that be reviewable? I think if the -- if the statute said that, we would have a very different case, because in that case we would have something much closer to Bennett v. Spear. In Bennett v.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted Section 117 in response to the epidemic of domestic violence in Indian Country. The Ninth Circuit was wrong to strike down the statute as applied to offenders like Respondent who have abused and battered their intimate partners again and again, but whose tribal-court misdemeanor convictions were uncounseled and resulted in a sentence of imprisonment. The Ninth Circuit's constitutional analysis disconnects the validity of the underlying prior conviction from the permissibility of relying on those convictions to prove the defendant's recidivist status if he commits additional criminal conduct.

The Ninth Circuit's constitutional analysis disconnects the validity of the underlying prior conviction from the permissibility of relying on those convictions to prove the defendant's recidivist status if he commits additional criminal conduct.
And that runs counter to this Court's precedence. In Nichols v. United States, this Court held that a conviction that was uncounseled but was valid at the time it was obtained remains valid when it's used in a subsequent prosecution to classify the defendant as a recidivist.
As I understand the Court's logic in that opinion, the rationale was that in the absence of an actual Sixth Amendment violation in the underlying proceeding, there's no proceeding in which the defendant had but was denied a right to counsel. He didn't -- he has a right to counsel in the subsequent Federal prosecution, and here, Respondent had that right and it was respected.
He was -- he was represented by appointed counsel at every critical stage.
But when a defendant doesn't have a right to counsel in the prior proceedings that resulted in that conviction, then there's no defect, no constitutional defect in those underlying convictions that can possibly be carried over or exacerbated through reliance on those convictions in the subsequent proceeding. Now, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, and Respondent's arguing here, that that might apply when the conviction is -- is valid under the Court's rationale in Scott.
There, of course, the Court held that there's no right to appointed counsel in a proceeding that doesn't result in imprisonment.

One individual was fined $1,000 and the claimant director was given two years of supervision.

That is not what ""fraud"" means. Now, coming back to the four words that matter, ""false or fraudulent claim."" ""False"" means false.
This Court construed that word in Williams v. United States.
Footnote 3 of Respondents' brief unsuccessfully tries to distinguish Williams.
The Solicitor General ignores Williams. It can't mean misleading, then? So ""false"" can only mean false? It can't mean deceptive, misleading? It cannot, Justice Ginsburg. Because the body of law that covers deceptive and misleading statements is not falsity.

Why -- if -- if both acts qualify equally, why shouldn't the same state of mind attach to each? The same state of mind should attach to each, and that is why intentionality is the state of mind that under the common law can attach to each.
Because intentional battery covered both the offensive physical contact as well as the physical injury, whereas recklessness covers only bodily injury. I'm sorry. Intentionality, in my mind, is misperceived, because you think -- you're talking about intentionality as the act of causing the injury.
But I understood common-law battery to be the intentional act that causes the injury; i.e., if a husband threw a bottle at a wife, doesn't intend to hit her, but the bottle smashes against the wall and the glass embeds itself in her face, under the common law that would have been a battery because the act, the intentional act, was to throw the bottle.

And C(i) is -- is reprinted on -- on pages 11A. So again, we're looking at paragraph -- subparagraph C(i) of paragraph (33), which everyone in this case agrees expands the original church plan definition in subparagraph A. Now, the only plausible reason that C(i) repeats the entire phrase ""a plan established and maintained by a church"" is Congress intended that C(i) redefine and modify that entire phrase. Why? There was a provision that was proposed that would have done very clearly what you think this provision does now.
And Congress didn't pass it.
So an earlier version did exactly what you wanted.
It said you can -- a plan that establishes and/or maintained by a church. It -- it said established and -- and maintained.
And the problem, Justice Sotomayor, is that it -- the -- the assumption is incorrect that that provision did everything that folks wanted.
It actually didn't.
It -- it excluded the very plans that everyone concedes was intended to be -- The pension plans. -- covered. Well, plans established by churches and maintained by somebody else.

So if you took the allegations in this complaint and -- and when -- we made them out to be the banks were engaged in some sort of discriminatory loans, and the City had to -- had to basically expend funds to test that out to enforce its housing statutes, that looks very much like the one-to-one relationship that was at issue in Havens, both for zone of interest and for proximate cause.

As such, Petitioner is entitled to a resentencing without the career offender enhancement.

I agree that there is nothing imprecise about possession of a sawed-off shotgun.
Where the constitutional concerns come into play with the commentary is actually at the point where the Commission was interpreting the residual clause in order to identify the possession of a shotgun offense as falling within the residual clause.

There was no dispute that they agreed to go to a boxing match together.

But Mr. Buck was, unquestionable -- But more likely than not that he wouldn't. Yes.
He was on the low end of the spectrum in terms of the risk of violence. But here this expert's evidence not only prejudiced Mr. Buck at sentencing, it also put the very integrity of the courts in jeopardy.
For that reason, Texas acknowledged that its ordinary interest and finality does not apply.
It publicly declared that it would waive its procedural defenses and allow new sentencing hearings in six capital cases, including Mr. Buck's, that involved the same expert's race as criminal violence opinion.

Number two, if there's any ambiguity on this point, OPM's notice-and-comment regulation answers a question in favor of preemption. And number three, although the majority of the Supreme Court of Missouri thought otherwise, we believe there's no constitutional infirmity in Section 8902(m)(1) under the Supremacy Clause. If I could turn to my first point, it seems to us that the antisubrogation rule in this case is preempted for basically the same reasons this Court considered in FMC in concluding that the same rule was preempted under ERISA.
That is to say that it effectively requires plan administrators to calculate benefits on the basis of different liability conditions that vary from State to State; that very importantly, it undermines the statute's goal of uniformity; and third, that it could encourage plan sponsors, in this case, the Federal government, to reduce the scope of coverage. In addition to those reasons, this statute gives you an additional reason to find that it is preempted, and that is that it also preempts those rules that relate to payments with respect to benefits. It is quite clear to us that the subrogation and reimbursement claims that are at issue in these rules quite plainly refer to and relate to payments with respect to benefits; and therefore, the Supreme Court of Missouri was wrong in overlooking that part of the statute and also wrong in overlooking your decision in FMC v.

What we do intend, as we describe in that footnote, is to give more detail as to how the standard works. I'd say -- The standard -- the standard you're asking us to adopt, substantially equal opportunity, that does appear someplace.
It appears in Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in Rowley, and the court itself did not adopt that formulation, did not adopt substantially equal opportunity.
So you're asking us to adopt a standard that the majority already had before it and didn't adopt. Justice Ginsburg, yes, Justice Blackmun proposed a standard similar to the one that we offered the Court today, but that was 1982.

And if so, did you just say it? Justice Kagan, what we think is that if you want to give a definition for sexual abuse of a minor, at least in the context of the allegation of abuse being due to age, that 16 would be the appropriate cutoff.

Petitioner obtained nothing, yet the government seeks to hold him jointly and severally liable for the entire amount.

But those background principles are both inconsistent with the text of Section 853 and also do not apply on their own terms. So to begin with our textual argument, I'd like to focus on the structure of Section 853(a) because Section 853(a) enumerates three categories of property subject to criminal forfeiture.
853(a)(1), at issue here, are proceeds obtained by the illegal activity; 853(a)(2) addresses the instrumentalities of crime; and 853(a)(3) addresses the criminal's interest in a criminal enterprise. So we pointed out in our opening brief that really joint-and-several liability doesn't make a lot of sense as to 853(a)(2) and (a)(3), which supports the inference that it also doesn't apply to (a)(1)
And the government's brief states, somewhat surprisingly in my view, that, in fact, joint-and-several liability for co-conspirators applies only as to (a)(1) and does not apply as to (a)(2) and (a)(3)
But that position by the government really has no textual basis at all so far as we can discern. But doesn't it seem that there's some back and forth about what's new and what's old in the government's theory, is that part of what's changed in the government's theory or not? Yeah.
That is one thing that's changed.
We quote a Third Circuit case from, I think, two years ago where the government took the exact opposite position and, in fact, persuaded the Third Circuit to apply joint-and-several liability under (a)(2), which is one of the reasons we put this argument in our brief. But the government's change in position, I just cannot reconcile it with the statute at all.
I mean, the government's theory is that (a)(2) and (a)(3) are somehow tied to ownership whereas (a)(1) is not, but you cannot get that",1.0

And I think that can be seen from the fact that if the State's court's order had simply just said, henceforth, Petitioner's waived retirement pay is now divided, if that's -- those were the words of the modification order, there would have been no difference at all in effect than what actually occurred in the modification.
So -- Suppose that what the court had said is, taking a look at what the retirement pay is now, how much it is total, and had specified then a dollar amount for the wife equivalent to what the half was before the disability benefits, that would be okay; and if it takes disability later, she still keeps the amount that was awarded, the dollar amount. So, I'm sorry.
If the question was if the -- if the modification order had simply said you have to pay a dollar amount equal to the amount that you've waived, if that was the modification order, we can assume the same preemption concern that exists because that's the economic equivalent of a division of the -- No.
I -- I think Justice Ginsburg's question is, the original divorce decree here said Petitioner's entitled to and is awarded as her sole and separate property 50 percent of Respondent's military retirement.
If it had read Petitioner's entitled to $250 a month, period, full stop, to ensure that that is received by her, she'll get $250 a",1.0
"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 15-1189, Impression Products v. Lexmark International. Mr. Pincus. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case brings before the Court two questions regarding the patent exhaustion doctrine, also known as the first sale doctrine.
As this Court said in Bowman, under that doctrine, the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.
And by exhausting the patentee's monopoly on that item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing as he sees fit. That principle goes back, of course, to the 15th century.

The common law refused to enforce restraints on alienations of chattels based on the fundamental insight that you own the goods that you buy, and you should be able to do with them what you wish, and that clouds over Title -- hurt the marketability of goods and intercommerce, and importantly, in the patent context, allowing these downstream restrictions to be forced would preempt secondary markets with -- which check the patent owner's monopoly power. Let me begin with the first question, which is whether the authorized sale of an article embodying the patent exhausts patent rights with respect to that article, or whether the patentee may impose restrictions enforceable under patent laws, such as on resale, repair or reuse simply by stating such a restriction in the sales agreement. The courts -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but that limitation is critical, right? Enforceable under patent law? Enforceable under patent law. We -- there's no question here.
The contract law, with its limitations, would allow the enforcement of -- of those restrictions if they were a valid contract.
This is all about whether the patent law remedies apply. The courts' description and application of the doctrine for more than 150 years makes clear that such restrictions cannot be enforced under the patent law.
A -- Are there other examples of really important rules that have not been codified? Why hasn't this been codified? In the Patent Act, Your Honor? Too busy or what?

The question in this case is whether the Federal Arbitration Act precludes Kentucky from erecting the special obstacle to enforce arbitration agreements signed by an attorney-in-fact.
To ask that question, we believe, is to answer it.
That's the very reason that Congress enacted the FAA, to prevent discriminatory rules targeting arbitration agreements.

That's -- that's not this statute, I know. But at -- at some point, can arbitration clauses be included in a -- in a list of items that must be given special attention? At some point they can, Your Honor.
And I think the dividing line -- the statute, of course, refers to rules that apply to any contract. This Court has talked about contracts generally.
We don't think that -- that means that the rule has to apply to every single contract no matter what. If the rule takes its meaning from a characteristic other than arbitration, to give an example, if a -- if a State had a law that said all consumer contracts have to be in at least 10-point type, surely the court -- the State could apply that law to an arbitration agreement associated with a consumer contract. The problem, obviously, arises if there's some gerrymandering that puts arbitration in a special category.
And -- and we think the rule here fails for several reasons, one of which is even the categories that the State court said it was erecting really don't hold up based on the objective evidence.
But also more importantly, the reason that arbitration was included in this category is the very reason that the FAA forbids, which is the conclusion by the State",1.0

Your Honor, I -- actually, the government doesn't really take that position because it contends that laches does not apply to the government at all.
So the government's supposed equitable restriction -- or at least the government has taken that position in every court, and certainly does not contradict that position in its brief. So the government's view is that there's some kind of equitable limitation that only applies at the remedial stage after the trial and the remedial stage is already over.
So the person's already stood trial after, you know, 10, 20, 30 years after the incident.
And even then, it's a pretty weak equitable restriction. I think the recent Wiley case kind of illustrates this restriction in action where the government sought 22 years of prejudgment interest at a very high interest rate.
And the government -- and -- excuse me -- the district court said that because the SEC was partially responsible for the delay, it was going to apply a somewhat lower prejudgment interest rate that lowered the amount of prejudgment interest from 200 to $100 million, and that is not really an adequate substitute for a statute of limitations in our view. So we think that a statute of limitations is necessary for actions to be dismissed pretrial.
And we think that also our position falls within the heartland of the word ""forfeiture."" We ask the Court to apply the ordinary definition of forfeiture, which has not changed between the 19th century and today.

In advocating the contrary rule, respondent takes the position that plaintiffs who have had no connection to an Indian tribe whatsoever who were injured as a result of a tribal employee's negligence in carrying on a commercial activity miles away from a reservation should have no remedy except whatever the tribe chooses to provide in tribal court.
That position represents an extraordinary and unwarranted expansion of tribal immunity. They say it's the same as if it were federal employee, then you would have the Westfall Act.
If it was a state employee, you would have the same regime, and the tribe says, ""And we do the same thing."" You can sue in our court just as you could sue in federal court under the Westfall Act -- Connecticut court under the Connecticut Act, and you can sue in our court. Well, and when a claim arises, you know, within the reservation that is subject to the tribe's legislative and adjudicatory jurisdiction, then the tribe has the authority to define how that claim shall be handled. But here, we're talking about a claim that arose under Connecticut law from an accident on a Connecticut highway not on the reservation, and the tribe does not have the authority to define the process for handling that claim.
That's subject to Connecticut law. So the -- the analogy, I think, that they're trying to draw is if you had an employee of one state who, you know, was involved in an accident in a different state -- and there are a lot of reasons that situation isn't really analogous, but even taking it on its own terms, the forum state has jurisdiction over that case.

With -- Life Tech has -- Life Technologies operates an -- an enormous plant in England, in the United Kingdom.

Four out of the five components that go into the creation of the kits that are at issue in this case are sourced outside of the United States; one inside.

And as relevant to this litigation, all of the kit -- kits are sold outside of the United States. So the only contact that any of this has with the United States is the fact that a single, commodity product is shipped to England as part of the process for the fabrication of these particular kits. Now, that commodity product is called a Taq polymerase, which I will readily concede that when I think about what you buy off-the-shelf, I don't go to Costco to buy Taq polymerase, but I'm told, and I think it's absolutely undisputed in the record, that this is a commodity.
This is at the essence of what the Congress enacted in (f)(2), which is a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for many non-infringing uses.

The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to say that you don't get to go to any Federal court or any State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, State or Federal, that must be a ""court of competent jurisdiction."" And the only way to find out whether a court is a ""court of competent jurisdiction"" is to examine the statutes creating that court and granting it jurisdiction. Does that include -- you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but ""is this court competent to hear this controversy"" would include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?

In Dolan the Court struggled with the mechanics.
How was the Court going to evaluate the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act? What does it require a district court to do? And after struggling through those mechanics, the Court said that essentially the second document fills in an amount-related blank in the original judgment that made clear that restitution was applicable. It is clear that what happens second, the restitution part, is nothing more than a completion of the original judgment and sentence.
It is not a new judgment.
It is not a new sentence.
It is simply a completion, a fill-in-the-blanks as the Court has phrased it. We know not only from Dolan that this should be the case, but we know it also by looking at the criminal appellate rules as they relate to criminal cases.
If we go down one by one each of the sections of 4(b), each section leads to a single conclusion.
Only one notice of appeal is required. What about 3(c), which requires the notice of appeal to designate the judgment order or part thereof being appealed? So a notice of appeal can't designate an order that has not yet been made. That's correct, yet it's not entirely correct.

Second, the tradition of deferential appellate review is robust, not only for administrative subpoenas, but also for close analogs, such as search warrants and grand jury subpoenas. Third, the district court is the judicial actor best positioned to decide the issue for any number of reasons that this Court articulated in Pierce and is applied in subsequent cases.

And this Court in Highmark talked about the district court living with a case. In -- in our case, the district court had experience, not only with the parties in the context of the subpoena at issue, but also with a parallel proceeding that the agency brought under the ADEA, and had experience in that.

If that is exactly what Respondent and the government are asking this Court to do, under the guise of interpreting the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
There is nothing -- Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, suppose there were a suit brought in court to collect on a debt that is time-barred.
Would that violate the Fair Credit law if you sued in court on a debt that was time-barred? Justice Ginsburg, our view, perhaps not surprisingly, is no.
Our view is that there would be nothing misleading or unfair about the suit in that instance. But this Court need not address that issue in order to resolve the question presented here, and indeed, the courts of appeals that have accepted our view have largely assumed that the filing of a suit in state court presents different considerations from the filing of a proof of claim in bankruptcy.
And that is for the simple reason that there are distinctive characteristics about the operation of the bankruptcy system. First, and perhaps most importantly, the bankruptcy system defines the term ""claim"" quite broadly to include any circumstance in which there is a right to payment.
And as this Court held in Butner, whether or not there is a right to payment is defined under state law, and Alabama law is clear that the running of a limitations period does not extinguish the right; the right remains.

Each lot singly would be worth a hundred thousand, but these lots where you can build a bigger home are worth $500,000. The county wants a fire -- fire station and it takes Lot E.
What do they pay for it under your theory? They should pay for -- compensation for the taking of Lot E.
Any taking -- Which is $100,000.
So under your hypothetical, property owners stand to lose $300,000 under my hypothetical and your answer. No, I don't think so.
Under the hypothetical -- The hypothetical is together, they are worth 500,000; singly, they're worth a hundred thousand each. What is the amount that the -- the county has to pay to take Lot E for the fire station? The analysis must begin with defining the relevant parcel that's the subject of the case analysis.

General Gershengorn, can I ask: As you read this statute, suppose you just took out these words ""notwithstanding Section"" -- ""Subsection (a)(1)."" What would then the effect of the statute be? So, Your Honor, I think that our textual argument would be much more difficult, and the effect of the statute would be effectively to override (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). The ""notwithstanding"" clause really is the anchor of our textual interpretation.
But its strength, I think, comes not only from its text, but also how it fits so well with both the history, structure, contemporaneous interpretation, and practice. But just focusing on text for a minute. Sure. If that's true, if the entire textual argument really does rest on the ""notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)"" -- I mean, typically when you have a ""notwithstanding"" clause, it means, you know, take away Subsection (a)(1), not, you know, close your eyes to Subsection (a)(1)

Section 289 does not require that result, and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does not require that result.
We respectfully ask that the Court hold that when a design patent claims a design that is applied to a component of a phone or a component of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, when a design patent is applied to an article of manufacture within a multi-article product, we request that you hold that Section 289 entitles the patent-holder to total profit on the article of manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and not the profits on the total product. The problem is, is how to instruct the jury on that point.

In doing so, Congress has always required that the persons involved have a demonstrated and sufficient connection to the United States, either in themselves or through their parents, to warrant the conferral of citizenship, because citizenship carries with it attendant duties and rights on the part of the individual, and important duties of protection and obligation on the part of the United States government. This case concerns the framework under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as originally enacted for granting citizenship to persons outside the United States as of the date of their birth. Other provisions deal with the granting of citizenship later in life.
Those were open to Respondent or his father in this case, but were not taken advantage of. In particular, this case concerns the granting of citizenship to children born out of wedlock abroad, a situation in which this Court's -- this Court's cases made clear that mothers and fathers are not typically similarly situated with respect to their legal status concerning the child at the moment of birth. The general rules for citizenship at birth are set out in 8 U.S.C. 1401.
And I'm referring to the Act as originally enacted; it was revised in 1986.
If both parents were U.S. citizens, then a child born outside the United States would be a citizen of the United States as long as one of the parents had resided in the United States for any period of time.
Congress did not deem that to be a sufficient connection to the United States, given that both parents are citizens. On the other hand, if one parent was a U.S. citizen and one parent was an alien, Congress had a markedly different approach.

Intent to wrong a bank's property rights, which includes its own possessory rights, in bank-held property means intent to cause the bank, not the customer, to bear the proper loss of a fraud scheme.
And in this sense -- I'm sorry.
Possessory right means I own something.
I'm holding it.
In most criminal charges for larceny, the issue is whether I have a possessory right, regardless of what I want to do with this property, over you who's taken it from me.
So where do you get the next step that possessory right means I have to lose something of value or that I'm going to ultimately bear the loss? Isn't the loss merely the loss of the possessory right? Your Honor, the statute turns on intent, and were the government to prove the defendant's intent to deprive of you of your possessory right, and that would be sufficient.

And on that military uniform, they design the best desert camouflage that's been ever designed in the history of the world. And they submit it to the copyright office, and they don't claim the design in the uniform, they only claim copyright in the design on the uniform. There is no question they would have the copyright in the design, but the courts would still look to see whether that adds to the utilitarian aspects of that uniform such that that design copyright holder could not prevent the military from producing a military uniform that uses that design.

I'd like to open first with some undeniable points.
In Fourco Glass, this Court made two holdings about 1400(b) that control this case.
The first is this Court interpreted Section 1400(b) as a standalone.
It's the sole and exclusive provision governing venue in patent cases and is not to be supplemented with Section 1391. How can that be when in Brunette we said that 1391 governed aliens, the definition of aliens? So that broad statement we couldn't have meant. What the Court held in Brunette was that venue legislation had, since the beginning of the Republic, been extended only to United States domestic persons and that the then-existing 1391(d) of Title 28 was not a venue rule at all, but rather was a codification of a principle that dated back to 1789 that aliens were simply outside the scope of all venued laws. So what do we do with unincorporated associations? What we do with unincorporated -- Those are -- those are not defined by 1400. Well, 1400(b) in Fourco was held to apply to all defendants.
That was one ground on which this Court held in Fourco that 1400(b) was standalone, precisely because its predecessor had applied to any person, corporation, or partnership.
And there was never any practical issue interpreting 1400(b) as in litigation involving limited partnerships and even unincorporated nonperson associations, because the linchpin of 1400(b) and its predecessor was domicile.

But standing is not dispensed in gross and those indications of judicial power must be grounded in Article III, and that is particularly so because of two key facts. First, Rule 24(a)(2) situates intervenors who are in a different position from regular plaintiffs.

But standing is not dispensed in gross and those indications of judicial power must be grounded in Article III, and that is particularly so because of two key facts. First, Rule 24(a)(2) situates intervenors who are in a different position from regular plaintiffs.
Insofar as intervenors only must show that the existing parties don't adequately represent their interests, so it is absolutely foreseeable that an intervenor will adopt a different position than the parties in the case and invoke Federal judicial power. And, second, like here, when the party challenges the standing of an intervenor in district court, that court does not abuse its discretion when it conducts the standing inquiry.
This rule is efficient, it avoids all sorts of contingent derivative interests -- It sets up a difference between intervening on the defendant's side and the plaintiff's side.
Intervening on the defendant's side under your scheme, that's easy, but not on the plaintiff's side.
And why should there be that disuniformity? Yeah, I don't know that there is any sort of disuniformity.
The first thing I'd say is, Justice Ginsburg, is this case involves a plaintiff intervenor and some of the defendant intervenor's standards and stuff does get a little meta, and I don't know that you have to reach it here. But if you were to reach it and you were to ask, I'd say that the inquiry would be essentially the same.
This Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry basically gave us the test for what that is, and it said in Hollingsworth, ordinarily we think of standing as something about plaintiffs, but it's also true about defendants too.

Number one, that the policy in this case is not facially neutral, and number two, that based on their religious character, churches are not eligible for the benefit here. This admitted discrimination against religion violates this Court's Free Exercise Principles. First, as stated in McDaniel and Smith, the Free Exercise Clause prevents the government from imposing special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status, and forcing a choice between the exercise of religion and receiving either a government benefit, right, or privilege. Assuming that there's no serious risk of an establishment violation, that's off the table, are there ever instances in which status -- religious status can be used to deny religions or religious believers benefits from the State? Or are you saying that it's -- that absent in Establishment Clause problem, that status can never be the base -- religious status can never be the basis for a governmental action or governmental ordinance, governmental statute? I -- I'm not sure if it can be.
I can't think of a specific example.
And the reason I say that is, the question is, is why would someone's religious status matter in the first place to receiving a government benefit? And that's another -- On that -- on that question, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson case back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms what the Framers didn't want was tax money imposed to pay for building or maintaining churches or church property.
And doesn't that fit this case? And if so, is Everson passé? I don't think it does. Everson also said that we have to be careful in not establishing a church not to deprive religious people or organizations of general government benefits.

Subject matter jurisdiction bespeaks the court's power to decide a case, and before a court in the United States may exercise that power over a foreign sovereign, it needs to decide that that sovereign is not entitled to immunity.

""Decide"" comes from Section 1602 of Title 28.
That phrase ""not entitled to immunity comes from Section 1330.
What that means in practice is what this Court has explained in Verlinden, which is that a court presented with a Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act claim against a sovereign must decide at this threshold of the litigation, must satisfy itself that jurisdiction exists. I take it there will be instances, or there could be instances in which the court finds that there is jurisdiction, that there is no immunity, and then as the case develops in the fact finding stages that, you know, I've made a mistake; there's immunity here.
That could happen. It could conceivably happen, Your Honor.
It generally does not happen for a couple reasons.
The first is that immunity is -- unless it is pressed by the sovereign at the beginning, it's considered to be waived.
So in circumstances where a sovereign, for example, doesn't raise a factual challenge -- In my -- my hypothetical, it is raised; the judge rules against it, and especially in a case like this where there's, I think, a foreign subsidiary that's incorporated in domestic -- domestically in Venezuela, then there might be questions of the extent of overlapping management and so forth. It seems to me that that might -- if there's an initial finding of no immunity, the judge might, in the course of hearing the case on the merits that, you know, really there's immunity here.
That's -- that's possible. It's certainly possible.

Our position is that such mail service is allowed, and it's a three-part argument. First, purely textual evidence of meaning shows that this reading of the treaty is at least reasonable.

We do not agree the text is wholly unambiguous.
We believe the text begins as very ambiguous.
Looking at Article 10(a), (b), and (c), where (a) uses the word ""send,"" (b) and (c) use the word ""effect service.""

There were two other French terms of art for ""service,"" and the convention used ""nova casiam"" and ""signif casiam"" as terms for service.

There are distinctions to be made in -- in the context of the public-trial right, for example.
Those distinctions play out as -- at the threshold question whether the public-trial right, in fact, has been violated. But certainly what this Court suggested in Waller where the courtroom closure was for a -- a suppression hearing at the outset of the trial and not the entire trial, that when the public-trial right is deemed to have been violated, it is itself structural.

Bivens' liability does not attach here for at least three reasons. First, the Bivens remedy should not be extended to national security and immigration policy decisions by senior officials in the wake of the September 11 attacks.
If the damages remedy is to be imposed, it's for Congress, not this Court, to do so. Second, the list merger theory suffers from the same pleading deficiencies that this Court identified in Iqbal itself.
Among other things, there is an obvious alternative and noninvidious explanation of the list merger decision.
Given the uncertainty about the status of detainees on the New York list, the list merger was undertaken to avoid the inadvertent or premature release of a dangerous terrorist. And third, the defendants here violated no clearly established right.
It would not have been clear to every reasonable defendant that merging the lists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks would be unconstitutional rather than risking premature release of a detainee on the New York list. I think the easiest way for this Court to resolve this case is through the Iqbal pleading theory. But given this Court's admonition that the existence of the Bivens remedy is an antecedent question that the Court should address first, let me start there.

It also found that the Ministry's interpretation appeared to be at odds with the regulations that it cited and the documentary evidence before the court. The Second Circuit held that the district court abused its discretion by failing to dismiss the case at the motion to dismiss stage.

Mr. Heytens -- Your -- your first statement, I -- was very well stated.
The first reason is because the only thing that double jeopardy -- that the clause applies to is? That the Self-Incrimination Clause can only be violated during a proceeding where the person whose statements are at issue is being used to adjudicate that person's guilt or punishment for purposes of criminal liability.
That's the first reason. It has to be at trial.
So, in making that argument, Mr. Heytens, you are recognizing that you are shrinking to almost a vanishing point the possibility of using the Fifth Amendment to block the use against you of incriminating -- the -- you -- you're shrinking the privilege to nothing because there aren't many trials nowadays; upwards of 95 percent of cases are disposed of by plea bargaining.
So, by limiting the Fifth Amendment to there must be a trial, there must be a witness at trial, you're saying effectively the Fifth Amendment, which is considered very important, is out of the picture in most criminal cases. I don't think that's -- that's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the reason for that is that it's critical to distinguish between two issues. The first issue is when can the privilege against self-incrimination be invoked, and the second is when the Self-Incrimination Clause can actually be -- can actually be violated.

But as Judge Friendly summarized this Court's Blackledge-Menna doctrine, a defendant who pleads guilty can challenge the -- challenge his conviction on any constitutional ground that, if asserted before trial, would forever preclude the State from obtaining a valid conviction against him. Petitioner's claim here is that the Second Amendment and Due Process Clause preclude the government from ever obtaining a valid conviction against him.
It thus falls well within the scope of the Blackledge-Menna doctrine. The government's main contention is that Petitioner was required to preserve his claim through a conditional plea, but as the drafters of Rule 11(a)(2) noted in the advisory notes to that -- to that rule, the -- the Supreme Court has held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be raised after a plea of guilty, Rule 11(a)(2) has no application to such situations and should not be interpreted as either broadening or narrowing the Blackledge-Menna except -- the Blackledge-Menna doctrine or as establishing procedures for its application.

Both the double jeopardy and prosecutorial vindictiveness claim are waiveable.
And so our contention here is not that these claims cannot be waived.
Our contention here is that they were not explicitly waived in the plea agreement and they were not otherwise forfeited by operation of the plea itself.

That's why when the four judges at issue here began to serve as appointed judges on the CMCR, the Court of Military Commission Review, it violated the dual office-holding ban and disqualified them from hearing the Petitioners' appeals. Congress created the Court of Military Commission Review in 2006 as part of the Military Commissions Act, and the initial plan for the CMCR was modeled very much on the then-existing courts of criminal appeals in the court-martial system, right down to how the judges were to be selected.
So, in the original language of the 2006 Act, judges could be assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the CMCR, and those judges could either be civilians or military officers. In 2009, when Congress turned around the CMCR, when Congress decided to make it more independent of the executive branch, one of the measures it pursued was to bifurcate that provision and to break out the assignment of military officers and the appointment of ""additional judges"" by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. And it's our submission that when Congress did so, it created a civil office and it did not expressly authorize military officers to hold that civil office.

The answer to that question is yes. By its plain terms, the statutory definition applies to the entirety of the section, including the anti-retaliation provision.
Far from being absurd, that plain text interpretation is entirely consistent with the history and the structure of the whistleblower provisions and with Congress's overarching objective of promoting reporting to the SEC. It also preserves the balance between the Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which already provides broad protections to whistleblowers who report internally.
And even if the statute were somehow ambiguous, the SEC's interpretation is not entitled to deference because its rule-making was procedurally defective.
This Court should reject the interpretation of the Ninth Circuit, and it should reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit in this case. Now, by its terms, the Dodd-Frank Act's anti-retaliation provision prohibits retaliation only against a particular category of persons; namely, whistleblowers.
And the statutory definition of whistleblower, again by its terms, applies in this section. That section, of course, indisputably includes the anti-retaliation provision, as well as the award provisions.
And, therefore, the anti-retaliation provision only applies to individuals who meet the statutory definition of whistleblower; again, individuals who have reported securities law violations to the SEC. Now, as I said at the outset, we believe that that's consistent with the history, structure, and objectives of the whistleblower provisions. As to the history, perhaps the most telling fact is the fact that an earlier version of the anti-retaliation provision reached all employees.
Congress then amended the provision to apply to a narrower set of individuals, whistleblowers. As to the structure of these provisions, in our view, the anti-retaliation provision protects the very class of persons to whom the award provisions provide incentives, and, therefore, the anti-retaliation provision in a very real sense works hand-and-glove with the anti-retaliation -- with the award provisions.

Because of the clarity with which the FAA speaks to enforcing arbitration agreements as written, the FAA will only yield in the face of a contrary congressional command and the tie goes to arbitration.
Applying those principles to Section 7 of the NLRA, the result is clear that the FAA should not yield. Is that a concession that this is a concerted action?

Well, I think what you would say, Justice Kennedy, is the concerted activity that's protected by Section 7 at most gets them to the threshold of the courthouse. But Section 7 is directed to the workplace, not the courthouse.
And what it protects is their right in the workplace to decide they want to initiate action, but then, once they get to the courthouse -- But the courthouse, Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement, the courthouse is not at issue here as I understand it.
These employees say we don't object to arbitration, but what we do object to is the one-on-one, the employee against the employer. And the driving force of the NLRA was the recognition that there was an imbalance, that there was no true liberty of contract, so that's why they said, in the NLRA, concerted activity is to be protected against employ -- employer interference That's right, Justice Ginsburg, but it's collective action by the employees in the workplace.

With respect to the Special Master, we believe he -- he made a legal error on this discrete issue, that the case should be returned to him for him to complete the work that he has begun. Mr. Garre, I thought that the Special Master -- this is at page 63 to 65 of his report -- said that Florida at the trial concentrated only on the harm from the low flows in drought years and it did not address the benefits of increased flow during normal non-drought periods. It didn't even address it, he said, no -- no less showed the benefits that it would gain.
So he said if -- if Florida has not established its case, it's Florida's fault because all they did was concentrate on the drought years. Right.
And I think, first of all, the Special Master's entire report has to be viewed in light of the legal standard of redressability that he applied.
And we believe that he applied far too great of a standard. Second of all, I think it is fair to say that Florida's presentation was focused on the harm that we suffered during drought conditions in the extreme low-flow periods. But two things about that are important to understand. There's two ways to redress that harm. One is to provide more water during those periods, the extreme low-flow periods, the worst of the worst, and the other way is to reduce the frequency and severity of",1.0

You have a -- a strong argument there.

Would that change the calculus so that, if you're in one part of the state, you have a First Amendment interest in having your party strong or the other party weak? No, it wouldn't, Your Honor.
And I think the reason for that is, even if it's a First Amendment issue, it's still grounded in the right to vote. And in our country's single district election system, folks only vote in their own district.
For example, you might have some vague interest in the party that you associate with having more members in Congress, for example, like a Wisconsin Republican might want more Texas Republicans in Congress. But no one would say that you have a First Amendment or a first -- Fourteenth Amendment right in that sort of circumstance to challenge some Texas law that you would, for example, argue led to less Republicans from Texas coming to the Congress.

With respect to the first two instances, the student association or student fees and the bar association fees, those cases are distinguishable for reasons stated in Harris. They're justified by different interests. The state bar associations are justified by the state's compelling government interest in regulating the practice of law before its courts.
The student association fees are justified by the government's or what -- a university's compelling interest in setting up a viewpoint-neutral forum for speech. And then, with respect to the private sector cases, they hinge on a question of state action.

If I may, I'd like to begin with the arriving alien subclass. The statutory provision that's most directly at issue for these purposes is at page 152a of the petition appendix. And this one deals particularly with what -- what I think is the most important subset of the arriving alien subclass; that is, individuals who come to the country for the first time, they pass a credible fear screening for asylum purposes, and they're then placed in removal proceedings. And near the top of page 152a, in Romanette II, referral of certain aliens, it says if the asylum officer determines at the time of the interview that the alien has a credible fear of persecution, the alien shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum. And so, in the very provision in which Congress was dealing with aliens who passed the credible fear screening, it was making clear that the finding of a credible fear confers no entitlement to be released into the United States.
It's an important step in the process because it means that the alien won't be placed in expedited removal and have -- will have a thorough chance to -- to prove his compliance with the prerequisites for asylum, but it doesn't confer any right to be released into the United States.

And it makes perfect -- The problem really is that the guidelines are a little confusing. They talk about an initial guidelines range, and then they tell the court that the real guideline range is a statutory minimum.
So that it's talking about the guidelines doesn't resolve that question because which guideline are they talking about? In my mind, they're told they have to start from the statutory minimum in their departure.
So how do we get away from that fact? Well, Justice Sotomayor, we don't think that's actually the way the guidelines are properly read.
I think you're referring to Section 5G1.1. Yes. And in that section, what it says is that if there's a statutorily required minimum sentence, then the judge shall adjust the guideline range to that minimum. But remember the whole point of a Section 3553(e) motion is to say that the minimum does not apply.

The government's theory does not fit Section 3663A's plain text, and it cannot explain the clear and obvious differences between this statute and other restitution provisions, which, unlike here -- where, unlike here, Congress did provide make-whole relief. The government tries to make up for these deficiencies by citing statements in the legislative history, broad declarations of Congress's purpose, and the ordinary definition of restitution.
None of these appear anywhere in the statute. The government looks everywhere but the statutory text because the language and logic of the provision is directly at odds with the government's reading.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the discharge of debts procured by fraudulent statements, other than a statement respecting the debtor's financial condition. Everyone agrees that ""financial condition"" is a term of art used by Congress and in commercial practice to refer to one's overall financial status.
Yet, Respondent and the government ask this Court to interpret Section 523 and, in particular, Congress's use of ""respecting"" to eliminate the meaning of ""financial condition,"" of a term of art, and essentially to substitute the word ""finances"" for it.

Can you tell me, Mr. Garre, what is a statement respecting financial condition? In addition to a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement, what else would qualify? Sure.
Well, our view is that a statement respecting financial condition is a statement that purports to present a picture of one's overall financial situation. And there are several things that could qualify as -- as that. One would, of course, be a classic balance statement or sheet.
Another would be an indication of net -- net wealth or overall income -- a net -- net worth.
Another would be a credit score, such as those that were common in 1926, when Congress passed this statute. Another would be net cash flow. All of these things look to one's overall financial situation, not to just one side of the ledger, an asset or a liability, and present a picture of overall financial status. And, again, Respondent's interpretation of ""respecting"" essentially eliminates that term as a term of limitation and as a term of art and substitutes the word ""finances"" for it.
So a statement about any individual input, any individual asset, any individual liability suddenly becomes a statement respecting financial condition. And I think there are three central problems with -- with -- with Respondent's interpretation of ""respecting."" The first is, as I mentioned, that -- that their reading of ""respecting"" to mean ""related to"" eliminates Congress's decision to use the term of art ""financial condition.""

The distinction in Hartman, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg, comes and rests entirely on the fact that there was absolute prosecutorial immunity for the actor who actually imposed the injury there. And I see three major distinctions between Hartman and what's going on in this case. The first of those is that, in Hartman, there was absolute prosecutorial immunity.
And what that meant is you could not sue the prosecutor; you had to sue somebody upstream.
But the reason why there's absolute prosecutorial immunity, as this Court explained in the decisions it cited in Hartman, in Reno and in Wayte, is because the Court wants to avoid inquiry into prosecutorial decision-making, and that's so because prosecutors are both independent and deliberative.

In the 20-plus years since the statute was enacted, virtually all the district courts have interpreted it literally.
They identify an appropriate portion of the judgment, not exceeding 25 percent, and they deduct that amount from the attorney fee award payable by the defendant. In our case, the Seventh Circuit read the statute differently to mean that attorney's fees must be taken out of the damages first, up to 25 percent of the damages, so that the defendant is only liable for any fees left over. But the statute does not say that. All it says is that the portion of the judgment -- is that a portion of the judgment no greater than 25 percent must be allocated to fees. Respondents mistakenly suggest that Congress's use of the word ""satisfy"" indicates that the plaintiff has to pay the largest possible share of the fees in all cases.
But that can't be right because the statute itself says what share the plaintiff has to pay: a portion of the judgment, not exceeding 25 percent. The rest of the attorney's fee award in excess of the plaintiff's share is payable by the defendant, up to the statutory cap of 150 percent of the damages.
There's nothing in the statute -- Your adversary points to a number of statutes that use the verb ""to satisfy"" -- or I guess not the verb, but the proposition ""to satisfy"" -- to refer to the complete fulfillment of an obligation.

This Court decided a very similar case in the Casey decision from Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania imposed that requirement in the context of an informed consent discussion.

Why do you think that those 10 requirements of what have to be in a notice to appear define a notice to appear? You could imagine a case where somebody says, well, look, Requirement 7 isn't in the notice.
That was a mistake.
So it's a flawed notice to appear, but it's still a notice to appear.
It doesn't become not a notice to appear because there's a flaw in it. Well, right.
So the answer to that, Justice Kagan, is -- is the way that the statute is written.
And because Section 1229(a) doesn't just -- doesn't just state what a notice to appear shall contain, it does define what a notice to appear is because of the language Congress used.

And in the context of the guidelines, a guidelines error directly frustrates the very purposes served by the sentencing guidelines scheme: the congressional goals to promote uniformity and proportionality and to avoid unwarranted disparity; to achieve parsimony, meaning that a defendant is sentenced to the least amount of time necessary to effectuate the statutory goals; and to have respect for the district court -- No, and these are all reasons that you would consider when the question is -- when there's an objection and the question is raised.

For example, MLB, taking away parental rights, is a civil proceeding.

But I'm not concerned about your scheme as such. I'm concerned about the many unanswered questions that overturning precedents will create a massive amount of lawsuits about. I know you've told us that Quill has created its own set of lawsuits, I guess every law does, but here there are some significant ones.
You're not retroactive, but your adversaries point out that there are many states who have already made this collection retroactive.
So we have that question. We have questions about what's the contact that you have to do to impose this obligation.
Are we going to decide it under Complete Auto? Are we going to decide it under Pike balancing? How much contact is enough to justify placing this obligation on an out-of-town seller? So there's going to be a host of questions.
What happens when the tax program breaks down, as it already has for the states who are using it, and merchants can't keep track of who they've sold to? All of these are questions that are wrought with difficulties. So you're introducing now a whole new set of difficulties to put be -- to put behind something that's been in place for 30 years now?

And the worrisome thing about this is that the President acts; Congress is the one responsible for making the laws about immigration.
It has been suggested in one of the briefs that we read 1182(f) to allow the President to suspend entry but only for a period of time long enough for Congress to say yea or nay. Your Honor, yes, 1182(f) is a broad and flexible power in a narrow area.
Here, however, I think that you don't need to explore those outer limits because the proclamation's meant to help implement the INA by making sure that we have the minimum level of information needed to determine if aliens are admissible under the INA.

It's a two-prong test. Historically, when this Court has -- has applied -- It's two prongs, that means -- let's assume the district court had found that this couple was an intimate couple that lived together, exchanged payments of their expenses, were like a married couple.

So why -- you describe it as if it's only a disclosure, but it's really a search. So, Justice Sotomayor, it -- it's a hybrid instrument that has two functions.
The first function operates directly on the provider.
It requires a provider to make disclosure of information. That is a function that's classically performed by a subpoena or a discovery order.
It does not authorize the government to go in, sit down at Microsoft's facilities, put hands on keyboards -- Well, actually, it does.
If you read -- if you read the provision, it's an -- an alternative for that, meaning the provision provides for a warrant that presumably would let the government do just that if it chose. So, presumably, not because the statute actually says that the government can get a warrant requiring disclosure.
The act that -- that occurs in the case is an act on the provider.
And the fundamental distinction between a search and a subpoena-type instrument is that in a search the government does go right in and grab the information. In a subpoena context, the instrument operates on a person and it places an obligation on that person to make disclosure. Once it gets to the government, once the government has the account in hand, it executes the warrant aspect of the order, which is a probable-cause-based order, allowing the government to search the account.

Congress provided a cause of action for the domestic infringement and provided a damages remedy that guaranteed the victim of the infringement damages adequate to compensate for the infringement.

Except there's one feature of this that's -- I mean, it's one -- Congress, in 271(f), wanted the infringer to be liable.
And that's -- that's -- there's no doubt about that. But all of the activity occurs -- not only does the activity occur abroad sweeping the high seas, but the one who is causing the injury is not the infringer; it's the customer of the infringer.

Typically, the things that would constitute money remuneration obviously would be cash, paper notes, coins, but it would also encompass more modern ways of transferring currency, such as direct deposit or a check.

Today, those same products are used without asbestos on Navy ships. Why is that? Did they discover something new that's better than asbestos? They did, in fact. Technology advanced and there were different forms of insulation, and the Navy eventually transitioned to those forms.

Your Honor, as a factual matter, after being denied the material, he did engage in some cross-examination that appears in the record.
But I think critical, Your Honor, is that, without the material itself, any meaningful cross-examination regarding the expert's methodology, the provenance of the expert's labor market surveys was impossible. And I would note that it would be a rare case when you would be asked to cross-examine a statistical expert who is opining upon specific numbers that the expert has then modified through calculations without actually seeing the data sources itself. I think this Court's decision in Florida Power & Light is an important precedent in this respect because, there, the Court noted that the testimony, the well-founded testimony of an expert may be enough if firsthand information is unavailable. And, here, particularly because there were two sources the expert relied upon, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which was public, but then also her private labor market surveys, which the ALJ never saw and we never saw, that made any form of cross-examination or meaningful inquiry into the basis for these numbers impossible.

This reading of Section 3731(b)(2) contradicts this Court's interpretive approach in the Graham case, it defies default tolling rules, and it would produce counterintuitive results that Congress cannot possibly have intended. Let me begin with the text.
In this Court's decision in Graham, interpreting the False Claims Act, it held that these provisions must be interpreted in context, not in isolation.
And, in particular, it -- it focused on the language under -- under Section 3730, which is contained in Section 3731(b)(2). And, here, the statutory context confirms that that language, ""action under Section 3730,"" as incorporated into subsection (b)(2), is limited to those actions where the United States is a party, either because it's intervened or it filed a complaint. And Graham said -- Isn't the United States in some sense a party even if it hasn't intervened?

Section 406(b) speaks only of work done before the court. Congress also, Your Honor, knew how to create an aggregate cap if it wanted to.
In Section 406(a)(2)(C), it creates an aggregate cap for claims in cases involving both claims under Title 2 and Title 16, and it uses the words ""in the aggregate.""

Respondent's brief expressed doubts about redressability, but redressability and the other two requirements of Article III standing are established here. First, our injury in fact is the disclosure of our members' store-level sales information that they keep secret. Not if the government decides that it doesn't want to give it.
We already have a case that says, if the government voluntarily chooses to disclose, you're stuck; you can't appeal. So, here, the government chose not to appeal.
It chose, by definition, to turn it over.
Why aren't you bound by that decision? We're not bound for it because the intervention that we successfully moved in the District of South Dakota made us a proper party.
We have an interest that allowed us to intervene. But the -- if you had been a part of the -- if you had been the original asker, we have a case that says -- Crystal City -- that if the government chooses to turn it over, you can't appeal. And the government did not make that choice.
So there are really five things. Well, but they haven't made the choice on this exemption. They've made the choice because of a new law. Isn't the proper course for them to go back to the district court with a motion for reconsideration or for them to petition the court or for you to go to the court or for -- or -- or for someone else to go to the court and say they have to turn it over? No, Your Honor.
The government in this case made a number of steps that make clear that our redressability is not only likely but certain.
And let me start because standing at the time -- Well, it's not certain until the district court relieves them of the earlier judgment, telling them that Exemption 3 didn't apply. Well, that -- that premise, I think, is -- is a",1.0

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Title VII's exhaustion requirement is satisfied, the power to address an employment discrimination claim shifts from the executive to the judicial branch.
The exhaustion requirement is, therefore, jurisdictional in the plainest sense of that word. And that is confirmed in at least three ways.
First, the text and structure of Section 2000e-5 demonstrates that the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, ensuring that courts do not reach the merits of a claim before it has been presented to the expert agency. But the expert agency, unlike the examples that you give of agencies that have adjudicatory authority, the EEOC has no authority to adjudicate.

Yes, you have to let the complaint stay there for 180 days, but they don't decide anything, or even if they decide they dismiss your claim, that has no preclusive effect in the court. So it's one thing to say when Congress sets up a scheme where the agency is the equivalent of a court of first instance, it makes a decision and that decision is reviewed. But, in a Title VII case, the court is never reviewing the decision of the EEOC because they don't have any authority to make decisions. Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the important question with respect to jurisdiction is whether the agency has been empowered to attempt to resolve a claim. I don't think whether the resolution -- the way that it resolves it, whether -- whether -- the way that it's been empowered to resolve it, whether it's adjudicatory or non-adversarial, I don't think that matters. What matters is whether Congress vested authority in the agency to attempt to resolve it. And I think, with respect to Title VII, it's correct, the agency is not using adversarial proceedings.
And that's because, as we know, Congress intended for employment discrimination claims to be resolved in a non-adversarial manner, to be resolved through conciliation or cooperation or means like that. And so it wanted the agency to have the power to do that. And leaving the door open for the adversarial judicial process at the same time would certainly have undercut that intention.

Well, but as to that, it seems to me one reason the case is a little confusing is that I think you're right, registration could mean either.
But, in a situation where you've got a registrar, it seems to me that the most likely understanding of ""registration"" is what that person does. But, Your Honor, that's not the way the statute uses the language.

It says that registration may be made upon the filing of a single application and fee.

All the parties before the Court agree that, even though Mr. Garza signed an appeal waiver, that certain fundamental claims survive that appeal waiver. So, when the appeal is reinstated, the plea agreement will remain intact.

It's not between Archer and Schein.
How does Schein get to claim the benefit of an agreement Schein did not make? Justice Ginsburg, there is a question in the case concerning non-parties.
The agreements in question are agreements with some of the defendants, not all of them. And so, therefore, as to the non-signatory defendants, there is a question reserved by the court of appeals about the doctrine of equitable estoppel, and that would be an issue for the court of appeals to address on remand if this Court agrees with us on the question presented.

But, on the question presented, I think our submission is quite straightforward.

As a result, the treaty right has not terminated, and Petitioner should have been permitted to invoke that right during his criminal prosecution for hunting in the Bighorn National Forest.

Under 1441(a) and traditional diversity jurisdiction, 1332(a), you're correct that all defendants have to remove as a part of the procedure under 1446. Here, though, in Shamrock Oil, the Court went through the history of removal and diversity, understood that it was very important to the framers that diversity jurisdiction was in the original constitution, Article III, Section 2.
Removal was in the original Judiciary Act of 1789, so it was important to the framers that each side have one shot at a -- at a federal forum. But that's not true. Presume -- All defendants don't have a shot at removal.
Only if everybody agrees, in an original action, all defendants have to agree to removal, correct? That is correct, Your Honor. So not every",0.0

Of course -- I know you think that, but this was a hypothetical. Well, Your Honor, the Federal Circuit below rested its decision on complete reliance on Auer deference, so we think that that is the principal question that was presented by the Federal Circuit. So we think the first order of business is to determine whether or not the Federal Circuit was correct in deciding that Auer deference resolved this case. But the government tells us it's really beside the point because not only -- well, either the regulation is unambiguous or, if there's any ambiguity, the Federal Circuit's reading, the -- the Veterans Administration's reading is by far the better reading. Your Honor, the Federal Circuit, though, relied on Auer deference because the government asked the Federal Circuit to do so.
The government expressly argued to the Federal Circuit that Auer deference applies in this case, and the Federal Circuit took the government's invitation to rest its decision on Auer deference.

Because lack of compensation is not an element of her federal takings claim, state compensation remedies do not bear on the presentation of the claim in federal court. How is it not an element of her claim? There's no violation unless she is denied just compensation? Well, Your Honor, in the inverse condemnation context, the problem is not that the government's violating the Just Compensation Clause by failing to pay.
The problem is that it's depriving her of her right to just compensation because it does not recognize that it's -- an invasion of her property is a taking that triggers the entitlement to compensation. Well, I thought that was the whole point of an inverse condemnation.
They recognize that they owe her money, and the whole point of the process, which can be fairly elaborate, is that they're just trying to figure out how much.
If it's not enough, then she can bring a claim. But it seems to me that it's imposing a considerable burden on the state or the local entities to say you've got to pay right away; in other words, go through some sort of process to figure out what you owe before you can even -- you know, it's -- it's simply a process to figure out how much is due.

The understanding adopted well before Williamson County and Dow and other cases is that the invasion itself gives rise to a constitutionally rooted claim for compensation, unless, as in Cherokee Nation, the government recognizes the owner's entitlement to compensation and provides a process for collecting it at the time of the invasion. This is the understanding that controls in takings cases against the United States under the Tucker Act, and there's no reason why we should have a different constitutional interpretation of the Just Compensation Clause simply because the defendant is a local government entity. But, in fact, Williamson County does adopt a conflicting and anomalous and mistaken interpretation of the Just Compensation Clause in holding that an invasion of property is not without compensation and not actionable under the Takings Clause until state remedies are exhausted. A basis for this understanding is this Court's decision -- the initial basis is the Great Falls Manufacturing case.
This is 1884. And in that case, this Court said that when a property owner has their property invaded, they are entitled from that moment to go seek compensation on a constitutional basis.
So -- Well, I mean, the -- the question is whether or not to overrule Williamson County.

First, permitting liability under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) and 17(a) would allow plaintiffs to sidestep this Court's holding in Janus and the limitations that were placed on misstatement liability.
And it would allow plaintiffs to creatively relabel their inadequate misstatement claims as claims for deceptive devices and acts.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' express theory is that the FDA, fully informed of the risk of atypical femoral fractures, ignored that risk and its own statutory and regulatory responsibilities because it didn't like the way Merck phrased its proposed warning. That cannot be right.
If a manufacturer, as Merck did here, informs the FDA of a possible risk and unsuccessfully asks to revise its label in light of that risk, then failure to warn claims based on that risk are preempted as a matter of law. That rule follows from the statutory and regulatory framework governing the FDA's conduct and from the presumption of regularity. The presumption of regularity, of course, assumes that federal agencies do their jobs correctly. The FDA's job in this case includes protecting the public health by working with manufacturers to revise drug labels when necessary. Mr. Dvoretzky, let me give you a -- a -- a hypothetical because I think we can -- could all agree that if you had proposed a warning, let -- let me just say major -- major fractures versus stress fractures, and if you had proposed a warning that dealt with major fractures and the FDA had said no, we don't think that the literature supports that, then there's nothing you can do, and you should be immune from any suit. I think that that's pretty clear.
The question is sort of, you know, did -- did you propose a different kind of warning? So let me give you a hypothetical. Suppose that you manufacture a drug and there's some evidence, whether it's enough, hard to know, but there's some evidence that it causes ovarian cancer, and you, the drug manufacturer, proposes a warning to the FDA, but instead of saying that the drug causes ovarian cancer, you say it causes ovarian cysts. Now ovarian cysts are nothing that anybody wants to have, but they're an inconvenience.
They're not ovarian cancer. And the FDA says: No, we don't think that that's the issue at all. Does that mean that you're off the hook now with respect to revising your label to say that your product causes ovarian cancer? I don't think that",1.0

And nothing in Taylor or the sources that existed at the time of ACCA suggest an intention or acknowledgment of making such a dramatic change.

That was a linchpin to the structure that Congress set up.
It created a new adversarial administrative process, and part of that balance was to ensure that patent holders that were subject to that new adversarial process could then be protected from having to go back and relitigate in court, in district court or the International Trade Commission. Your position is that it's -- the estoppel provision is the linchpin, you just said, but your position would be the same even if there were no estoppel provision.
Is that not so? That is correct, Your Honor.
It's just the linchpin to the balance. It's a reinforcement.
The Dictionary Act definition and the presumptive definition would do the work here because that is the reliance by Congress and the give-and-take before the branches so Congress knows how the word ""person"" is going to be interpreted when they use it. So the linchpin part of the estoppel, though, reinforces that because it only refers specifically to the court -- the district court and International Trade Commission. And the third point I wanted to make, Your Honor, was that this does not exclude the government from going after bad patents.

We have here two words, ""full costs."" We actually agree, my friend Mr. Clement and I, on ""full."" It means all or all that can be contained or complete or something of that nature. The dispute is on ""costs"" because just as the full moon doesn't tell us anything about Mars and Venus, ""full costs,"" we submit, doesn't tell the court anything about fees and expenses. And Congress has been careful in separating out those concepts, and this Court has been careful in separating them out. Murphy, the case that involved costs under the IDEA, specifically contrasted the word ""costs"" with the word ""expenses"" and said ""expenses"" is open-ended and might include travel expenses and salaries and so forth, whereas costs, we know, are these things under Section 1920. And in Murphy, the Court told all of us, the lower courts and the bar, and Congress, what it takes to override that presumption.

Once we decided the one-person, one-vote concept, we've been pretty much in all of our jurisprudence saying that certain acts by the legislature are unconstitutional, including race discrimination and others. It can't be that simply because the Constitution says that a particular act is in the hands of one -- one branch of government, that that deprives the courts of reviewing whether that action is constitutional or not. Well, Justice Sotomayor, I suppose the question of whether that ship sailed in Baker v. Carr is one way of presenting the question before the Court today. And I would submit that you don't have a one-size-fits-all solution for justiciability, and I don't think Baker v. Carr supports that proposition. Indeed, I took the central lesson of Baker v.

It did. The question of exhaustion ordinarily arises as a threshold matter as an affirmative defense in any case challenging agency action, as this Court held in Jones against Bock. Thus, if the government is not inclined to waive the Appeals Council's determination that a claimant failed to file a timely request for review, the government is free to raise it as an affirmative defense. And the district court, in turn, of course has the authority to resolve the merits of that affirmative defense, to either sustain or overrule the government's affirmative defense of failure to exhaust by -- by reviewing the Appeals Council's decision for substantial evidence or otherwise abuse of discretion.

A victim can resist to any particular extent, and, in fact, the case law in Florida confirms that resistance sufficient for a robbery conviction and a penalty up to 15 years in the state penitentiary can involve nothing more than the tightening of one's hand momentarily on a dollar bill before releasing it.

So, for example, the statute expands the Glacier Bay National Monument.
It says that the monument shall be managed for the following purposes among others, to protect a segment of the Alsek River fish and wildlife habitats and migration routes and a portion of the Fairweather Range. Or take another example.
ANILCA creates the Kobuk Valley National Park, which it says shall be managed for the following purposes: among others, to keep it in an undeveloped state.
So the agency has a statutory duty to manage these parks for the purpose of maintaining the Kobuk River, the Alsek River, and other rivers.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the wake of the nation's failed experiment with prohibition, the Twenty-First Amendment restored to the states the powers that they previously had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts.
In exercising those powers, both before prohibition and in its immediate aftermath, states enacted residency requirements, like Tennessee's, to regulate the sale of alcohol within their territory. All along the way, this Court recognized the states' power to do so as part of their virtually complete control over how to structure the liquor distribution system. Under Granholm, that unbroken and undisputed history is dispositive.
Residency requirements like Tennessee's are protected from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny because they were authorized by the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts and uniformly considered constitutional at the time of ratification. Respondents offer -- Could I ask you to clarify for me your position? Justice Sutton, in his dissent, basically said, if your legislature came and said we don't want out-of-state wholesalers, distributors, or retailers to be in our chain of distribution, because they're going to take business away from our local enterprises, period, end of story -- are you saying that the state can do that? Are you disagreeing with Justice -- with Judge Sutton? Or do you think that there's an economic protectionism -- protection against what a state can do? So I don't think that there is an economic protectionism exception to the Twenty-First Amendment, but even if there were one, as Judge Sutton recognized in applying his test to the two-year residency requirement in this case -- The problem is -- -- we would still prevail. Well, except we have a difficulty there, which is you can't look at legislation piecemeal.
You have to look at it as a whole. It was written as a whole.
It's one paragraph that says two years, plus 10.
So it's really 12 years because -- and he said there's no economic justification for a 10-year residency requirement.
So what you have to look at is not whether it's two years but whether there's any reason for a 12-year residency requirement.
I mean, if he said no to 10, then it's no to 12. So, Justice Sotomayor, that -- that gets",0.0

Well, Your Honor -- On a preponderance of the evidence? -- there was no jail for an additional period of time here. Petitioner's original sentence, which was authorized by the jury's verdict, included a 10-year period of supervised release, which is precisely analogous to a 10-year term of automatic parole.

I thought that prior to Mathis, the government acknowledged that generic burglary did not include motor vehicles as habitations? I don't think that's quite right, Your Honor.
Before Mathis, this issue didn't come up as often because, obviously, the government often had two arguments it could make.
It would make a divisibility argument as well as a mobile dwellings argument, but the government did, in many of the court of appeals cases going back to the '90s and the early 2000s, actually make this argument. Again, it's become more important following Mathis because now the divisibility analysis is harder, and so, in more cases, the outcome is actually turning on whether burglary is capacious enough to include the very types of burglaries that, as we note in the brief, at least 44 states would have counted in 1986. I have little problem understanding your argument with respect to mobile homes or floating homes. Those are structures that don't have any propulsion -- self-propulsion mechanisms.

Consider just how pointed and clear the constitutional text is.
Congress is not only to be granting copyrights but securing them, and the resulting rights by definition are meant to be exclusive rights.
Exclusive against whom, Your Honors? Exclusive against all comers, exclusive against the world, including the government and including states. And this exercise of congressional power serves the express constitutional purpose to promote progress.
How? By affording monetary recompense to copyright holders.
The framers thus made very clear that all those wanting to use an author's copyright are meant to be paying money for doing so. This clause's text signals a plan of the convention waiver like no other in Article I.
For states to retain immunity to avoid paying for infringing the very same exclusive rights that Congress is meant to secure would be incompatible with the text as fixed and understood by the framers. And this Court has already so recognized in substance.
Going back to 1888, in United States v. Palmer, the Court said in holding the federal government monetarily liable for infringing patents that Congress's power, the same power we were just talking about, could not be affected if the government had a reserve right to infringe.
Same reasoning holds for states, Your Honors. And in Goldstein v. California in 1973, the Court said -- and, again, in -- here discussing copyrights -- when Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its effects are pervasive.

The answer should be no. CERCLA entrusts EPA to protect human health and the environment by developing a remedial plan that protects the whole community. Respondents are profoundly wrong that removing waste is always better than leaving it in place. Superfund sites contain extremely hazardous substances, lead, mercury, plutonium, to name a few.

Excavation, transportation, and disposal of these substances is risky not only to neighbors but the millions of people who live next door to Superfund sites.
Whether these risks are worth any benefits should be evaluated by EPA, not juries on an ad hoc basis. Since 2013, EPA has objected that Respondents' restoration remedy would thwart more than three decades of efforts -- of its efforts at the Anaconda site, including by digging up soil that EPA wants left undisturbed and by building miles of underground trenches that would affect an entire community's groundwater. This Court should reverse for three reasons.
First, Section 113 bars Respondents' challenge to EPA's remedy. Second, Section 122 bars Respondents from undertaking any remedial actions absent EPA's authorization. And, third, a restoration remedy is preempted because it would require Atlantic Richfield to effectuate the very cleanup that federal law prohibits the company from doing on its own, and a restoration remedy would prevent EPA from carrying out its statutory mandate to implement comprehensive cleanups.

That's true regardless of whether the prohibited characteristic at issue is a but-for cause of the final decision. That's the rule that the MSPB and the EEOC have applied in countless cases for many years, but more importantly it flows directly from the statutory text. The phrase ""free from any discrimination"" governs how the decision shall be made.
In other words, the process for making that decision.
If that process uses age or race as a negative factor, it's not made free from any discrimination. Congress chose those words carefully rejecting the private sector language later addressed in Gross and Nassar.
It did so in the unique federal sector context to create a remedy for violating constitutional equal protection rights.
This Court has said that when a plaintiff is subjected to discrimination in the process of being considered for a government benefit, he necessarily suffers a redressable equal protection injury even if he can't prove he otherwise would have received a benefit. That same injury rule governs 633a and Title VII.
That rule is fully consistent with common law principles and this Court's but-for causation analysis in other cases. The government, in this case, apparently believes it's perfectly lawful for federal agencies to apply younger-is-better or whiter-is-better hiring policies to individuals who can't prove that they would have been hired but for those policies.
That's anti-textual and it's wrong. Decisions applying such blatantly discriminatory policies are obviously not made free from any discrimination.
The government's theory contradicts the plain statutory language. But you say that the but-for causation is not required for liability, but then at the relief stage, as I understand your briefs, you say that but-for causation is required for reinstatement or back pay.

AEDPA did not change this settled practice, and nothing in this Court's Gonzalez decision suggests otherwise. Rule 60(b) motions present obvious opportunities to circumvent AEDPA's restrictions, as the facts in Gonzalez itself well illustrate.
There, the motion was filed years after the judgment and well after the end of any appellate proceedings. Rule 59(e) motions are different. They have to be filed within 28 days of judgment, they suspend the judgment's finality, and they result in a single appeal. Second, by dismissing Mr. Banister's appeal as untimely, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized him for following the plain terms of Appellate Rule 4(a).
There's no basis in the rule or in AEDPA for retroactively recharacterizing a timely Rule 59(e) motion and treating it as though it were never filed for purposes of Rule 4(a). On this issue, Texas and the United States notably rely on a new argument, as their position is that Mr. Banister's Rule 59 motion shouldn't count because it wasn't filed properly.
But the basic problem with that argument is there's no properly filed requirement in Rule 4(a). And we think this Court should reject the government's invitation to rewrite the plain terms of that rule, which would significantly complicate what is supposed to be a clear, straightforward jurisdictional inquiry and would have implications for all civil proceedings in addition to habeas. I'd like to start with our first argument, and on that issue, our -- our rule is clear.

That exception is limited to a narrow category of calls that intrude less severely on consumer privacy than does the typical automated call and that serve an important countervailing interest in protecting the federal fisc. There's been a good deal of back and forth in the briefs about whether Respondents' challenge is properly viewed as one to the exception or to the general automated-call restriction.
And I think, in circumstances like this, there's not a right way and a wrong way, not a right or wrong challenge to bring. There's simply two conceptually distinct analytical -- analytical ways of challenging a law that includes a basic restriction subject to exceptions. Here, we think that both challenges could have been brought but that both would fail.
But I'd like to focus first on the challenge that Respondent is asserting in its brief.
These are the -- this is the challenge that Respondents are asking the Court to focus on. And that is the challenge to the underlying automated-call restriction.
And Respondents' basic theory is that the government-debt exception, taken in combination with other aspects of the statutory scheme, prevents the automated-call restriction from performing its intended consumer protection function, renders it insufficiently efficacious to be upheld under the First Amendment.

In this case, neither condition is satisfied.
Petitioner was not found inadmissible.
He wasn't capable of being found inadmissible.
Therefore, he was not rendered inadmissible. So I'd like to begin this morning with a concession the government makes at pages 29 and 30 of its brief which I think narrows the issues in this case somewhat.
So the government concedes that when the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable,"" which are the crucial words in the stop-time rule, when those words are used in a statute that has a connection to the alien's own removal proceeding, they're a reference to the charge against the alien at that proceeding. They're not a status. So the government agrees that in those contexts, its proposed interpretation of the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule is incorrect.
So, in Section 1226, the mandatory detention statute, that says that an alien who is inadmissible by reason of having committed an offense under Section 1182 is subject to mandatory detention, the government agrees there that ""inadmissible"" is a reference to inadmissible at the proceeding, not just the status of being inadmissible. The government says that's natural in that context, and we agree, because that's a statute with the relationship to the alien's removal. Same thing in Section 1252.
That's the jurisdiction-stripping statute.
That says that courts of appeals don't have jurisdiction to hear petitions for review by an alien who is removable for certain specified reasons.

And that discrimination is because of sex, again in the words of Section 703(a), because the adverse employment action is based on the male employee's failure to conform to a particular expectation about how men should behave; namely, that men should be attracted only to women and not to men. There is no analytic difference between this kind of discrimination and forms of discrimination that have been already recognized by every court to have addressed them.
For example, discrimination against men who are effeminate rather than macho.
Like the discrimination here, that discrimination is because of non-conformity with an expectation about how men should behave. The attempt to carve out discrimination against men for being gay from Title VII cannot be administered with either consistency or integrity.
In the words of the en banc Second Circuit, it forces judges to result -- resort to lexical bean counting where they count up the frequency of epithets, such as ""fag,"" ""gay,"" ""queer,"" ""real man,"" and ""fem,"" to determine whether or not discrimination is based on sex or sexual orientation. That attempt is futile because when a man is discriminated against for being gay, he is discriminated against for not conforming to an expectation about how men should behave. Finally, the possibility that some employers, but not the employers here, may have policies of denying employment opportunities both to gay men and to lesbians does not change the unlawfulness of what was alleged by the employees here. Labeling those policies under an umbrella phrase like ""sexual orientation discrimination"" cannot hide the fact that such an employer is a double discriminator.

It asks this Court to read the word ""elector"" as agent or, maybe better, minion, and it declares that the votes electors cast are not, as the Constitution expressly describes them, their votes, meaning the electors' votes, but instead are the votes of the state.
Article II in Washington's hands effectively gives the states the power to cast votes for President in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct. But the actual Article II does not give the states the power to cast votes.
It gives the states the power to appoint electors. And the actual electors that the Constitution creates have a legal discretion, as every elector does, not an unfettered discretion, as Washington puts it.
To the contrary, a completely fettered discretion, just fettered by moral and political obligations, not by legal constraint. Washington's alternative to ""vest discretion in citizens rather than electors"" may be a better plan, at least as part of a coherent change, but the question for this Court is not which plan would be better.

By contrast, if a state wishes to treat electors as free agents, rather than as proxy voters, it is free to do so. In short, states determine how to select electors and ensure that they meet the relevant requirements and perform their duties as assigned.
This means, under Green, that states can oversee bribery as an incident as a power to appoint.
This must include the power to remove an elector without requiring a full criminal trial.
Under my friend Mr. Lessig's position, as a practicality, bribed electors would cast ballots and illegal votes. In this case, the State prevented Mr. Baca from casting a legal ballot, just like it's an illegal ballot if you don't sign it here in Colorado. As this Court explained in Ray, the purpose and history of the Twelfth Amendment reflected the reality that electors acted as pledged agents for their political parties.
And the history of such pledges should be given great weight. As to Justice Ginsburg's point about the importance of enforcing a pledge requirement, it's worth noting people rely on such pledges, which are taken voluntarily.
And as Justice Scalia explained in the Inter Tribal Council case, voting requirements would be of little value if not enforced. In the almost 70 years since Ray, states have continued to enact laws to enforce elector pledges.
Congress has consistently deferred to the states' plenary authority, and no court other than the Tenth Circuit below has invalidated a pledge binding law.

We submit that this decision is wrong and should be reversed for at least three reasons. The first is that it is contrary to this Court's decisions, such as Gross and Nassar, holding that but-for causation is the background rule that Congress must have presumed to have been adopted in all federal statutes unless the statute provides otherwise, which we submit Section 1981 does not, either as originally adopted in 1866 or as amended in 1991. Second, in 1991, Congress amended Title VII to provide for a motivating factor standard but did not amend Section 1981 to provide the same, even though it amended Section 1981 in other respects at the same time. This all but conclusively shows that Section 1981 requires but-for causation, as this Court concluded in Gross and Nassar, with respect to the ADEA and the retaliation provisions of Title VII. And, third, it is -- if the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, it would be vastly easier to recover damages under Section 1981's judicially implied cause of action than under any express cause of action actually enacted by Congress under any federal antidiscrimination law.
And, thus, affirming the Ninth Circuit would effectively mean that Section 1981 would completely displace the carefully tailored regime that Congress has devised in Title VII to govern employment discrimination cases.

They are already regulated under several existing state and federal environmental programs, including the Clean Water Act's nonpoint source program. But is a Clean Water Act point source permit also required? The question is where the line falls between the Clean Water Act's federal point source program and its state law nonpoint source program. And the answer is in the text.
The text defines a point source as a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, and it thereby makes clear that the trigger for point source permitting is not where a pollutant comes from but how it reaches navigable waters. An NPDES permit is thus required only when a point source or series of point sources is the means of delivering pollutants to navigable waters.
This understanding is confirmed by the fact that it offers the predictability one would expect in a permitting regime, where regulated entities need to know beforehand whether a permit is required and where, in this particular statute, penalties for noncompliance are so severe. It also maintains an important role for state nonpoint source programs under the Clean Water Act. Respondents, however, would rewrite the statute to all but eviscerate the line between point and nonpoint source pollution and radically change the status quo.
In this case, they would impose a new federal permit on wells that have operated the same way for 40 years, during which time EPA expressly rejected calls for NPDES permitting.
There are more than 500,000 similar underground injection wells in the country and nearly 6,000 in Hawaii alone. This expansion of the nonpoint source program and diminution of the -- excuse me, this expansion of the point source program and diminution of the nonpoint source program is not warranted by the text, as is underscored by the fact that Respondents now offer the fourth different reading of the statute to support liability in this case. Counsel, I -- I want to make sure I understand what your test is.

That decision did not violate the APA for two reasons.
First, it's not subject to judicial review.
The rescission simply ended a previous non-enforcement policy whereby the Department agreed to not enforce the INA against hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens. But the decision whether or not to enforce the law is committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion, unless a statute restricts it.
And nothing in the INA requires the Department, a law enforcement agency, to not enforce the law. Second, the decision to end this non-enforcement policy was eminently reasonable. DACA was a temporary stopgap measure that, on its face, could be rescinded at any time.
And the Department's reasonable concerns about its legality and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies provided more than a reasonable basis for ending it. After all, an agency isn't required to push its legally dubious power to not enforce the law to its logical extreme since it undermines confidence in the rule of law itself and it conflicts with the agency's law enforcement mission. I'd like to begin with the reviewability question.
If the Attorney General were to say that he wasn't going to seek death penalty prosecutions because he thought the death penalty was unconstitutional, that would be immune from judicial review.
And if a new attorney general came in and reversed that policy because he believed that the death penalty was constitutional, that would likewise be immune from judicial review because -- General Francisco, there's a strange element to your argument because you're arguing this is a discretionary matter; it's not reviewable because it's committed to agency discretion.

What it did then was to provide for a three-tiered administrative screening system to first determine whether the alien had a credible fear -- fear of persecution. Respondent contends that the Suspension Clause requires a fact-laden judicial review of the negative fear -- credible-fear determination made in that screening process. Congress, however, while it preserved habeas corpus, tailored it to the special circumstances of expedited removal by limiting it to whether the alien is eligible for expedited removal and whether such an order was entered. Congress's judgment that that approach was necessary for the control of immigration and control of the borders is entitled to great weight and it is consistent with the Suspension Clause. First, Congress has repeatedly said that an alien seeking admission is entitled only to the procedures Congress has provided.
And it has held for more than 100 years that Congress may vest the determination of whether an individual alien is excludable in an executive officer.
Indeed, it said that a determination by such an officer acting within his jurisdiction is due process for purposes of the Constitution.
And when such an order is issued under this system, that expedited removal order establishes the government's right to detain him. A fortiori, that is true when what -- when you have a situation involving an inadmissible alien who seeks review of a negative screening determination for possible relief from removal, notwithstanding his inadmissibility. Mr. Kneedler, it's one thing when an alien comes and has no protected ground to stay here.

This Court should reverse that judgment. Even Respondents now concede that excluding religious schools from the program is unconstitutional, but they argue that the court avoided this discrimination by invalidating the entire program.

The only reason the court invalidated the program was because it included religious schools. And the court's remedy did not cure its discriminatory judgment, nor should the remedy shield the judgment from review. Petitioners brought this lawsuit because they were denied scholarships based on religion, and they are still being denied scholarships based on religion.
If the court had shut down the program because it included Muslim schools or African-American schools, there's no question that would be unconstitutional.
We ask you to reverse. Respondents argue in the alternative that Locke allows them to exclude the religious schools and that this case falls within the play in the joints.
But that would allow the exception to swallow the rule.

It comes down to whether Congress has vested the Board with the executive power of the national government or, instead, vested the Board with the territorial executive power. The statute that created the Board, PROMESA, answers that question in a straightforward way.
It -- it sets up an entity within the territorial government.
It gives the Board only territory-specific authority and instructs the Board to pursue only territory-specific objectives. The Board acts on behalf of Puerto Rico as its representative in judicial proceedings to restructure the territory's debts.
It pursues only Puerto Rico's interests in those proceedings.
It's up to the Article III court that adjudicates those proceedings to balance all the competing interests. Congress also instructed the Board to implement a method for restoring fiscal stability.
That, too, is territorial authority. It reaches only Puerto Rico's budgeting and fiscal planning, and the Board must exercise that authority in a manner that protects Puerto Rico's vital -- vital interests. Now Congress did build in protections to guarantee the Board's independence.
Congress did that because it concluded that Puerto Rico's staggering financial and humanitarian crisis could not be solved unless the Board was insulated from the political pressures that caused that crisis in the first place. But Congress also insulated the Board from federal control.
Board members can be removed only for cause, which means that the President cannot remove them based on disagreement with the Board's policies or priorities in implementing PROMESA.

It is not a comprehensive scheme that displaces all sovereign authority to enforce domestic laws about arbitration agreements. All relevant sources of meaning understand the Convention this same way.
Other contracting states are close to unanimous that the Convention does not preempt domestic law allowing non-signatory enforcement.
The United States, the Restatement, UNCITRAL, and leading commentators agree.
In allowing doctrines like equitable estoppel serves the Convention's overriding purpose, to overcome widespread resistance to arbitration. The Eleventh Circuit nevertheless interpreted the definition of ""agreement in writing"" to preclude non-signatory enforcement. This Court should not make the United States an outlier by adopting that position. Article II(2) just specifies the kinds of agreements that states at a minimum must recognize.
It doesn't limit who can enforce them. Respondents themselves don't defend the Eleventh Circuit's signature-based rule. They concede that all kinds of non-signatory enforcement doctrines, including even some kinds of equitable estoppel, are okay.

Jurisdictional rules need to be clear, but the government does not explain how courts decide whether the Board actually used the correct standard. Our rule is clear.

First, the fortuity of where a victim is standing does not, in fact, trigger any of the special factors counseling hesitation identified by Respondent or the United States. Most importantly, it is difficult to see how foreign relations could be a special factor precluding a Bivens suit here if it wouldn't have precluded a Bivens claim had Sergio been standing just a few feet away. Moreover, the government's assertion that permitting Petitioners' suit would dramatically undermine U.S. foreign relations and diplomacy is belied by the long history of successful tort claims against federal law enforcement officers, including, as in the Apollon, cases in which the victim was a foreigner harmed on foreign soil, the Court awarded damages, and the diplomatic sky did not fall. Nor does extraterritoriality cut against a Bivens remedy here.
Not only was Respondent standing on U.S. soil when he pulled the trigger, but he could not have known in that instant where the bullet would even land, let alone the nationality of anyone it might hit. Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases.

That post-sentencing objection requirement flouts Rule 51, which expressly says that exceptions are not required. Nor is there any practical merit to the Fifth Circuit's rule.
In fact, there's no evidence that a district court has ever reconsidered a sentence in light of a post-sentencing objection.

An amicus tries to defend the judgment below on alternative grounds. According to amicus, a party must identify the length beyond which a sentence is substantively unreasonable. But substantive reasonableness is not a free-standing requirement under the Sentencing Reform Act.
It is simply a standard of appellate review.
And there is no need for parties to frame their claims in terms of that standard of appellate review while they are still in district court, just as they need not frame their objections to evidentiary rulings in terms of abuse of discretion or to factual findings in terms of clear error while they are still in the trial court.

Just four years ago, the Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The Louisiana law at issue here, Act 620, is identical to the Texas law and was expressly modeled on it.

On burdens, it found that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions.
At the same time, it found that Act 620 would do nothing for women's health. In reversing the district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit committed two fundamental errors.
First, it usurped the role of the district court and disregarded nearly all of its factual findings.
Second, the Fifth Circuit accepted legal arguments that this Court rejected four years ago. Nothing, however, has changed that would justify such a legal about-face.
In fact, even more medical organizations have joined the AMA and ACOG to say that admitting privileges impose barriers to abortion with no benefit to patients and that this impact is not state dependent. Finally, the state's eleventh-hour objection to third-party standing runs up against still more binding precedent.
The Court squarely held in Craig versus Boren that such objections are waiveable, and the state deliberately and strategically waived the issue in the district court.
And even if the state could get past waiver, denying standing here would contradict decades of this Court's precedent in numerous areas of the law. In short, Petitioners have third-party standing, especially because Act 620 restricts abortion by regulating them, rather than their patients. Would you have done anything different if it had been -- if the third-party standing had been timely raised? Your Honor, we certainly could have submitted additional evidence in the court, but we believe that the evidence that is already there is sufficient to find third-party standing.

Kansas rewrites history in two ways, first by elevating the wild beast test, one that was never used in this country and only rarely in England, and secondly by conflating common law intent, which required a vicious will and was bound up in moral capacity, with the -- what it applies today, a morality-free modern mens rea. As such, Kansas uproots the deeply rooted by eliminating any mechanism to assess whether a defendant's capacity for moral judgment was intact or was irretrievably compromised by mental illness. Now, I'd like to turn briefly to due process first and explain why the moral capacity notion is and always has been fundamental in our system. The model penal code is an excellent exam -- example.
As criminal law evolved, the drafters moved to more precise mental states. When they did that, though, they retained the compelling mechanism to show insanity.
We could do that, the drafters said, because we kept this, this narrow remnant of common law criminality. In Clark, too, this Court recognized both the presumption of sanity and that evidence of insanity trumps mens rea.
This demonstrates the continued need for a mechanism to rebut the presumption of sanity, even when -- even though a defendant harbors the requisite mental state. And it was not only the mechanism that was important in Clark; the substance was too.
This Court said Arizona could do that, it could eliminate the first part of the M'Naghten test, because it kept this, the right and wrong principle that subsumes it. So I'd like to now turn back to history because it can be -- Well, before you do that, you're relying on due process.

They argue that Congress has, in effect, granted them special immunity because their intent was to obtain employment that Congress has forbidden. This Court never has so held and should not now.
The conflict fatal to the Arizona employment statute is not present here, because Kansas prohibits the theft of personal information by anybody, not work by unauthorized aliens.
And this Court has identified no preempted field relevant here. Section 1324a(b)(5) means what it says and no more.
The I-9 verification system is available only for specified federal uses. (b)(5)'s use limitation, which is quite different from typical preemption provisions, is one of several safeguards Congress adopted in 1986 to limit both governments' and employers' use of the then novel I-9 system. But traditional state criminal law still reaches misconduct elsewhere in the employment context if proven without use of the I-9 system.
For example, states certainly still may prosecute a felon who uses a stolen identity to defeat a background check as a condition of employment at a child care center, even if he also used the same stolen identity on his Form I-9.
So too with the tax withholding forms used here. But isn't it telling, General Schmidt, that in all three cases that we have, the prosecutor initially charged false Social Security number on the I-9, and it was only when the prosecutor appreciated that that couldn't be done that the I-9 charge was deleted?

That common-sense belief that Deputy Mehrer had is one that has been recognized by the judges in 12 state supreme courts, four circuit courts of appeals across the country, and that is that finding the registered owner of the vehicle as a driver is a common-sense inference, absent information to the contrary. Some may argue that the existence of a suspended license would undermine that suspicion, but the, of the 16 courts that I just mentioned, 11 of them have dealt with this precise situation, and the judges of those courts have indicated that reasonable suspicion continues to exist even in that circumstance. Indeed, the factual predicate for the habitual violator law across the country is that the registered owner may be continuing to drive. And the only thing we're asking here is whether or not there's reasonable suspicion to investigate further. Here, Deputy Mehrer relied upon the common-sense understanding that a registered owner, given the pervasiveness of automobile use in the United States, was likely to be driving again, warranted additional investigation.
To borrow a phrase from Terry, it would have been poor police work for Deputy Mehrer not to initiate the stop in this case and investigate further to confirm or dispel his suspicion. At this point, I would invite any questions from the Court.

It would effect a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction into a particularly fraught area. This is not the law.
This Court in Cleveland held that regulatory authority is not property.
So an official who induces a sovereign decision through deceit has not obtained property by fraud.
Only when the official lies to divert state resources to private use has he stepped outside the regulatory realm and committed property fraud. This rule distinguishes property fraud from honest services fraud and from routine political conduct. Here, because the defendants simply reallocated the traffic lanes from one public use to another, the Port Authority at most was deprived of regulatory control, not property. And that's true regardless of whether, as the government now alleges, the defendants lacked the authority in some sense to order the realignment. Mr. Levy will explain why the government is wrong to say that, but it's ultimately legally irrelevant because the fraud statutes do not prohibit lying to take unauthorized state action.
They prohibit lying to obtain property.
And that simply is not what occurred in this case. You've said that if the resources were diverted to private use, then the prosecution would be okay.
But why isn't it a private use to benefit defendants politically? Your Honor, I'm trying to distinguish the use of the property from the motive for the decision.

First, they're authorized by Section 13(a)(4) of the ACA, which requires employers to provide the types of coverage that the Health Resources and Services Administration provides for and supports.
So it authorizes the agencies to require most employers to provide contraceptive coverage while exempting a small number of employers who have sincere conscientious objections. But it doesn't create an all-or-nothing choice: require coverage for everyone or no one.
Otherwise, the long-standing church exemption, the effective exemption for self-insured church plans, and, indeed, Respondents' understanding of the accommodation itself would also violate the statute since the employers' group health plans don't provide the mandated coverage. Second, RFRA at the very least authorizes the religious exemption.
It prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden on religious beliefs subject to a discretionary exception.
It may substantially burden religious beliefs if it can satisfy strict scrutiny. But RFRA doesn't require the government to do that.
Otherwise, the government would have to divine the stingiest accommodations that a court would uphold, virtually guaranteeing a loss in every case. Neither RFRA nor the ACA requires that result. I'd like to begin with the Section 13(a)(4) issue, which requires employers to provide whatever coverage HRSA provides for and supports. General, before you -- And, here, HRSA -- -- before you get to that, I'd like to ask you a question on your RFRA point.
I wonder why it doesn't sweep too broadly.
It is designed to address the concerns about self-certification and what the Little Sisters call the hijacking of their plan. But the RFRA exemption reaches far beyond that.

First, the text, structure, and context of the securities laws offer a straightforward route to reversal.
Congress has created for SEC court actions a tiered system of civil money penalties that does not include disgorgement. Congress has also given the SEC authority for an order requiring accounting and disgorgement, using those very words, in an -- in an administrative proceeding but no similar authority for court actions. And Congress has given other agencies clear textual authority for judicial disgorgement orders.
Using traditional tools of statutory construction, the result is clear: The SEC can seek the authorized penalties but no others. Second, the statute's allowance for equitable relief does not help the SEC because penalties are not equitable relief.
That has been the law for centuries. There is no principal distinction between the characteristics that make SEC disgorgement a penalty under Kokesh and those that make it a penalty under the old equity rule.
Its purpose is to punish disobedience of a public law.
Any return of money or property to those injured by the violation is discretionary at best and often never happens. Third, the phrase ""equitable relief,"" enacted as part of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, did not ratify circuit court cases that had approved SEC disgorgement.
Those cases, beginning with Texas Gulf Sulphur, did not look to statutory text.
They certainly did not settle the meaning of text that did not even exist yet. Instead, we have here only congressional silence, and silence does not give an agency any authority to act, much less the authority to punish.

First, the statute uses a familiar legal phrase with a well-established meaning in the context relevant here.
When courts review judicial orders to determine their impact on a future action, evaluating preclusion, for example, they conclusively presume that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" means dismissed with prejudice.

There's every reason to think Congress expected courts to apply the phrase's settled meaning rather than to convert ordinary without-prejudice dismissals into sanctions that restrict future suits.

There's every reason to think Congress expected courts to apply the phrase's settled meaning rather than to convert ordinary without-prejudice dismissals into sanctions that restrict future suits. Second, the structure of the PLRA further supports that interpretation.
Read together, the three dismissal categories identified in 1915(g) target actions that are facially meritless or otherwise abusive. Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are different.
They may be based on purely procedural defects, such as the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and it would be odd to impose a strike for such suits since Congress excluded from 1915(g)'s reach other categories of dismissals that don't implicate the merits or otherwise suggest abuse, such as dismissals based on sovereign immunity. Third and related, the other side's interpretation upsets the PLRA's balance by punishing prisoners for dismissals that, by definition, say nothing about the ultimate merits of their action.
This interpretation frustrates the Act's objective to filter out bad claims while still allowing for consideration of the good, since it restricts a prisoner's ability to bring a potentially legitimate claim even after the prisoner has cured a procedural defect. I'd like to start with the text of the statute.
The -- the other side's lead argument is that the term ""dismiss"" is sufficiently capacious to encompass both dismissals with prejudice or dismissals without prejudice as a -- as a dictionary matter.

Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free to argue any previously unresolved defense it may have to new claims.
This rule is right for three reasons: First, it follows from this Court's precedent, including Cromwell, Davis, and Taylor. Second, the rule is easy to administer as courts and litigants are accustomed to applying these bedrock principles of issue and claim preclusion. Third, it's fair and protects due process interests. To be clear, we are not arguing that defenses may never be barred under existing law. Issue preclusion could bar a previously resolved defense.
And previously unresolved defenses cannot be raised in the context of a judgment enforcement action or as a claim in an action collaterally attacking a prior judgment. But none of these circumstances are present here.
As the Second Circuit held in the first appeal in this case, Marcel I, Marcel is pursuing new claims as it seeks relief for alleged subsequent infringement.
Thus, this Court should reverse, as the Second Circuit's novel test precluded a never-resolved defense in an action asserting new claims in conflict with settled and sensible principles of claim and issue preclusion. Moreover, the Second Circuit's new test is a bad idea. Before we get to that, Ms. Cendali, could you explain why you abandoned the release defense in the first action?

Simply failing to appropriate the money cancels the obligation. The government's position would also make it impossible to accomplish many important government objectives that require a clear and enforceable promise to pay, as this case well illustrates. When Congress made the health benefit exchanges a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, it faced a problem.
The exchanges depended on the participant of private health insurance companies, and those companies were being asked to insure previously uninsured people on unprecedented terms. The natural reaction of the insurers would have been to charge a substantial premium to account for the uncertainties, but that premium would have worked against the government in two fundamental ways.
First, it would have made the policies relatively unaffordable, contrary to the whole purpose of the Affordable Care Act; and, second, the government would have ended up paying for those heightened premiums through tax subsidies. So the risk corridor programs at issue here was an important component of the government's solution to the problem.
The program depended on a clear and enforceable promise that the government would pay for a portion of any losses incurred by the health insurance companies that stepped forward. In order for that promise to work, it had to be clear and enforceable.
If the government had simply said we will make these risk corridor payments subject to appropriations, the promise would have made no difference whatsoever.

Indeed, Congress considered hallmark language of disestablishment and rejected it.
Congress initially sought cession yet instead provided only for allotment. Then, when congressional inaction would have dissolved the tribe, Congress instead preserved the tribe and its government for all purposes authorized by law, and it did so against the backdrop of existing tribal authority to legislate over reservation land.
Those congressional judgments should be respected. Third, Congress did not transfer criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma.
At statehood, the Major Crimes Act established exclusive federal jurisdiction over enumerated crimes in ""any state of the United States.""

The Arizona Supreme Court then did everything itself just as it had in 1996. That was wrong.
This Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst required a jury sentencing.
If McKinney were sentenced today, no one doubts he'd be entitled to a jury trial. The State claims this would open the floodgates.
But McKinney is not seeking to use Ring retroactively as a sword to challenge his earlier proceedings.
Rather, he's saying that when the State conducts a new proceeding, that sentencing must comply with current law. Otherwise, the implications would be frightening.
For example, a state could run a re-sentencing today in 2019 with a pre-Batson jury, with race-based jury strikes.
That can't be right. And the second path, set out in question 2, is for this Court to simply say that the Eddings violation in this case requires a remand to the trial court for sentencing and that the appellate court was wrong to perform that delicate task itself.
This breaks no new ground.
Indeed, this Court has, on five separate occasions since the 1982 Eddings decision, ordered resentencing for Eddings violations. Both paths get McKinney to the same destination, but they are separate.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction is designed to protect children who have a country of habitual residence from the harmful effects of wrongful removal from that country.
In this case, however, the Convention was applied to separate two-year-old A.M.T. from her mother, the only caregiver A.M.T. had ever known, and to return the child to Italy, a country where A.M.T. had spent only the first eight weeks of her life. The Sixth Circuit's decision upholding A.M.T.'s return to Italy rests on an erroneous definition of habitual residence.
The Sixth Circuit held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent to raise A.M.T. in Italy even if they had no meeting of the minds.
The court never explained how parents can share an intent about where a child will live if there is no actual agreement between them. Tellingly, neither Taglieri nor the United States defends the Sixth Circuit's habitual residence standard.
They instead urge this Court to adopt an amorphous, all relevant circumstances inquiry.
But, in cases involving infants, the foreign jurisdictions on which Taglieri and the United States rely actually apply a different habitual residence standard. That standard focuses on the primary caregiver's connections to the country of removal, a far more appropriate inquiry. Ultimately, however, under any of the competing definitions of habitual residence and standards of review, the outcome of this case is the same.
Eight-week-old A.M.T. was not habitually resident in Italy.
Indeed, the district court's unchallenged finding that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible is virtually dispositive. This Court should put an end to this already four-year-old litigation by entering an order directing A.M.T.'s return to the United States. I'd like to turn first to the definition of habitual residence. The Sixth Circuit applied a shared parental intent standard in name only because it held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent for her to live in Italy even if they had no meeting of the minds or actual agreement -- Mr. Tay -- -- on that issue. -- Tayrani, a -- a problem with your position, I take it your view is this child, taken to the United",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1432, Nasrallah versus Barr. Mr. Hughes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the jurisdiction-stripping provision in (2)(C), it expressly defined the key term ""order of removal."" It is an order that finds an individual deportable or orders deportation. A CAT order does neither, and the government does not disagree.
CAT relief is temporary, applicable only to the country where an individual is likely to be tortured or killed.
If CAT relief is granted, the removal order remains enforceable.
As the government says, ""a grant of withholding or deferral leaves the final order of removal undisturbed."" When Congress enacted (2)(C), it also stripped jurisdiction of expedited removal orders.
This is Section (2)(A), reprinted in the government's brief at page We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1432, Nasrallah versus Barr. Mr. Hughes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the jurisdiction-stripping provision in (2)(C), it expressly defined the key term ""order of removal.""

As the government says, ""a grant of withholding or deferral leaves the final order of removal undisturbed."" When Congress enacted (2)(C), it also stripped jurisdiction of expedited removal orders.
This is Section (2)(A), reprinted in the government's brief at page 4a.
It bars judicial review of ""any individual determination or any other cause or claim arising from or relating to the implementation or operation"" of an expedited order of removal.
That broader language expanded jurisdiction stripping beyond the removal order itself, but Congress did not use that broader language in (2)(C). If none of this carries the day and if some ambiguity remains, the presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative agency action would do the work.
Judicial review of administrative agencies is an essential part of the Constitution's separation of powers. Congress designed CAT relief to be available when all else is stripped away. Congress knowingly rendered those with criminal convictions eligible for protection from likely torture or death.
By its plain terms, 2(C) does not bar review of a CAT claim.
Ultimately, the CAT claim does not qualify as an order of removal. Again, the government doesn't contend that it fits within the clear statutory definition.
And I don't think it can, because the CAT relief comes temporally after in the proceedings the order of removal is entered. Do you agree -- That's both -- -- do you agree that, assuming that review of the -- of BIA fact-finding, assuming that it's available, wouldn't that review be highly deferential to the BIA? Yes, Your Honor, it would be for the substantial evidence review that would govern in circumstances when (2)(C) does not apply.
So I agree there is deference to the BIA.

The State Department had designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993, but Sudan continued to shelter Osama Bin Laden even as he issued fatwahs calling for attacks on U.S. interests. In 1996 Congress enacted the Flatow amendment which, which explicitly provided for punitive damages for acts of state-sponsored terrorism. But still Sudan continued to harbor Al Qaeda. Sudan had ample opportunity to conform its primary conduct to U.S. law.
It just chose not to.
And that's not particularly surprising, because Sudan is a foreign government and foreign governments generally are not guided in their policymaking by changes to U.S. law.
The central rationale underpinning the Landgraf presumption simply is not applicable where the legislation is directed at foreign governments. But, ultimately, this Court need not decide here whether Landgraf or Altmann applies, because the first step in the analysis is to determine whether Congress has clearly defined the statute's temporal reach. And here it is abundantly clear that Congress intended punitive damages be available in two carefully defined categories of cases involving past acts of terrorism. In the subsection entitled, ""Application to Pending Cases,"" Congress set forth two categories of cases, prior actions and related actions, each of which were unmistakably directed at past acts of terrorism. Then the amendments say, in Section 1083(c)(1), ""The amendments made by this section shall apply to any claim arising under Section 1605A."" Congress had said prior -- prior actions and related actions could file under this new 1605A, and now Congress is saying the amendments made by this section shall apply to any of those claims.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If separation of church and state means anything at all, it must mean the government cannot interfere with the church's decisions about who is authorized to teach its religion. In this country, it is emphatically not the province of judges, juries, or government officials to decide who ought to teach Catholic fifth graders that Jesus is the son of God or who ought to teach Jewish preschoolers what it means to say: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one. And at bottom, that is what these cases are about: who controls who teaches the faith to schoolchildren. Under Hosanna-Tabor, the answer is easy.
Churches must choose those who ""teach their faith."" Indeed, that is one of the most important religious functions for any religious community, passing the faith on to the next generation. And since the teachers here were the churches' primary agents for teaching the Catholic faith to fifth graders, teaching them for hours a week, much more than parish priests, they fall within the ministerial exception immunity. Respondents would have the Court ignore all that, substituting a formalistic standard that relies first and foremost on the employees' title to determine whether the ministerial exception applies.
That would wrongly elevate form over function and force judges to decide what titles sound religious enough to qualify, and it would hopelessly entangle church and state.
Unsurprisingly, no court has ever adopted Respondents' title test. If Respondent's arguments give some members of the Court déjà vu all over again, that is because Respondents have recycled many of the arguments the Court unanimously rejected eight years ago in Hosanna-Tabor.
The pretext inquiry, the notice requirement, the idea that freedom of association makes freedom of religion entirely unnecessary all were raised in Hosanna-Tabor and rejected unanimously.
Eight years later, Respondents' arguments are not any more convincing. In short, there's no reason for government to get in the business of teaching religion.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An unsuccessful patent applicant may seek judicial review through either a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141 or a district court suit under Section 145. Section 145 states that an applicant who files suit under that provision must pay all the expenses of the proceeding. The question presented here is whether those expenses include money that the PTO spends to employ lawyers and paralegals who assist with the agency's defense of the suit. For three principal reasons, the answer to that question is yes.
First, the term ""expenses"" unambiguously encompasses costs -- encompasses money paid to employees or other personnel to accomplish an -- a particular task. And unlike the term ""costs,"" which has a similarly broad common meaning, this Court has not construed the term ""expenses"" as a legal term of art with a more limited scope. Second, requiring patent applicants who file suit under Section 145 to pay personnel expenses of the PTO is consistent with the overall statutory scheme.
Congress has directed the PTO to charge fees that are sufficient to cover its aggregate operating costs, including personnel expenses. And the PTO has developed fee schedules that, in a rough and ready way, require applicants who cause the agency to incur greater expenses to -- to pay more in the way of fees.
And Section 145 applicants put the PTO to a particular expenses, and it's therefore consistent with the logic of the statute to require them to pay more. And, third, it's especially appropriate to require Section 145 plaintiffs to pay the PTO's personnel expenses because Section 141 is available as an alternative means of obtaining judicial review.
Section 141 is not a cut-rate or a substandard mode of judicial review.
It's ordinary, on the record, APA-style judicial review.

It can't be that Ann Hopkins would lose her case on the same facts were she transgender. Second, Harris Homes fired her for identifying as a woman only because she was assigned a male sex at birth.
In doing so, it fired her for contravening a sex-specific expectation that applies only to people assigned male sex at birth; namely, that they live and identify as a man for their entire lives.
That is disparate treatment on the basis of sex. Third, Harris Homes fired her for, in its owner's words, changing her sex.
That's discrimination in the same way that firing someone for changing their religion would be religious discrimination. That Harris Homes would fire both transgender men for being insufficiently feminine and transgender women for being insufficiently masculine is, as the government concedes, two acts of sex discrimination, not a defense. None of these arguments ask this Court to redefine or, in Judge Posner's words, update sex.

The state's only defense in -- in support of the judgment below is that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity at all; that is, not in state courts or in federal courts. This Court should reject that argument.
As the Court has said many times over many decades, the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict to convict.
In particular, what the Court has said is that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury carries with it the essentials of the common law. And the common law authorities are uniform, explicit, and absolute.
Unanimity is an absolute requirement to trial by jury.
And the reasons that the common law commentators gave for that rule are the -- are -- resonate just as powerfully now as they did then.
In a nutshell, we are not prepared to take away someone's liberty unless a cross-section of the community uniformly agrees that criminal punishment is appropriate. Now, I don't think the state disputes that historical account that I just gave you or even that unanimity is central to the proper functioning of the jury trial right.
Instead, what the state says are two primary things: First, that the drafting history of the Sixth Amendment suggests that the framers meant to dispense with that historical rule, and, second, that that historical requirement of unanimity is no more important than the 12-person rule, which this Court said is not part of the Sixth Amendment, in Williams.

As this Court determined just four terms ago in Bullard versus Blue Hills Bank, the fact that an order disposes of a proceeding is not, despite what -- despite what Respondent and the government contends, the test for determining finality.
That, in the words of the Court, slices the case too thin. Rather, an immediately appealable order is determined by considering the larger process at issue and whether the order is final by examining whether it alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties. In Bullard, the relevant process was the plan confirmation process.
Here, the relevant process is the claims adjudication or the claims allowance process under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code. As in Bullard, the order here did not resolve the larger process.
It did not alter the status quo, nor did it fix the obligations of the parties.
On the contrary, it simply continued the automatic stay so the underlying claim would proceed in bankruptcy court. In arguing otherwise, Respondent and the government badly misperceived the role of the automatic stay in bankruptcy cases. The automatic stay is not itself one of the substantive processes of bankruptcy.
It is a utility provision that supports the operation of these other processes.
In fact, it was Jackson who argued that Ritzen's motion for relief triggered the claims adjudication process, claiming the stay motion constituted an informal proof of claim. Such an order changes little and, in the words of this Court, does not alter the status quo or fix the rights and obligations of the parties.

The FDIC takes a different approach, although exactly what that approach is has changed somewhat over the course of this litigation.
In the lower courts, the FDIC advocated a rule of federal common law known as the Bob Richards rule, which holds that ownership of a tax refund presumptively resides with the subsidiary whose losses gave rise to that refund.
That's the rule the FDIC has advocated for decades, and that's the rule the Tenth Circuit applied below. But, in this Court, the government has abandoned any defense of the Bob Richards rule, and as our opening brief explains, that rule fails every test this Court has established for the creation of federal common law and contravenes the tax laws themselves. Instead, the government advocates a brand-new rule, one that it's never pressed in the lower courts, and that, to our knowledge, no court has ever adopted.
But this rule suffers from an even more basic flaw than Bob Richards itself.
It simply assumes the answer to the very ownership question at issue. The government's argument starts from the premise that where a parent has agreed to pay its subsidiary the amount of a tax refund, the subsidiary has been vested with ""ultimate entitlement to the refund itself."" That assumption serves as the load-bearing pillar of the government's entire argument.

The statutory text and structure supersede any settled willfulness requirement. And, third, there was no such settled background willfulness requirement. First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" refers to the familiar equitable principles that courts have long applied in determining whether to award profits in trademark cases.
A defendant's culpability is a weighty factor, but it should not be controlling.
Other traditional equitable factors are also important to further the landmark -- the Lanham Act's purposes to protect consumers and trademark owners' goodwill. Such traditional factors include whether other relief adequately compensates the plaintiff and whether the defendant is enriched by his violation of law. And these factors can all exist along a spectrum.
For instance, culpability can range from fraudulent to innocent and everything in between, including callous disregard and negligence.
So in a case where a defendant is completely innocent, courts should require a greater showing of other factors before awarding profits. Conversely, greater culpability justifies a profit award that deters future infringement.
And courts can be trusted to use their discretion to balance the equities for the cases in between.
The statute also requires the amount of any award to be compensatory and not a penalty, and just, according to the circumstances. Second, even assuming a settled willfulness requirement before the Lanham Act, the statutory text and structure reflect a congressional intent to supersede it.

The Court can provide complete relief by invalidating the Civil Investigative Demand and reversing the judgment below. In any event, the text and context of the Dodd-Frank Act make clear that Congress wanted to create an agency that was independent to the fullest extent possible and not to vest vast power in an agency that was subject to presidential control without any congressional control over its funding. The government's proposed remedy would have the perverse effect of making the CFPB less independent than agencies it was replacing. The Court should leave to Congress the quintessentially legislative task of deciding how to fix the CFPB's defective structure. Mr. Shanmugam, this case has kind of an academic quality to it.

Florida's law is an aberration. The question here is whether Congress intended convictions under such an aberrational law to support the extreme sentencing enhancement of up to life in prison under ACCA. The answer is no for a variety of reasons. First, the state offense provision presents a list of generic crimes which all include a mens rea element. Second, the text of the state offense provision itself implies a mens rea element irrespective of any generic offense analysis. Third, Congress described the qualifying state offenses by tracking almost verbatim the language of the federal drug trafficking statute.
Congress used the same terms and even in the same order as the federal statute.
We know that when Congress transplants language from one legal source to another, the language carries the old soil with it.
And here the old soil includes a mens rea element. While tracking the federal statute, Congress used the term ""involving"" to sweep in similar crimes described with different terminology, such as promoting, producing, or furnishing a controlled substance.
And Florida uses the term ""sale,"" which we agree comes under the umbrella of the term -- the federal term, ""distribution."" Finally, since Congress legislates against the background of the common law even in the sentencing context, the requirement for prior convictions for felony offenses itself carries a presumption of mens rea for all the serious drug offenses, federal and state, and shows moreover that the state predicate provision is offense-driven and not based upon discrete conduct or activities. That's a summary of our argument, but I can be more specific.
Here we have a phrase ""manufacturing, distribution, possession with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance."" This phrase incorporates well-known drug trafficking crimes under the federal code.

Mr. Stris. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My clients are beneficiaries of a pension trust.
We allege that the trustees, through disloyalty and imprudence, caused the trust to lose $750 million.
The suit presents a justiciable case or controversy for three reasons: First, my clients have an equitable interest in all assets of their pension trust. That is a property interest.
And when $750 million of that property was lost, my clients suffered a concrete injury. Respondents are between a rock and a hard place.
They can't argue that participants have an equitable interest in only some of the trust corpus, because the trust is unsegregated and undivided.
So they're forced to take the incredible position, to quote their brief, that defined-benefit plan participants have no interest in plan assets. If Respondents were right, no one would have an equitable interest in any of the trust's assets.
But a trust can't exist unless someone holds equitable title to its assets, and that someone here can only be the participants. Second, and independently, my clients have a right to loyal stewardship of their retirement savings.
When Respondents engaged in self-dealing, my clients suffered a concrete injury.
Under the centuries-old ""no further inquiry"" rule, beneficiaries could sue even when there was no conceivable possibility of a financial loss.
The breach itself gives rise to a case or controversy. In any event, and third, my clients have representational standing to vindicate injury to their plan.
Since before the founding, when a trustee was unwilling to sue, equity courts allowed beneficiaries to do so on behalf of the trust. And so I'd like to begin with our property injury.
A defined-benefit plan under ERISA is a private exchange of services. Workers forgo wages in exchange for a promise of a future payment secured by trust property. This is critical because there is an unsegregated, undivided pool of assets, the trust, that pays the pension of all the beneficiaries.
So plan participants, like my clients, have an equitable interest in those assets. Does your argument depend upon a forward-looking theory of injury? In other words, it's -- if -- it's one thing to have a -- a conflict of interest or all the",0.0

Congress could have written Section 314(d) to review only the determination whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the petition -- petitioner would prevail, but Congress wrote the provision more broadly to apply to the institution decision as a whole. Further, Section 314 itself instructs the director to look beyond that section in making the institution determination in at least two ways.
First, subsection (b) instructs the director to ""determine whether to institute an inter partes review under this chapter."" And more expressly, subsection (a) tells the director to consider the patent owner's response in determining whether to institute review.
And Section 313 says the patent owner in that response can present reasons explaining why the petition fails to meet any requirements of the chapter. In other words, the text of the statute makes clear that the institution determination occurs under Section 314 based on the prerequisites in the entire chapter.
And because subsection (d) provides the institution determination cannot be judicially reviewed, the agency's application of those prerequisites located elsewhere in the chapter cannot be appealed, including Section 315(b). Now the statutory history confirms this reading.
Congress knew how to limit the appeal bar just to the preliminary patentability determination.
That is, after all, how it wrote the similar -- the analogous limits on judicial review for ex parte reexaminations in former Section 312 and inter partes reexaminations in Section 313. The inter partes reexamination statute, former 312, although now repealed, is particularly instructive.
Like with IPRs, Congress included several prerequisites to institution in former Section 311.

It has long been understood that because Congress's subpoena power is implied, it is auxiliary and subordinate.
And when that power is deployed against the President, it must yield absent any long-standing tradition or particularly compelling showing of need.
The committees can satisfy neither condition here, and that should decide this case. The committees contend that these subpoenas satisfy the limits this Court has always applied to congressional subpoenas.
But their arguments would render those limits meaningless.
For example, they contend that this Court should ignore the committees' avowed improper purpose so long as they simply tack on a broad reference to potential legislation. They claim that Congress can use subpoenas to uncover individual wrongdoing simply because that will always inform the sufficiency of existing laws.
And they challenge this Court's ability to even question the constitutionality of the potential legislation that they rely upon. The committees' obvious overreach is sufficient to invalidate these subpoenas even in a typical case.
But the Court simply does not proceed against the President as it does against an ordinary individual.
The committees have not even tried to show any critical legislative need for the documents these subpoenas seek. Now it is no secret the relationship between the House of Representatives and the President is frayed, but this is neither the first nor the last time that one House of Congress will be at odds with the President.

It subjects the President to local prejudice that can influence prosecutorial decisions and to state grand juries, who can then be utilized to issue compulsory criminal process in the form of subpoenas targeting the President. This is not mere speculation.
It is precisely what has taken place in this case and with the subpoena we challenge.
In the argument just concluded, we asserted that the subpoenas did not serve a legitimate legislative purpose and they were burdensome.
Yet, the DA copied almost verbatim the House Oversight Committee's subpoena, with an additional 13 words, which seek the President's tax returns. How revealing.
The exact same language utilized by two congressional committees would subsequently be copied by the New York County district attorney covering the exact same documents and sent to the exact same recipients yet purportedly for two completely different reasons. Under Article II or the heightened scrutiny standard under Nixon, the subpoena we challenge today cannot survive.

This, he cannot do. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, for all that, you don't argue that the grand jury cannot investigate the President, do you?

In other words, secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness is simply irrelevant to generic terms.
That principle controls here. It is undisputed that ""booking"" is generic for the hotel reservation services Respondent provides.
Respondent thus could not federally register ""Booking."" Nor could Respondent register ""Booking Company"" or ""Booking Inc."" In Goodyear, this Court held that the mere addition of an entity designation like ""Company"" or ""Inc."" to an unprotectable term does not create a protectable mark.
That is because those terms indicate only that parties have formed an association or partnership to deal in the relevant goods.
By prohibiting a first adopter from obtaining a trademark in a phrase like ""Booking Inc.,"" Goodyear ensured that no party can monopolize a generic term. The same result should apply to Booking.com.
The addition of "".com"" is the on-line equivalent of ""Company"" or ""Inc."" It conveys only that Respondent provides its services via a commercial website on the Internet.
There is no sound reason for Respondent to be able to federally register ""Booking.com"" as a trademark when it couldn't register ""Booking, Inc."" Registration would effectively give Respondent a monopoly on the words ""Booking.com"" and would interfere with competitors' ability to use similar domain names.
That's particularly problematic because it's how the Internet works. Only one entity can obtain the contractual rights to a domain name at a time.
So Respondent already enjoys significant competitive advantages that brick-and-mortar equivalents like ""Booking Inc."" would lack. That same feature of the Internet also means that if Respondent's survey evidence is enough to obtain federal trademark registration, that nearly every generic.com business can do the same.

Since reauthorized three times, the Act has committed nearly 80 billion dollars to global AIDS relief, and it has worked, saving more than 17 million lives in the most successful American foreign aid effort since the Marshall Plan. The funding condition at issue here requires recipients to have a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, which Congress found are coercive practices that spread HIV/AIDS and degrade women and girls.
This Court held that applying that condition to Respondents' domestic entities violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.
But Respondents sought more, and the question now is whether the condition can still be applied to foreign grant recipients operating abroad. It can for two straightforward reasons.
Foreign entities lack constitutional rights, so they cannot bring an unconstitutional conditions claim, and neither can Respondents because they are not subject to the funding condition.
Thanks to their victory in this Court, Respondents can accept and use funds without any compelled speech.
To be sure, Respondents can choose to affiliate with foreign entities that must comply with the policy condition, but any effect on Respondents' message is now a product of their own choice, not government compulsion. Respondents' contrary view is startling.
They would allow U.S. non-profits to export constitutional rights to legally separate foreign entities abroad simply because they share similar brands.
That novel theory has no basis in this Court's prior decision, it could undermine long-standing regulations of foreign speech, and it has no practical justification. For 17 years, foreign recipients have adhered to the policy condition without harming the AIDS relief program or Respondents' speech. This Court afforded Respondents all the relief they deserve.

You don't call the nine Park Service employees at Harpers Ferry and ask them to come out and fix the tree. Respondents' theory is inconsistent with the Act and would dramatically change the national trail system.
Respondents, for instance, argue that the trail is land and it's administered by the Park Service.
So their position is that the entire trail is federally administered -- a federally administered area of land. But if you look at page 14a, this is Section 1246(h)(1), it requires that the Secretary shall encourage states to operate, develop, and maintain portions of such trails -- and this is scenic trails -- located outside the boundaries of federally-administrated areas.

Predecessors to this statute have been on the books since the late 19th Century, and this provision has existed in substantially its current form for decades. Yet, Respondent and her amici have identified no actual instances in which the statute has been applied to protected First Amendment activity or any concrete documented instances of chilling speech. The absence of such evidence isn't just happenstance, and it doesn't just reflect long-standing executive self-restraint.
It's because the statute isn't aimed at speech, and it certainly doesn't encompass substantial amounts of it. To the extent that it could be applied to protected speech, that can be handled through the normal mechanism of as-applied First Amendment challenges in those cases.
