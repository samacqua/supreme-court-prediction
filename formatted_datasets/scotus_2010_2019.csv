"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-877, Allen versus Cooper. Mr. Shaffer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When states infringe the exclusive federal rights that Congress is charged with securing, Congress can make states pay for doing so.
That's our respectful submission today, one that follows from the Constitution's text and affords ample basis for this Court to uphold the work Congress did in enacting the CRCA. Article I, Section 8, clause 8, what we're calling the intellectual property clause, is unique within Article I in laying down an express constitutional mandate for Congress to protect specified private property rights against any and all intrusion. Consider just how pointed and clear the constitutional text is.
Congress is not only to be granting copyrights but securing them, and the resulting rights by definition are meant to be exclusive rights.
Exclusive against whom, Your Honors? Exclusive against all comers, exclusive against the world, including the government and including states. And this exercise of congressional power serves the express constitutional purpose to promote progress.
How? By affording monetary recompense to copyright holders.
The framers thus made very clear that all those wanting to use an author's copyright are meant to be paying money for doing so. This clause's text signals a plan of the convention waiver like no other in Article I.
For states to retain immunity to avoid paying for infringing the very same exclusive rights that Congress is meant to secure would be incompatible with the text as fixed and understood by the framers. And this Court has already so recognized in substance.
Going back to 1888, in United States v. Palmer, the Court said in holding the federal government monetarily liable for infringing patents that Congress's power, the same power we were just talking about, could not be affected if the government had a reserve right to infringe.
Same reasoning holds for states, Your Honors. And in Goldstein v. California in 1973, the Court said -- and, again, in -- here discussing copyrights -- when Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its effects are pervasive.
No citizen or state may escape its reach. All -- all that is -- would be highly persuasive if we didn't have the patent decision, the Florida Prepaid decision.
It is the very same clause.
It's the very same secure.
It's the very same exclusivity. Correct, Justice Ginsburg.
But -- but the Court was not examining the text.
The Court was not examining the clause.
In fact, it didn't even grant review on the question whether the Article I basis for the Patent Remedy Act would be a valid basis.
That wasn't before the Court.
It wasn't even raised before the Court. And so all the Court did, Justice Ginsburg, was refer back to Seminole Tribe, that the sweeping assumption of Seminole Tribe that no Article I clause could ever supply a basis for abrogation.
That's the same assumption that the Court in Katz more recently called dicta and held to be erroneous dicta, an erroneous assumption, which is the only way that the Court was able to analyze the is at page 363 of Katz -- it says, ""our assumptions about the Bankruptcy Clause were erroneous."" And I think that that was a reasonable thing for Congress -- for this Court to say, given that there had been nearly a century of precedent, going all the way back to 1933 in New York versus Irving Trust, saying that bankruptcy discharge proceedings -- You said the blanket statement in Seminole Tribe was incorrect and Florida Prepaid relied on that same blanket statement in Seminole Tribe.
It seems to be a problem for that blanket statement in Florida Prepaid. Yes, I -- I completely agree.
I think that the reasoning of Florida Prepaid's Article I holding has been undercut and that would be a reason to revisit -- It's two sentences. That's correct, Your Honor. It's very limited.
And it's based on a principle that has been undermined by Katz.
I think -- so you would apply the ordinary rules of stare decisis.
That's the only point here. Not that it has not been undermined in any respect. And I think if you view this question in terms of the principles that stare decisis is supposed to uphold, you know, legal stability, reliance on this Court's decisions, that that would really bring this issue into focus, because everyone who has evaluated Florida Prepaid and whose job it is to evaluate this Court's rulings and say what are my legal rights and obligations has said that it covers both the Copyright Remedy Act and the Patent Remedy Act, including the United States Government, which has -- I just -- I really don't follow your reliance argument.
Yes, the state may be relying, but who other than the state relies on the state's right to infringe without damage liability, who other than the state? I -- I think that I am speaking about the state's reliance interests, for the states generally.
And I think here is why that matters, and I would bring it back to this case. So the -- our Cultural Resources Department is operating on a shoestring budget trying to recover and excavate and preserve the remaining aspects of the Queen Anne's revenge, around 40 percent of which under their estimates is still on the bottom of the ocean. And they are doing that work.
And it's when there are competing legislative priorities, such as school funding and disaster relief, and all sorts of other more important priorities, it's hard to get money to fund important work like this for the state's history. I think, though, Mr. Park, what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, that it's not the strongest reliance argument to say we relied on this -- this Court's holding to infringe other people's rights. Not -- not to infringe on other people's rights.
I think that what they did here is that they posted online on good faith -- faith reliance on a contract.
It could have also been on fair -- on good-faith reliance and perhaps an aggressive reading of fair use in other situations, but they did that because they thought that they wouldn't have infringement liability of up to $150,000 per work. And there are -- you know, I can give legions of examples where juries have awarded astronomical copyright damages.
There was a jury in Minnesota that awarded $1.9 million against a single mother of four for downloading and sharing a few copyrighted images online, and the Eighth Circuit reduced that judgment to $220,000.
She still went bankrupt. But because these issues are ordinarily thought to be a due process problem on the other side, and so I think that you would see states retract from their uses of copyrighted works in a way that benefit the public. There is an amicus brief from the library association saying that this would imperil -- copyright infringement liability, monetary liability, would imperil digitization projects and other works of archives. And I think the states are simply different.
I -- I don't think it's respectful to the interests of state governments to say -- You can finish the sentence. -- that they will -- that they will infringe at will if damages liability is taken off the table. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Park. Four minutes, Mr. Shaffer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Starting with Blackbeard's law, Justice Sotomayor, I want to be clear, Blackbeard's law was passed after the allegations of infringement in -- in this case, after North Carolina had been caught infringing. It was then used, as -- as alleged in the complaint, by North Carolina to defend against the state court suit by Intersal because they said Blackbeard's law had voided the settlement agreement. It was now contrary to North Carolina's public policy and they couldn't be held to the settlement agreement, nor could they be held liable.
That's in the complaint.
That is as alleged, and I don't think there's any ability by the State in this posture to contradict those allegations. As to the Intersal dispute that Mr. Park talks about, in North Carolina State Court, Intersal does not hold the copyrights, so they're sued by definition.
It's not trying to vindicate the copyrights. That suit was just decided by the North Carolina Supreme Court after North Carolina for years interposed sovereign immunity defenses saying that the breach of contract action had not been properly filed administratively, there needed to be administrative exhaustion.
So that suit is continuing on.
It's not as though sovereign immunity was no impediment, and it's certainly not out to vindicate copyrights. As to the images in question, I just have to emphasize, Your Honor, my clients have put in two decades of work, essentially, trying to be there to ex- -- when these images are excavated underwater, at great expense, at great risk, and this is all essentially my clients get out of it, the copyrighted images. And the allegations of the complaint are that North Carolina, not once or twice but repeatedly and systematically, was infringing those copyrights, was caught doing it, paid $15,000 under the terms of the settlement agreement, went back to doing it.
Even after this complaint was filed, they continued to infringe the copyrights.
And the resolution by the Fourth Circuit is everything is dismissed. And as to injunctive relief, Justice Breyer, Congress found it provides no meaningful remedy in this context, different from the patent context, but it's all about getting paid for past damages in order for this to be a meaningful remedy. And in this case, the request for injunctive relief was thrown out.
Why? Because North Carolina did exactly what you articulated, Justice Breyer.
They said: Well, we've stopped infringing those images now that you've pointed it out in court.
We've taken those down.
What else have you got? And without benefit of discovery, the Fourth Circuit viewed that as the end of the request for injunctive relief.
And that's how it goes in copyright cases. Now, as to the notion that there could be individual suits against individual officers under 1983, you're exactly right, Chief Justice, qualified immunity is a defense in this context. I'd commend to the Court the Fourth Circuit's decision on this point.
It's at 37a, 39a.
They basically said, because there's some defense that's available to these officials, they say they read the settlement agreement differently, maybe they didn't know it was copyright infringement, maybe they weren't looking for the watermarks or the -- the time stamps, that is a good enough defense.
Qualified immunity gets them out of the case, and those claims, too, were dismissed. That's why it's so important, part of why it's so important, in copyright cases that there be secure remedies for copyright holders. That's true against states and it's true against anyone.
Most copyright holders, unlike patent holders, Justice Alito, these are small fish, they have not sunk costs into this sort of a registration. And they need to have secure statutory damages and attorneys' fees in order to come to court at all because, in copyright cases, as Congress found from the testimony before it and the -- and the submissions of the register, you need to have statutory damages.
Otherwise, how can you quantify what the harm was? And especially given how small the stakes are in copyright cases and how under-heeled most copyright plaintiffs are, if you don't have those statutory damages, you don't have a right.
And that is specifically found by Congress in the House report at pages 9 and 10. So, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked about what happens in ordinary cases.
This is exactly what Congress looked at.
They said the rule in copyright cases, absent the CRCA, is that copyright infringement pays for states.
They will get away with it every time.
You will not have copyright holders who have incentives and means and attorneys to bring suit.
That should not be the outcome in this case. And to say it, respectfully, that it's incumbent upon every copyright plaintiff who sues a state to prove a constitutional violation and willfulness in the way that Mr. Park articulates is to render the right nugatory and the CRCA as well. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1498, Atlantic Richfield versus Christian. Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves whether the hundreds of thousands of landowners on Superfund sites can bring state lawsuits to implement their own piecemeal hazardous waste cleanups. The answer should be no. CERCLA entrusts EPA to protect human health and the environment by developing a remedial plan that protects the whole community. Respondents are profoundly wrong that removing waste is always better than leaving it in place. Superfund sites contain extremely hazardous substances, lead, mercury, plutonium, to name a few.
Excavation, transportation, and disposal of these substances is risky not only to neighbors but the millions of people who live next door to Superfund sites.
Whether these risks are worth any benefits should be evaluated by EPA, not juries on an ad hoc basis. Since 2013, EPA has objected that Respondents' restoration remedy would thwart more than three decades of efforts -- of its efforts at the Anaconda site, including by digging up soil that EPA wants left undisturbed and by building miles of underground trenches that would affect an entire community's groundwater. This Court should reverse for three reasons.
First, Section 113 bars Respondents' challenge to EPA's remedy. Second, Section 122 bars Respondents from undertaking any remedial actions absent EPA's authorization. And, third, a restoration remedy is preempted because it would require Atlantic Richfield to effectuate the very cleanup that federal law prohibits the company from doing on its own, and a restoration remedy would prevent EPA from carrying out its statutory mandate to implement comprehensive cleanups. Ms. Blatt, I've been trying to unpackage this case in my own mind, and I start with the language of the statute.
I'm sorry.
I interrupted you. Finish. No, we're good. Okay. (Laughter.) I'm sorry. No. I am trying to figure out -- let's assume for the sake of argument that the remedial plan that the state court orders supplements, rather than contradicts, the EPA plan, that it was something in top of. I read the savings clauses to permit that.
It -- the savings clauses are very explicit that it's not displacing or intending to displace state law remedies for liability or for anything else. So, if these plans supplement, why would this part of Montana law be preempted? So, in terms of preemption, so it's quite emphatic to understand that Section 122(e)(6) and the over 20 administrative orders impose both a floor and a ceiling on the type of cleanup -- If I disagree that it's a ceiling -- Well -- -- if I think it's just a flaw -- a floor -- Sure. -- and that the EPA has the power to decide whether any plan can supplement its own -- Of course. -- where does that leave this argument? So you -- If -- if -- if -- if I believe -- Sure. -- that it's a -- it's a floor only, not a ceiling -- Uh-huh. -- that the EPA has the right Gorsuch's question really just turns on who has the burden? Under your theory, EPA has the burden to initiate proceedings; under the other side's argument, the landowner has the burden to go to EPA first? Is that an accurate way of looking at it? That is, Your Honor.
So they -- the presumption is we are private property owners, that we have control of our own property, and we can remove arsenic on our own property if we want to.
Nothing in their 122(e)(6) argument -- The question is whether CERCLA displaces that presumption. Whether CERCLA displaces that forever -- Right. Right? A thousand years from now, under their view, we would -- if we wanted to remove a shovelful -- But either -- -- of dirt -- -- way -- sorry to interrupt.
Either way, EPA would have the say. It's just whether EPA initiates or you go to EPA.
I think you just said that. Yeah, but I think the default rule is critical, right? I mean, we have the bundle of property rights -- Yeah. -- and if we, you know, commit an environmental offense, then EPA as a regulator can use its power -- What would the -- -- to go after us. -- government have to show? What's the -- what would -- what would the test be? What would the legal standard be? If -- if they went after us, it would be a violation of -- of CERCLA. These are the -- this is what -- and the government itself took the position that those tools are fully adequate here to protect the integrity of the remedy. These things are likely to be pretty complicated.
And if we -- one way, it's central, everyone goes to EPA, and there's a central review in court. The other way, you want EPA to go to any place where a landowner has a law in -- in his favor that lets him do some things, and EPA is going to have to prove that this particular thing in each of these cases is a CERCLA violation, which is already a standard that's -- it might not, it might just be an interference with their plan.
It might just be raising the cost of their plan.
It might be who knows.
I'm not an expert in this. But that's -- that's the question: How did Congress want this to work? Right.
And one can imagine Congress writing a statute to give EPA complete control, but it didn't -- it didn't do that. And it might have used the words potentially responsible person has to go to EPA and, by that, meant that those people who live or own property on a toxic waste center.
That's what they argue. Right, Your Honor, their position is that every single private property landowner -- Yeah. -- in this vast 300-square-mile Superfund site has to get their permission to remove even a shovelful of dirt from their own backyard. No, I don't know that they -- Well, but that's the reason, though -- That is page 34 of the Blue Brief.
ARCO says remedial action covers virtually any physical action with respect to hazardous waste at the site, including storage, excavation.
It has a list there.
It's virtually anything. They're saying that our -- my clients in Opportunity, Montana, have to get permission from EPA in Washington if they want to dig out part of their backyard to put in a sandbox for their grandchildren and -- And are you saying also it's an -- Well, you can say dig out -- you can say dig out part of their backyard.
EPA would say if you want to disturb arsenic-infected land, dirt in a way that would not only harm your neighbors but could harm people many -- many miles away.
I mean, yes, you want to just do things -- And if -- -- on your land, but you can't overlook the fact that that is going to have harmful effects on everybody else around you. And if you assume that harm that's assumed, embedded, in your question, they have the tools to go after that.
What I'm talking about is when there's no showing of harm.
Their argument is whether there's harm or not, we have to get their permission. And if I can -- I guess the -- Just -- -- question, though, is -- and, you know, you might say, look, this is a policy matter and Congress decided it.
But I guess the question is it -- it's hard for EPA to go around and try to figure out who's creating sandboxes.
And so why should the onus be on EPA to figure out who's creating sandboxes? Well, EPA is, of course, all over this site, and it can enforce the law here.
The question is whether we are -- should be similarly situated to just you and me and any American who, if we violate the law, the regulator, the law enforcement, can come after us, or whether we have this kind of superintending presence of agency authority over us and our private property for the rest of our lives.
And that's not what -- that's not the scheme that Congress created.
It went out of its way to allow state law over these traditionally state law subjects to continue. But your -- your -- your parade of horribles can still come true with EPA being aggressive in getting to all those places.
So really the question that -- If -- if they want to come out -- you're right. -- the question Justice Breyer asked is does it make sense to have you go to EPA first so that they can maintain control? ""Comprehensive"" is the word in the statute after all. Your Honor, there's no evidence that Congress intended this obscure corner of Section 122 about settlements to give EPA that kind of vast control forever over private property. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Sotomayor, I answered one of your questions incorrectly on a cite, and I -- I need to correct it.
Section 107(q)(1)(A) 3 through 5 is the contiguous landowner provision that says if you live on a Superfund site, no matter what, you have to make sure you comply and not interfere with EPA. So there's provisions throughout CERCLA that say no matter what your defenses may be, you always are on the hook to not do anything to interfere with EPA's remedy.
And I just gave you different cites. So, on PRPs, in terms of this is a status and not a financial liability, EPA, they're always liable under 106 for abatement. And they're always liable in a suit by Atlantic Richfield when the cleanup ends under Section 113(g)(2)(A).
We might not get much money, but they're -- they're definitely on the hook. But the real question is one of status.
And it's -- Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, you were wrong on this as being a question of who has to sue and a burden.
EPA would have no way of knowing what -- they only know in this case and wrote them a letter because there's a lawsuit and a Supreme Court case in the state of Montana, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who live on -- live on Superfund sites with uranium and God knows what else, and how is EPA exactly supposed to know when someone is removing uranium? It has a half-life of 4.7 billion years. Arsenic has no half-life.
It always is there.
It cannot be destroyed.
It doesn't evaporate.
So, yeah, they have some restrictions before they move hazardous waste. The other thing is in terms of who you'd have to sue, I would freak out if I got a -- a -- a letter.
Their view is you have to sue these poor innocent landowners and say you're liable under CERCLA.
Just so you know, that's the only way we can keep control of the site. That's the only way we're going to know and then, you know, now they're on notice because, otherwise, you would have this metaphysical thing of who knows who's liable? In terms of the taking issue, and I think that Justice -- I mean, you guys already answered this, but this is really a question of do you have to go to EPA.
If EPA denies permission and they want to bring a takings claim, go sue EPA. There's also a citizen suit provision that in 2025, they can bring a lawsuit and say: EPA, your remedy was terrible, we don't like it, it violated CERCLA, come up with a new one. That -- that's what the citizen suit provision is before -- for. On the mouse hole point, I don't think it's a mouse hole.
So it has mouses or elephants, I guess, all the way in the statute. There are provision after provision in the contiguous landowner, in the demicrominimus -- or whatever that word is -- in the bona fide landowner that says at all times you have to make sure you don't interfere with EPA's remedy. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-882, Babb versus Wilkie. Mr. Martinez. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 633a states that all federal personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.
Both parties agree that that language tracks the text and meaning of Title VII's identical federal sector provision covering race, sex, and religion. Together the two provisions bar discrimination not only in the ultimate outcome of a personnel decision but also in the process of making that decision.
That's true regardless of whether the prohibited characteristic at issue is a but-for cause of the final decision. That's the rule that the MSPB and the EEOC have applied in countless cases for many years, but more importantly it flows directly from the statutory text. The phrase ""free from any discrimination"" governs how the decision shall be made.
In other words, the process for making that decision.
If that process uses age or race as a negative factor, it's not made free from any discrimination. Congress chose those words carefully rejecting the private sector language later addressed in Gross and Nassar.
It did so in the unique federal sector context to create a remedy for violating constitutional equal protection rights.
This Court has said that when a plaintiff is subjected to discrimination in the process of being considered for a government benefit, he necessarily suffers a redressable equal protection injury even if he can't prove he otherwise would have received a benefit. That same injury rule governs 633a and Title VII.
That rule is fully consistent with common law principles and this Court's but-for causation analysis in other cases. The government, in this case, apparently believes it's perfectly lawful for federal agencies to apply younger-is-better or whiter-is-better hiring policies to individuals who can't prove that they would have been hired but for those policies.
That's anti-textual and it's wrong. Decisions applying such blatantly discriminatory policies are obviously not made free from any discrimination.
The government's theory contradicts the plain statutory language. But you say that the but-for causation is not required for liability, but then at the relief stage, as I understand your briefs, you say that but-for causation is required for reinstatement or back pay.
And where is that in the statutory text? So we would say that -- that at the -- at the remedial stage, ordinary remedial principles would apply, and those principles would require that the victim, the -- the plaintiff, be made whole for the violation. And under those ordinary principles that I think are undisputed on both sides, if the evidence shows that the -- the person, the plaintiff, couldn't -- wouldn't have gotten hired anyway, they shouldn't get remedies that are specifically and logically tied to that -- that thing that they -- they weren't -- wouldn't have been entitled to the in first place. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't get the kinds of prospective relief that are available in a wide array of other cases.
For example -- And why -- why would we go it's inconsistent with Chevron's political accountability rationale.
And here we have such a -- a disagreement. Secondly, as the Court held in the Ledbetter decision, Chevron doesn't apply where the Executive -- where the agency is simply interpreting this Court's decisions, since this Court is the expert at interpreting its decisions. And if you look at the EEOC adjudications in this area, the analysis tends to be quite short, it's usually about a paragraph, and all it's doing is interpreting this Court's decisions. So I think we win under the text, regardless of Chevron, but even if you think that Chevron in theory might apply here, there are two additional reasons it couldn't apply in this particular case. Mr. -- Mr. Martinez is making a distinction that -- between liability and remedy.
And he said, the bottom line, you don't get the job if somebody else was better qualified.
Nonetheless, you do get some kind of remedy so that the workplace will be free from all discrimination, any discrimination. So one possibility is injunctive relief.
We will not take age into account.
And there are other possibilities.
So -- but you seem to think everything is driven by the end result that you are not entitled to the job if, even though the age was taken into account, the person who got the job was better qualified. Your Honor, I think you're fairly characterizing my position and I'd say a couple of things on remedy. If you disagree with me on liability, I agree with them on remedy, but I also think that his position on remedy is unnecessary for the reasons of -- of my exchange with Justice Kavanaugh. You can -- you -- you essentially already have a civil -- civil service system that provides the type of relief that my friend on the other side would seek since there are a host of civil service regulations that would prohibit the types of policies that he's concerned about, even if there wasn't somebody -- a particular person in court that was challenging it under Section 633a. But our bottom line position here is that Congress added the federal and state sector extension of 633 in the Title VII at the same time.
It meant to apply the same standard to the Federal Government that applies to state and local governments and it applies to private employers. That standard is but-for causation. It results in treating all employees under the ADEA the same regardless of who you work for, since everybody agrees if you work for a private company or a state and local government, the standard is but-for causation and, respectfully, that's the thing -- the standard that we think should apply to the Federal Government as well. Unless the Court has further questions, Your Honor. Thank you, Counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Martinez. Just a few points, Your Honor.
Let me start with the text. I think it's very notable that when the Solicitor General stood up here, he began in one of the first sentence -- few sentences of his presentation by misquoting the text.
He said this statute covers ""personnel actions based on age."" He made exactly the mistake that we pointed out -- I pointed out in my initial presentation. That's not what the statute says.
It requires careful attention.
It says, ""shall be made free from any discrimination based on age."" The Solicitor General as to the text says that Congress intended to apply the exact same rules that -- that are applied to private sector employees as under the statute interpreted in Gross. Well, with respect, whatever we know about the text is that Congress did not intend to apply that regime.
Congress specifically considered that regime.
It was -- it was going to do what the Solicitor General wanted in the first draft of the statute.
Congress then amended that draft and passed a different statute.
You just can't -- you can't just apply a different statute that Congress expressly rejected. Secondly, Your Honor, with respect to the constitutional rule, I think if you look at the legislative history of -- of this provision and if you look at the Brown versus GSA decision that we talk about in our brief, it's very clear that Congress, when it enacted Title VII, which -- which uses the same causation language to apply to the federal sector, it was focused on the equal protection problem in the federal sector context. They cite Bolling versus Sharpe.
Both the legislative history and this Court's decision in Brown and makes clear -- both of them make clear that the purpose of this statute was to -- was to capture the same kind of constitutional equal protection injuries that were at stake in the long line of cases that we've cited in our brief. Now, the Solicitor General says there's no reason states should be treated any differently.
Well, again, one thing we know from the text of the statute and from the legislative history is that Congress expressly decided to treat states differently.
They treated states by -- by amending the employer definition.
They treated states like private sector actors.
They did something something totally different by creating a unique federal sector provision to govern the Federal Government.
You can't just pull that language that applies to states and say it must apply to the Federal Government. And Justice Breyer, you're absolutely right, the legislative history shows that Congress thought of the Federal Government's being especially important in this context. The Solicitor General -- this is my third point -- talks about the common law injury rule.
We are -- our rule is fully consistent with the common law rule.
If you look at the -- the Restatement, the common law third Restatement, Section 26, what it says in comment D is that the first thing you need to do when you're addressing the common law rule of causation is figure out what the injury is. What we've argued is that the injury at stake in this case is the same kind of process-based equal protection type injury that this Court has repeatedly identified in cases from Bakke up through Parents Involved.
Once you get the injury right, we are completely consistent with the common law rule. Finally, Your Honor, younger is better.
I think it's striking that the Solicitor General doubled down on his position that a younger-is-better policy does not violate this statute.
His deus ex machina here is Section 2301 of the CSRA.
That's a cruel joke that will be played on -- on this Court if you accept that rationale. Section 2301 is unenforceable. Unenforceable.
I think the Solicitor General said, Justice Kavanaugh, in response to your question, that it would give rise to a remedy of an injunction in court.
That is not accurate. If you look at the MSPB website, it specifically says that -- that this provision is not enforceable and that's the rule that courts across the country have applied. The Solicitor General has had months to come up with a solution to this hypothetical, and the best the Solicitor General can do is come up with a statutory provision that's unenforceable. That puts victims of discrimination in exactly the same position they were in before this statute was enacted, where they had remedies that were not enforceable.
Congress stepped in here.
It passed a broad statute because it wanted to protect these people. Your Honor, I leave you with the statutory text which says very clearly that all federal personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.
A decision that's made by applying a younger-is-better policy, contrary to the Solicitor General, is not made free from any discrimination based on age. You know, I -- I assume, and I hope, that we would not see within any federal agency any sort of policy like younger is -- is better.
And so I'm not sure what practical benefit you are going to provide for in the typical individual age discrimination employment case if you say that the person can't get reinstatement or whatever, absent but-for causation, but there are going to be these other equitable remedies available.
I don't know what kind of injunction would be available -- would be of practical benefit in a case like that. May -- if I may answer? Two quick points, Your Honor.
First of all, I think -- I agree with you, we would not like to see agencies doing these sorts of things.
If you look at the Brenton case that we cite at pages 41 to 42 of our brief, that case involved a -- a written memorandum.
The policy said that someone's ability to control traffic declines with age, and they were treating applicants for those positions badly for that reason. I think -- more broadly, Your Honor, I think the injunctive relief and the prospective remedies that are available are extremely important in -- in the real world, which is precisely why, in the equal protection context, you've recognized the importance of that kind of injunctive relief, and we think that relief is just as important here.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed for either of two independent reasons. First, a Rule 59(e) motion filed within 20 days of judgment is part of the first full opportunity to pursue habeas relief.
It is not a second habeas application. In the 50 years between Rule 59's adoption and AEDPA's enactment, there is no record of a court ever treating a timely Rule 59 motion merely seeking reconsideration as though it were a second habeas application.
AEDPA did not change this settled practice, and nothing in this Court's Gonzalez decision suggests otherwise. Rule 60(b) motions present obvious opportunities to circumvent AEDPA's restrictions, as the facts in Gonzalez itself well illustrate.
There, the motion was filed years after the judgment and well after the end of any appellate proceedings. Rule 59(e) motions are different. They have to be filed within 28 days of judgment, they suspend the judgment's finality, and they result in a single appeal. Second, by dismissing Mr. Banister's appeal as untimely, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized him for following the plain terms of Appellate Rule 4(a).
There's no basis in the rule or in AEDPA for retroactively recharacterizing a timely Rule 59(e) motion and treating it as though it were never filed for purposes of Rule 4(a). On this issue, Texas and the United States notably rely on a new argument, as their position is that Mr. Banister's Rule 59 motion shouldn't count because it wasn't filed properly.
But the basic problem with that argument is there's no properly filed requirement in Rule 4(a). And we think this Court should reject the government's invitation to rewrite the plain terms of that rule, which would significantly complicate what is supposed to be a clear, straightforward jurisdictional inquiry and would have implications for all civil proceedings in addition to habeas. I'd like to start with our first argument, and on that issue, our -- our rule is clear.
If a motion is filed when a court still has authority to enter or revise the judgment, before any appeal, it is part of the first habeas proceeding.
As a result, cannot be a second petition.
That -- But the -- but the motion is repetitive of the habeas petition. That is, it's -- and it's made after the entry of judgment.
So, if you were thinking, is -- is this second, yes, it is in the sense that I said it in my habeas petition, and now I'm saying it again in my Rule 59(e) motion.
It's identical argument, and it's repeated a second time. Right.
But we think that can't be the test for what counts as being second or successive.
The Court has noted that ""second or successive"" is a term of art.
So not anything that is literally filed after the first application will be treated as second or successive.
For example, an amended complaint is going to be presenting, you know, claims that could be overlapping again. What here, there clearly was a prior application.
That application was denied. And then Mr. Banister submitted a second submission that was an application under the understanding that this Court had in Gonzalez. And I don't understand my friend to have really disputed that this comes within that standard of application.
So -- Well, why is -- I move for summary judgment, denied.
Now I can't make -- go ahead with the trial, make the same motion, win on the merits. I'm not -- So they're successive.
I'm just going the language.
I'm just saying it can't mean that. So -- so, if you move for summary judgment, I mean, or something equivalent in -- You don't have to deal with that seriously.
I'm just saying -- No, no, no, but -- -- there might be many examples in a trial where you repeat what you already said, and, therefore, the question is not answered in the statute. But -- Is it still part of the same case, or is it a new thing? Well, Your Honor, though, you're eliding -- again, respectfully, you're eliding again the distinction between -- it's not the same case.
It's whether it's part of the same proceeding or -- excuse me -- it's not the proceeding, it's whether it's part of the same application. So the motion for summary judgment says you should grant my complaint in this case, you should award me relief on my complaint, but it's still going to that complaint. Once the case is -- once that complaint has been adjudicated, once you have a final decision on the habeas application, Gonzalez says that a subsequent filing that says that that determination was wrong is also an application.
And I don't know how you can think of that as anything other than a second or successive application because you already have a prior -- I guess I don't know how, if you draw the line there, you deal with an amended application.
An amendment can be, you know, significantly different. That's true, Your Honor, and the statute expressly provides for that.
In Section 2242, Congress says that you can amend a habeas petition in accordance with the applicable civil rules. So that provides for amendments, and it makes clear that that amendment still goes to the same application.
There's no similar carveout for Rule 59(e). And, if I could, I want to make sure I get to the Section 2266 question that you asked about, Justice Kavanaugh, because I think it's related. In that section, Congress went through and laid out -- it looked very carefully at capital cases where it wanted to move the proceedings along, and it laid out deadlines for every one of the motions that it thought could be filed in every habeas case.
Just incredibly detailed there.
And it said nothing at all about Rule 59(e). Now my friend says that our argument is over-inclusive because it doesn't say -- because we acknowledge that you can file Rule 59(e) motions in some cases where they don't actually make habeas claims, but, just to be clear, our argument is more modest.
It's not that because Section 2266 doesn't mention Rule 59(e) motions, they're categorically prohibited. Our argument is that when Congress looked really carefully at this and tried to set out deadlines for how this system should work in the federal courts, it would have been really odd for Congress to leave out Rule 59(e) motions if, in fact, you could file in every single case a Rule 59(e) motion that asks the district court to readjudicate all of the arguments that it had already considered, because we know in that provision that Congress was trying to light a fire under the courts and make sure that those things are -- are decided. Congress would not have wanted to say you have to make the initial decision, the initial final decision on the habeas application within 450 days or 60 days from when it's submitted for judgment, but then you don't need to adjudicate -- you don't need to adjudicate that if there's a Rule 59(e) motion filed afterwards. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Three quick points.
First, I wanted to address the other side's test.
My friend from the United States was focusing on the test being -- whether there was a prior application filed, but, as Justice Kagan pointed out, that can't be the test because that would incorporate amended complaints as well, and everyone agrees that that would not count as a second habeas application. The fallback position that I think Texas has forcefully advocated is that it should be the time of judgment.
But that too is inconsistent with the structure of AEDPA because, in that, if you followed that logic, a petition for rehearing, which clearly is something that is in the appellate courts, which clearly is something that is filed after judgment, after the court of appeals has reached a determination, is asking them to say, hey, you got it wrong, we want you to revisit that, would not -- would also be a habeas application. Their answer to both of those points is that, well, AEDPA specifically contemplates amended complaints and specifically contemplates petition for rehearing, but I take that just as an acknowledgment that their test is inconsistent with the structure of the statute, and they're having to develop ad hoc exceptions in order to -- to read them in. Remember, under rule -- Habeas Rule 12, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a default apply in habeas proceedings.
You have to demonstrate an inconsistency with the statute.
So the fact that AEDPA doesn't specifically call them out and -- and recognize Rule 59(e) motions does not establish an inconsistency. The other point I wanted to make, I didn't hear a response from the other side to Justice Gorsuch's question about why their process is not going to be much more burdensome in practice.
A lot of the other side's arguments go to a theory that there should not be Rule 59(e) motions in habeas at all.
But, of course, that's not their position, and they can't get there as a matter of text. So it just is going to be the case that in every instance a district court is going to need to make this threshold inquiry about whether something is presenting a claim. Mr. Snyder said that that inquiry is going to be easy to determine.
Maybe in some cases it will.
But there certainly are going to be hard cases, and I think Fifth Circuit precedent alone bears that out. For example, the Fifth Circuit considers a motion that -- that argues to the district judge: Hey, you just missed this argument, you didn't rule on it at all, the Fifth Circuit considers that to be an attack on the integrity of the judicial proceeding, which is distinct in their view from arguing, district court, you got it wrong. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit takes the view that alleging a conflict of interest by habeas counsel would be attack on the integrity of the proceeding, even though this Court recognized in Gonzalez that merely arguing that appellate -- that habeas counsel missed an issue or failed to develop it would not be something that goes to the integrity of the proceeding. The point is not whether the Fifth Circuit is right or wrong about those classifications but that there are boundary cases and that it can be difficult.
And to require a Fifth -- a district court to make those threshold determinations and then potentially to have a court of appeals make a different determination about it is going to be much less efficient, is going to create real uncertainty about rules that are supposed to be clear and -- and -- and are linked to the time to appeal. The last point I'd like to make is with regard to Rule 4(a) and to Texas's argument about that.
Their argument, as I understand it, relies on examples that exclusively involve instances that are not seeking genuine Rule 59(e) relief and you need to look beyond the pleading to that -- to at least that extent. Well, that requirement comes right in the text of the rule itself.
It has to be a motion under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment.
If you title something Rule 59(e) and then you ask for attorneys' fees or you title it Rule 59(e) and say I want an extension, but you don't actually ask to alter or amend the judgment, it doesn't satisfy the plain text of the rule. But Texas has expressly conceded -- this is at page 44 of their brief -- that Mr. Banister did file a true Rule 59(e) motion. They just think it should be subject to Section 2244(b).
But, even if it is, that doesn't mean that the motion wasn't filed, that it was a true Rule 59(e) motion seeking that relief, and that is all that Rule 4(a) requires. If the Court has no further questions, we ask you to reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-631, William Barr, Attorney General versus the American Association of Political Consultants. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to turn their cell phones off. Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1991, Congress enacted the TCPA's basic restriction on the placement of automated calls to cell phones.
In the years that followed, lower courts consistently upheld the constitutionality of that provision as a content-neutral restriction on the use of calling technologies that consumers found particularly intrusive and annoying. Congress's enactment of the government-debt exception in 2015 did not introduce any constitutional infirmity into the statutory scheme.
That exception is limited to a narrow category of calls that intrude less severely on consumer privacy than does the typical automated call and that serve an important countervailing interest in protecting the federal fisc. There's been a good deal of back and forth in the briefs about whether Respondents' challenge is properly viewed as one to the exception or to the general automated-call restriction.
And I think, in circumstances like this, there's not a right way and a wrong way, not a right or wrong challenge to bring. There's simply two conceptually distinct analytical -- analytical ways of challenging a law that includes a basic restriction subject to exceptions. Here, we think that both challenges could have been brought but that both would fail.
But I'd like to focus first on the challenge that Respondent is asserting in its brief.
These are the -- this is the challenge that Respondents are asking the Court to focus on. And that is the challenge to the underlying automated-call restriction.
And Respondents' basic theory is that the government-debt exception, taken in combination with other aspects of the statutory scheme, prevents the automated-call restriction from performing its intended consumer protection function, renders it insufficiently efficacious to be upheld under the First Amendment. And we think that's wrong.
If you look at the statute, the only other statutory exceptions to the automated-call restriction are those for emergency calls and calls with -- made with the prior express consent of the recipient. And Respondents have not contended that either of those is -- raises a First Amendment problem or casts doubt on the efficacy of the underlying restriction. Mr. Stewart, your -- So that -- -- your -- one of your basic points to avoid strict scrutiny under the First Amendment is that you're not really looking at the content of the communication in this case, but, rather, it's more properly viewed as part of an economic relationship. I don't see how that gets you out of the content category.
You still have to look carefully at what's being said before you can decide whether the phone call is covered by the provision or not.
I think that's the clear holding of our decision in the Reed case. Well, I think that as -- let me -- let me address Reed first and foremost.
At the outset of the Court's analysis in Reed, after thought that all -- all robo-calls should be prohibited, with some exceptions that you're not -- you have no complaint with. The second Congress, acting in a different time, had a different judgment about which calls should be permitted, and that included this government-debt exception.
And we don't know whether the second Congress enacting the revised statute would prefer a situation in which all calls are prohibited or all calls are allowed.
Does that -- does that sum it up? I think that sums it up, with one small caveat, which is that we are talking now on the assumption that this -- there -- that there is a severability analysis that's required here that turns on intent. I do think our -- our primary position is that the nature of the First Amendment and the nature of the constitutional flaw in this statute, which is the -- the flaw with the restriction, we think that that means that essentially, under -- under everyone's understanding of -- of severability principles, the restriction must be struck down. Thank you, counsel. And then -- I'm sorry, Justice Gorsuch? No, I'm fine.
Thank you, Chief. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good afternoon, Mr. Martinez.
On severability -- Good afternoon. -- we have no precedent either way on severability, as I understand it, when the First Amendment problem is created by an exception to a ban on speech, rather than the First Amendment problem being created by the underlying ban without the exception.
So I don't think we have any precedent either way. And the question, as you've pointed out and Mr. Stewart's pointed out, is level up or level down as the remedy. The key first question -- and I asked Mr. Stewart about this; I want to make sure I have you on this -- is the underlying restriction here, the underlying restriction on cell phone robo-calls, constitutional without the government-debt exception? So I want you to focus exactly on that question. Yes.
We -- we think that -- that given all the evidence we know now about what Congress's interests are and how strongly they believe or don't believe in the privacy interests, we believe that the restriction is unconstitutional. And I think the two prime -- Let me just -- let me make sure I have you exactly right.
The underlying restriction, if there had never been a government-debt exception -- let me phrase it that way.
If there had never been a government-debt exception, is the underlying restriction unconstitutional? We would say yes based primarily on the differential treatment of the residential call bans.
But I just want to say one thing on that, Justice Kavanaugh, because if you -- you want me to hypothesize that -- that the -- that the 2015 law had never been passed. Correct. I think that the 2015 law, if you think about that law as evidence -- as evidence of what Congress thought about privacy, the fact that it wasn't passed doesn't mean that deep down Congress believed in privacy more than we later -- you know, than was later revealed. And so I think it's important to recognize that, in our argument, the role of the 2015 exception is not merely to introduce the textual content-based distinction, but it's also to reveal the underlying lack of justification, which was always there.
And, again -- Well, I'm not -- I guess on that point I would pick up on what the Chief Justice said and -- and the states' amicus brief.
And if you just take a peek, just a peek, at the real world here, this is one of the more popular laws on the books because people don't like cell phone robo-calls. That seems just common sense.
Do you want to argue against that common sense? I think aspects of the law are popular.
I think, you know, the head of the FCC has called this law the -- ""the poster child for lawsuit abuse."" And the reason for that is -- and this is indirectly implicated in this case -- there's a whole bunch of other problems with the law as well. And so I think this law has its supporters and its detractors, but I don't think you should worry about Congress's ability to protect people.
Even if we win this case, Congress is going to have plenty of options that are fully constitutional in order to protect people from -- from unwanted calls. It can focus on the telemarketing calls.
It can focus -- it can expand the remedies available under the Do Not Call list, which essentially allow consumers to -- Well, even if -- -- to opt -- -- even if you -- -- out. -- even -- sorry. Even if you lose this case, Congress can, of course, scale back when you view as overbroad restrictions, but if you lose this case, Congress will still have in place a restriction that's been on the books for 30 years and that has been perceived as constitutional and that is very popular. Well -- well, I -- I -- I -- I -- I guess what I would say is that I think the right way to think about this is to apply the doctrinal tools that you always apply in First Amendment cases, even in cases where the speech involved is not popular. I mean, the First Amendment is there not just to protect speech that people like but to protect speech -- Yeah. -- that people might find offensive or -- or annoying.
And -- and -- Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Martinez, would you like to take a minute to wrap up? Thank you, Your Honor. The -- the core purpose of the First Amendment is to protect the free exchange of political speech, even when people might find that speech to be a nuisance.
That's what this Court recognized in the Martin case when it said that First Amendment rights protect people from -- from making intrusive door-to-door solicitations.
That's protected activity.
The calls at issue here are protected activity as well. We ask you to do what you always do in First Amendment cases, strike down the unconstitutional restriction on speech.
Thank you, Your Honors. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have rebuttal? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I took Mr. Martinez to acknowledge that if -- if this were a restriction on speech undertaken to collect a government-backed debt, it would be subject at most to intermediate scrutiny because it would be commercial speech and would be subject to distinct First Amendment treatment on that basis. And the -- the position of the other side is this provision should be reviewed more skeptically, should be subject to more certiorari review because its effect is to take particular speech out from under regulation rather than to regulate it. And that's contrary to the -- the usual understanding that the First Amendment exists to foster speech.
It's contrary to the Court's reference in Reed to laws that target speech because of its communicative content. Why would the Court review more skeptically the law that looked at the same basis as a rationale for exempting speech rather than to regulate? The second thing is Mr. Martinez said many times that Congress and the FCC have exempted non-commercial calls from the automated-call restriction.
And I think that really overlooks the respective responsibilities of Congress and the FCC. Congress has broadly regulated at least calls using a pre-recorded voice or an artificial voice to residential landlines just as it has calls to cell phones.
Both of the underlying bans encompass non-commercial calls. Congress has vested the FCC with broad, though not identical, authority to exempt particular categories of calls from the residential and the cell phone ban respectively, and you can look at page 5A and 6A of the appendix to the government's merits brief to see that the -- the exemption authority is -- is basically comparable. The discrepancy under current law results from the fact that the FCC has exercised its exemption authority much more robustly with respect to residential landlines than it has with respect to cell phones.
That can't create a facial constitutional infirmity in the statute itself.
If people think that the FCC should adopt comparable exemptions for non-commercial calls to cell phones, they can file a petition to that effect. The -- the last thing I'd say in respect is -- goes to the colloquy between Mr. Martinez and Justice Kagan, where Mr. Martinez said, yes, if they had framed it not in terms of the content of the call but in terms of all calls from the holder of a government-backed debt to -- to the debtor that that would be subject to more relaxed scrutiny.
And that would simply be -- an approach that distinguished on that basis would simply encourage Congress to enact laws with more of a broad brush. It would discourage Congress from trying to fine-tune laws, and that discouragement would only be exacerbated if we took the Respondents' approach to severability striking down the whole law. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-725, Barton versus Barr. Mr. Unikowsky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question before the Court today is, what does it mean for an offense to render an alien inadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule? The Court should hold that an offense renders an alien inadmissible if the immigration judge finds that the offense renders the alien inadmissible at the removal hearing that precipitates the need to apply the stop-time rule. If the Court disagrees with that and agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that inadmissible is a status, it should hold that an alien acquires that status when the alien is capable of being charged with inadmissibility. In this case, neither condition is satisfied.
Petitioner was not found inadmissible.
He wasn't capable of being found inadmissible.
Therefore, he was not rendered inadmissible. So I'd like to begin this morning with a concession the government makes at pages 29 and 30 of its brief which I think narrows the issues in this case somewhat.
So the government concedes that when the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable,"" which are the crucial words in the stop-time rule, when those words are used in a statute that has a connection to the alien's own removal proceeding, they're a reference to the charge against the alien at that proceeding. They're not a status. So the government agrees that in those contexts, its proposed interpretation of the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule is incorrect.
So, in Section 1226, the mandatory detention statute, that says that an alien who is inadmissible by reason of having committed an offense under Section 1182 is subject to mandatory detention, the government agrees there that ""inadmissible"" is a reference to inadmissible at the proceeding, not just the status of being inadmissible. The government says that's natural in that context, and we agree, because that's a statute with the relationship to the alien's removal. Same thing in Section 1252.
That's the jurisdiction-stripping statute.
That says that courts of appeals don't have jurisdiction to hear petitions for review by an alien who is removable for certain specified reasons.
There, too, the government agrees removable is not the status; it's a reference to the actual charge at the hearing, and they say that's natural in that context because the statute has a connection to the alien's removal proceeding. So the question in this case boils down to whether the government has put forward a sufficient case for holding that the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule mean something different from what it concedes they mean in these adjacent or nearby statutes addressing the same subject matter. And I don't think the government has put forward that case, because I think that many of the contextual clues that apply in the nearby statutes also apply in the stop-time rule, or at least there isn't a sufficient reason for construing those statutes differently. So, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the stop-time rule is applied get cancellation right off the bat.
So, even today, that provision is not doing a ton of work. Mr. Liu, could you make sense of the verb tenses for me? Because I would think that you would have an extremely good argument if the tenses were subjunctive, you know, if it said -- if it would render the alien inadmissible.
But it doesn't say that. It says renders the alien inadmissible, which seems not to refer to something that could happen in the future if the alien, again, tried to gain admission. Right.
And I -- I -- I think the ""renders inadmissible,"" the present tense, just reinforces our interpretation because, if you look at the text of 1182 itself, it says any alien convicted of ""a crime involving moral turpitude"" is inadmissible. So, for the tenses to match, the present tense in 1182 itself to match with the stop-time rule, I think the present tense makes a lot of sense.
And I think this -- this is in partial response to Justice Breyer's question. Our -- our position is not a hypothetical alien would be inadmissible and, therefore, time stops for this alien.
Our position very much is, for this particular alien, this offense renders him inadmissible. And that just follows -- I mean, it -- -- from the text -- -- just is a kind of odd thing to say when we know the alien has been admitted and could be -- you know, could live here indefinitely if he hadn't gotten into other trouble, right? I don't -- Nobody walks around going, oh, you've been admitted, but, you know -- you know, let's -- let's -- let's -- let's try to figure out whether you're inadmissible if you try to -- if you try to gain admission the next time around? I mean, I -- I don't think that's right.
If I were a lawyer representing a client who had already been admitted, I would definitely describe the consequences of his status as inadmissible after he had committed a crime like this. And I would use the present tense to be exceptionally clear about those consequences. I think there is a different verb tense change here between ""alien has committed"" and ""renders inadmissible,"" but that -- that just, I think, dovetails with our understanding as well, because the ""rendering inadmissible"" always has to occur after the alien has committed the offense. Is your point about (a)(4) because it's an aggravated felony? No, no. What was your (a)(4) point? 1227(a)(4) covers security-related grounds -- Yeah. -- for deportability.
So, if someone has engaged in terrorist activity, for example, he would come within the scope of (a)(4).
If you look at 1229b(c)(4), this is on page 37 of our petition appendix, it says an alien who is ... deportable under Section 1227(a)(4) is simply categorically ineligible for cancellation of removal.
And that applies to two types of cancellation, not all the types, but the two types that we have been discussing here today. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Unikowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to begin by a comment that my colleague made that they are giving the word ""inadmissible"" the same consistent meaning across the statute.
That's just not accurate. So, in the mandatory detention statute, it says that an alien who is inadmissible by reason of having committed an offense under 1182 is subject to mandatory detention. Giving that meaning -- word the same consistent meaning, it would apply to any alien who merely has the status of inadmissible even if you've already been admitted.
That's what they say ""inadmissible"" means in the stop-time rule. They conceded that can't be right.
An already admitted alien can't be inadmissible for purposes of that statute.
So they are giving it a different meaning. Now the Chief Justice posed a question saying that, well, it seems to be on both sides and so it's a wash.
I think if it is a wash, that it's very good for us because there's all the other stuff.
There's the surplusage, there's the comparison to good moral character, and there's the structure of the INA and everything else. But I'd just like to push back a little bit on the idea that it's a wash because it seems to me that the statutes we're comparing it to are more relevant than the ones they are. So like this mandatory detention statute, it's covering removal procedures.
It was enacted in IRRARA along with the stop-time rule just a couple sections over.
That strikes me as more relevant than provisions that were enacted many years earlier that don't apply to LPRs at all, which is what the government is -- is relying upon. So I actually think that the consistent usage canon favors us, especially when you look at just the intro to the cancellation of removal statute that says the attorney general may cancel removal for an alien who is inadmissible or removable.
Like, that's using ""inadmissible"" in the way we say and it's the same statute.
In fact, like the stop-time rule is just a definitional provision under that umbrella. So the second thing I'd like to turn to is this question about the fish, which was a colorful question by -- by Justice Alito that the Eleventh Circuit relied on similar arguments. Look, we're not denying that it's -- that you can -- b-l-e words sometimes sound like a status.
Clearly, that's true, but it's just as clear that sometimes it's obvious that when you're talking about the removal proceeding itself, the word ""inadmissible"" refers to what happened at the removal proceeding. So I just think it's -- it's just inescapable that you have to look at the context in which the word appears.
I don't think that the Eleventh Circuit's comparison to undrinkable really can answer the question presented.
And in the context of the statute, which applies only during removal proceedings in which all the surrounding provisions seem to conceptualize this dichotomy between inadmissible and deportable, I think the context which you -- you just kind of have to look at ultimately favors our position. I'd also like just to say a word about surplusage, which I understand occupied a portion of the -- of the -- of my colleague's argument.
So, first, on this narrow issue of 1227(a)(4), just to be clear, it's not as though the government's interpretation gives that meaning that ours doesn't, right? So 1227(a)(4) was really an empty category at the time because it didn't have any cross-references to 1182. That's true on both sides.
So it's not -- it's not one of those cases where both sides give one word meaning that the other side doesn't.
Like for both sides, it's not clear why Congress included that, except for the purpose of subsequent amendments which actually did ultimately materialize.
But the surplusage on the government side is a -- is a lot more significant in the hope that the removal clause isn't there. It's not just a matter that there's surplusage.
I mean, surplusage is generally bad.
But I think here it's more than that.
You see the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" paired with each other.
And I think that just implies that Congress is thinking that those are the two things that can happen to you.
And if you're inadmissible, you fall in one bucket, and if you're removable, you're in another bucket. And we see all over the adjacent statutes this concept of inadmissibility and deportability together with an ""or"" in between.
And it's -- it's clear in all those contexts that that's why that's -- that's why they're there, because those are the -- the two true outcomes. So just in -- in the intro of the cancellation of removal statute, where it says the attorney general may cancel removal of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable. Clearly, the reason those two things are paired together is that those are the two things that can happen to you.
And so that's why they're both there. And the same in just the general statute governing removal procedures, 1229a, that says that the immigration judge shall decide the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien, it's clear why those two words are there with the ""or"" in between, because those are the two things that can happen. So you go to the stop-time rule, which, after all, is -- is just like a buried definitional provision in the cancellation of removal statute itself, and you have ""inadmissible"" or ""removable."" And the natural inference is that the reason those are there is that those are the two things that can happen. That fits our interpretation perfectly because, if you're found inadmissible, then you're in the admissible category.
And if you're found deportable, then you're in the deportable category, or removal category. Excuse me.
I think that's a lot more persuasive than this rather convoluted argument from the government which apparently the government didn't even think of until its brief in this case because it explicitly did -- did not make this argument in an en banc petition filed less than a year ago. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1618, Bostock versus Clayton County, and the consolidated case. Ms. Karlan. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII. The employer has, in the words of Section 703(a), discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing.
And that discrimination is because of sex, again in the words of Section 703(a), because the adverse employment action is based on the male employee's failure to conform to a particular expectation about how men should behave; namely, that men should be attracted only to women and not to men. There is no analytic difference between this kind of discrimination and forms of discrimination that have been already recognized by every court to have addressed them.
For example, discrimination against men who are effeminate rather than macho.
Like the discrimination here, that discrimination is because of non-conformity with an expectation about how men should behave. The attempt to carve out discrimination against men for being gay from Title VII cannot be administered with either consistency or integrity.
In the words of the en banc Second Circuit, it forces judges to result -- resort to lexical bean counting where they count up the frequency of epithets, such as ""fag,"" ""gay,"" ""queer,"" ""real man,"" and ""fem,"" to determine whether or not discrimination is based on sex or sexual orientation. That attempt is futile because when a man is discriminated against for being gay, he is discriminated against for not conforming to an expectation about how men should behave. Finally, the possibility that some employers, but not the employers here, may have policies of denying employment opportunities both to gay men and to lesbians does not change the unlawfulness of what was alleged by the employees here. Labeling those policies under an umbrella phrase like ""sexual orientation discrimination"" cannot hide the fact that such an employer is a double discriminator.
It discriminates against men who do not conform to a male stereotype, and it discriminates against women who do not conform to an expectation about female -- Ms. Karlan -- Ms. Karlan, how do you answer the argument that back in 1964, this could not have been in Congress's mind because in -- in many states male same-sex relations was a criminal offense; the American Psychiatric Association labeled homosexuality a -- a mental illness? Well, I think you read the words of the statute.
And this Court has recognized again and again forms of sex discrimination that were not in Congress's contemplation in 1964. In 1964, those were the days of Mad Men, so the idea that sexual harassment would have been reached, most courts didn't find sexual harassment to be actionable until this Court did.
In Price Waterhouse, this Court recognized that discrimination against a woman who cursed like a sailor, walked like a man, and didn't wear makeup was responses.
First, I don't think that one contributing cause is sex.
I think that as long as you're treating gay men and women exactly the same regardless of their sex, the contributing cause is sexual orientation, not sex. And, two, I think it reflects the fact that sex and sexual orientation are different traits.
And if you do the analysis the way my friends on the other side suggested, you've completely eliminated the distinction between two very different traits and you've -- and you've essentially rendered -- you nullified Congress's careful -- very careful decisions in numerous other statutes to specifically protect sexual orientation and gender identities, we'll -- Is there -- Is there anything -- -- get to in the next case. -- in this record showing that the employers would not employ lesbian women? You know, Your Honor, in these cases, and this may have been a better question for my colleague, but I think in these cases, the employers have -- in the cases -- the sexual orientation cases, the employers have generally denied that they discriminate based on -- But all we know on -- -- their sexual orientation. Did this go -- the -- the -- the allegation is that the person was discharged when he announced that he was gay.
There's nothing in the record as far as I can see that there was a policy on the employer's part of discharging or not -- Right. -- discharging lesbian women. I think that's right.
I think basically the employer's defenses here were, one, I didn't fire him because he was gay, but, two, if you think I did, Title VII doesn't prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. And if I could address lastly the point that the Chief Justice and Justice Alito were raising about so-called legislative updating that Judge Posner suggested, here I think that a judicial ruling would be particularly pernicious because when Congress seeks to expand the scope of Title VII's liability provisions, it typically couples that itself with an expansion of the religious employers exemption to Title VII, precisely because issues of sexual orientation like issues of gender identity raise different issues from a religious liberty perspective. The employee's position here would only do half of that work.
It would expand the scope of liability without giving any consideration to those religious liberty interests on the other side of the balance, and that is precisely why this is the type of issue that is better left to Congress than the courts. Justice Gorsuch, I want to make sure that I fully addressed your -- your textual considerations, though, because I really do think it boils down to the fact that sex and sexual orientation are different traits. May I finish my answer? Sure. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on one of those traits, as long as you treat men and women who are similarly situated with respect to the other trait exactly the same, you're not ""discriminating"" under -- within the meaning of Title VII. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Five minutes, Ms. Karlan. Thank you. Let me start with the question that Justice Ginsburg asked because I think it's illustrative of contemporary sexual orientation discrimination cases. Virtually none of them involve an employer, and neither of the cases before you does, who claims to have an across-the-board policy of firing both all gay men and all lesbians. What tends to happen, and this case is illustrative of this, is a man who also doesn't conform with some other gender-based stereotypes and who is gay gets fired, which puts them in exactly the position that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, which is really devilishly hard to figure out what's going on here. The second point I just want to leave the Court with is, the entire argument on the other side depends on the idea that men who are gay and women who are lesbians are being treated the same.
And that's just not so. Because if you look at what actually causes the problem, it's the man who says, I married my partner, Bill.
If any woman who worked there had married Bill, he wouldn't -- she would not have been fired.
And he is. And you have to look, because the textual language tells you to, at such individual and not at the overall class. Ms. Karlan, would you address these -- General's statement at the end? He -- he goes back to the comparator should be a woman who -- a -- a man who likes a man and a woman who likes a woman.
You're trying to get to that. I -- I -- yes.
I think he -- he is varying two things there.
One, he is varying the sex of the employee and, second, he's varying the sex of the person to whom the employee is interested. And if two things that -- So give us an example from a case how you can't do that. I'm not sure -- of course you can do it but you don't have to.
Because all you need to do is show that sex played a role here. And if the answer is if a man had -- if a woman had come in and said, I like to date men, you wouldn't have fired her, and when a man says, I like to date men, you did, that's enough to show sex discrimination. But what if the decision maker makes a decision based on sexual orientation but does not know the biological sex of the person involved? Well, there is no reported case that does that.
And I -- All right. -- think the Court -- But what if it -- what if it -- -- can wrestle with -- What if it happened? We have had a lot of hypotheticals of things that may or may not have happened. What if that happens? Is that discrimination on the basis of sex where the decision maker doesn't even know the person's sex? And -- and how do they know the person's sexual orientation? Because somebody who interviewed the candidates tells them that. And they are unable to tell anything about the person's sex? No. So this is Saturday Night Live Pat, as -- as an example, right? (Laughter.) Well, I'm not familiar with that. Okay. But -- Which is the person named Pat, and you can never tell whether Pat is a man or a woman. I mean, theoretically that person might be out there.
But here is the key -- Theoretically what? Theoretically that person might be out there.
But here is the key: The -- the cases that are brought are almost all brought by somebody who says my employer knew who I was and fired me because I was a man or fired me because I was a woman. Somebody who comes in and says I'm not going to tell you what my sex is, but, believe me, I was fired for my sexual orientation, that person will lose. Well, if that's the case, then I think your whole argument collapses because sexual orientation then is a different thing from sex. Of course it is.
No one has claimed that sexual orientation is the same thing as sex.
What we are saying is when somebody is fired who -- Well, let me amend it. Your argument is that sex -- discrimination based on sexual orientation necessarily entails discrimination based on sex. But if it's the case that there would be no liability in the situation where the decision maker has no knowledge of sex, then that can't possibly be true. If there was that case, it might be the rare case in which sexual orientation discrimination is not a subset of sex. But in the case where the person knows the sex of the person that they're firing or refusing to hire, and knows the sex of the people to whom that person is attracted, that is sex discrimination, pure and simple. And it's important to understand that -- and -- and this goes back to something that Justice Ginsburg asked during the opening argument, that discrimination against gay men and discrimination against lesbians is not one thing. And in 1964, if you look at the members of Congress's brief, they will tell you if you looked in the dictionary there was no phrase ""sexual orientation."" That is a modern way of combining two kinds of discrimination: Discrimination against gay men, which goes back to Leviticus and the common law, and discrimination against lesbians, which was not part of Leviticus and was not part of the common law. Indeed, in 1964, there were only 16 states in the United States that clearly forbid some act in which lesbians could engage. So the idea that this is one large idea about sexual orientation discrimination in the abstract, without reference to sex, simply burkes the history and burkes the understanding. And if you look at the harassment cases, you will see why this is true.
Gay men are harassed in a different way than lesbians. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 19-465, Chiafalo and others versus the State of Washington. Mr. Lessig. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court: The cases -- the question in these cases is straightforward: Do the states have the power to control through law how an elector may vote? They do not.
The ordinary expected meaning of the words of the Constitution, against the background of the framers' deliberation, make it clear that the states have no such power. But what is also clear is that Washington does not like the Constitution's design.
It asks this Court to read the word ""elector"" as agent or, maybe better, minion, and it declares that the votes electors cast are not, as the Constitution expressly describes them, their votes, meaning the electors' votes, but instead are the votes of the state.
Article II in Washington's hands effectively gives the states the power to cast votes for President in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct. But the actual Article II does not give the states the power to cast votes.
It gives the states the power to appoint electors. And the actual electors that the Constitution creates have a legal discretion, as every elector does, not an unfettered discretion, as Washington puts it.
To the contrary, a completely fettered discretion, just fettered by moral and political obligations, not by legal constraint. Washington's alternative to ""vest discretion in citizens rather than electors"" may be a better plan, at least as part of a coherent change, but the question for this Court is not which plan would be better.
The question is which plan is the Constitution's now. And the answer to that question is clear in the Constitution's text.
The states get to appoint, no doubt, but they appoint electors who are then privileged to cast their votes without regulation by the state. Mr. Lessig, do you object to the pledge itself? Assume there's no fine or any other sanction.
Is simply requiring a prospective elector to take a pledge okay in your view? Absolutely, Your Honor. A pledge, understood the way Ray understood a pledge, having no legal obligation but a moral obligation, is perfectly fine pursuant -- as part of the appointment power of the state. Well, then -- so -- so the addition of a sanction makes no difference? No, the sanction makes all the difference.
So long as there is not a legal sanction, then a pledge is appropriate. It's the same -- the same in the context, Your Honor -- Your Honor, of -- of the -- of the Speech and Debate Clause. Of course, you can't punish somebody for a vote in Congress, but there's nothing inconsistent with the Speech and Debate Clause in asking a member to make a pledge.
Indeed, states right now ask members to make a pledge as a condition of being a party member. So, if there were a fine of one dollar, you would say that violates the Constitution, but if it's simply a pledge, no violation at follow and -- and keep their promise and vote as directed.
So the order is -- is -- is proper.
It's -- it's appointment.
It -- it -- and, you know, depending when in the process the elector announces their intentions, they're removed and they're replaced by someone else who votes in accordance with state law. And to come back to my example from earlier if I can, there's really no meaningful difference between the person who says, I don't like our nominee, I'm not showing up for the meeting, and one who says, I don't like our nominee, I'm showing up for the meeting and I'm voting for somebody else. The State -- both -- both people have violated valid conditions of appointment, both people can be removed by the State and replaced by someone else. The other side's position is neither of those people can be replaced.
And -- and -- and even the person who says, I'm not showing up because, you know, somebody gave me two million dollars to not show up because that might affect the outcome of the election, the other side says that person can't be replaced.
That just makes absolutely no sense historically, textually, or practically. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, General Purcell.
If you're right about the electors not having this kind of discretion from the Constitution, I wanted to get your take on a provision of Article II, Section 1 that says, no senator or representative or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector. What is the purpose you see of that provision if your theory of the electors is correct? Yes, Justice Kavanaugh. Thank you for that question. So the framers did not spend a whole lot of time talking about the exact role of electors, and they certainly did not agree on exactly what role they would play, but one thing that they were clear on was they did not want Congress choosing the President. And so they specifically prohibited members of Congress from serving in that role. But other -- but they left it to states to decide whether electors would serve as kind of -- you know, as Hamilton envisioned them, as the kind of sage chooser on behalf of the states or, as many other framers wanted, the electors to be agents of the people, to -- to -- to act on the people's behalf and for the people to choose them and for them to be bound to that outcome, to be bound to the people's preference. So -- so, yes, they imposed that limited limitation on who could serve, and -- and that is, you know, another example of a constitutional condition limiting states' authority.
But, again, it just goes to the point that if -- if the state can set a condition to serve as an elector, that condition can be enforced. Mr. Lessig says that the framers considered various modes, obviously, and you agree and history shows they considered the states doing it directly, or at least that was an idea out there through the legislatures or governors.
They considered Congress, as you just pointed out, but there was a separation of powers there, problem there. They didn't necessarily want the new President to be too dependent on Congress.
A popular election was -- was not adopted. And so they came up instead with what Mr. Lessig describes as a indirect mode of selection with the model of electors who would exercise, as he sees it, their own discretion and independent judgment to pick the best person to be President, the best person to head the executive branch. And he says that mode remains indirect, consistent with the framers' choice, only if the electors retain a legal discretion. So, on that overall structure that Mr. Lessig sets up and describes the history, why is he not right, given that they rejected all these other modes? Your Honor, the number -- the framers had a number of concerns about direct elections that included logistical concerns and concerns about the impact on the influence of southern states, but, ultimately, they settled on an approach that left it to the states to decide, as this Court said in McPherson, the broadest possible power of determination as to how to appoint electors and what role they would play. And -- and the -- the options open to states certainly included both leaving electors with discretion, as some states still do today, and states choosing electors specifically because they have pledged to support a particular candidate.
And, certainly, by the time of the Twelfth Amendment, that had become the virtually universal practice in states. And the framers of the Twelfth Amendment well understood that and -- and adopted the -- the language of the Twelfth Amendment to facilitate that.
And if you need a historical example, if that would be helpful, in -- in the election of 1804, right after adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, it -- it operated just as they had expected.
The parties put forward presidential and vice presidential tickets, electors were chosen throughout the country because they supported those tickets, and every single elector in the country voted for the party ticket preferred by their state's voters. And -- and the meetings of the electors, even in 1804, were in many states mere formalities.
They -- they filled out pre-prepared ballots.
They did not discuss or deliberate.
And Congress did not question a single one of those ballots or their validity. So that just shows that by the time of the Twelfth Amendment, as this Court has said repeatedly, the role of electors was simply to transmit the vote of the state for President. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
Would you like to take a minute to wrap up? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief -- Yes, I would. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Every four years, over 100 million Americans participate in our country's presidential election process.
They attend rallies, they watch debates, and, ultimately, they go to the polls. More Americans participate in this election than in any other democratic process in our system of government.
But, under Petitioners' theory, this entire process is irrelevant and always has been because all that matters is who the electors prefer. On their view, the electors can choose whoever they want to be President, regardless of any voluntary commitments they made to secure their position, regardless of how their state voted, and regardless of whether they are being bribed or blackmailed for their vote. That is not the law.
The Constitution's text, the original understanding, this Court's precedent, and our country's historical practice all demonstrate that states are allowed to require presidential electors to vote for the candidate chosen by the state's voters and to enforce that requirement. We ask you to reaffirm that principle today. Thank you. Thank you, General. Mr. Lessig, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Your -- Your Honors, the State has relied upon early statutes which it says affirm the power of the state to remove electors because they violate a condition.
Absolutely none of those statutes have anything to do with the conditions on voting. Those statutes related to the appointment power.
They were incidental to the appointment power.
So you can see obviously that, incidental to the appointment power, the State has the authority to make sure someone -- someone shows up to vote.
And we believe that general laws apply to electors as well.
This is not a general immunity.
But they have no power to control the vote and they never have exercised that. The State has asserted that because they appoint the electors, they get to control the electors.
But, in fact, the authority they rely on is quite explicit.
Myers, at page 119, says the reason for this is that those in charge of and responsible for administering functions of government need the authority to control them by removing them.
That was the reason for the principle. But there is nothing in the founding to suggest that the framers imagined the states administering the Electoral College.
That's why the states don't appear in the Twelfth Amendment at all. And, finally, Your Honor, if you recognize this power, how do you cabin it? If you find the State has the power to regulate electoral votes, may the State forbid the elector from voting for a candidate who has not visited the state, who has not released his tax returns, as bills in New Jersey and New York purport to do, or has not pledged to appoint justices who will uphold Roe? Open this door and there are an endless list of partisan opportunisms that will tempt the states.
Throughout history, there have been amendments to change the elector discretion, every single time recognizing there was that discretion. For the State of Washington, in 1977, to discover it is to show they were chumps believing they didn't have this power.
And we believe the power has always been with electors to exercise discretion. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-565, CITGO Asphalt Refining Company versus Frescati Shipping Company. Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The basic issue in this case is what ought to be the default rule for what is the generally referred to as safe-port or safe-berth clause in the standard charter party form that has, frankly, governed the transportation of ocean-going vessels for a very, very long time. There are -- the court below concluded that -- based on the language referring specifically to ""staying afloat and safely,"" that this imposed a strict liability on the charterer, my client, who designated that Paulsboro, New Jersey, would be the port of entry for these particular goods. That is an extraordinary interpretation under the circumstances in which my client is now facing well in excess of $140 million in -- in -- in an award based solely on an accident that was, candidly, unknown and unknowable at the time that the designation was made and, candidly, at any time until the actual allision occurred. The question then is, is there a different or better or more sensible default rule that the Court might turn to? And it seems worth spending a second and just focusing on the exact language of this clause, which is at the appendix to the Petitioners' brief at 8a. ""The vessel shall discharge at any safe place or wharf"" -- that, of course, says nothing about any obligations of any of the parties -- ""which shall be designated and procured by the charterer"" -- so that is the obligation of my client to designate and -- and procure the space -- ""provided that the vessel can proceed thereto, lie at, and depart therefrom always safely afloat, any lighterage being at the expense, risk, and peril of the charterer."" And it seems to me the difficulty with saying that this is an unlimited source of liability on a strict liability theory is that why would you identify lighterage as the specific remedy to be worried about unless what you're really concerned about is, has the charterer made essentially a safe choice as far as everyone can tell, and then, when the captain gets there, if for whatever reason the captain in his or her judgment decides it's not a safe choice and decides to go off into another port or to offload some portion at the expense and the risk, all of that is then imposed upon the charterer. Mr. Phillips, this has been the rule for some time in the Seventh Circuit -- in the Second Circuit -- Second Circuit. -- including an opinion by Henry Friendly.
And isn't this something that the parties can adjust to? If they know what the rule is, they can adjust to it and insure accordingly? That's -- that is precisely what the Court said about Norfolk Southern versus James Kirby in terms of how do you interpret the contract.
Obviously, it will always be possible to for that, Orduna would not even have existed.
And the reason Orduna has not been a problem, the reason it has not been regarded as a lot of authority on either side, is that in the wake of Orduna, all these contracts still call for arbitration and litigation in New York and London.
That's why there are no follow-on -- I got that.
I knew Gilmore and Black in '75 and I should have asked them. (Laughter.) Yes.
Poor foresight on your end.
You could have asked them about the poison ivy.
But -- but -- I mean, Mr. Goldstein, would it be fair to say Gilmore and Black were incredibly smart men? There are two kinds of treatises in the world.
There's the kind of treatise that just sets out the law.
And there's the kind of treatise that says we are incredibly smart men and we could do it better. Yes. (Laughter.) Don't you think Gilmore and Black is the second kind of treatise? I do, yeah.
And I -- they -- they, in fact, say it themselves.
And -- (Laughter.) -- and I'm sure they appreciated all the citations of the Court. But, if you were to actually cite them in your opinion, you would be citing Gilmore and Black says the rule should be X. My point, or I was trying to start from Justice Alito's question, is what actually, if you thought the text was in equipoise, what would you look at, how the industry actually treats things? You would not cite Gilmore and Black against me on that position, on that question. Well, if we thought that the -- the text was perfectly ambiguous, couldn't we say we are incredibly smart people, and we think -- (Laughter.) -- that the better rule -- Yes. -- is the Gilmore and Black rule? Justice Alito, I learned a long time ago that if the question is couldn't -- could the Supreme Court do X, the answer is yes. (Laughter.) What -- it would be somewhat of a departure from this Court's decisions saying that you, in these kinds of cases, look to two things, and that is the industry practice and how the United Kingdom has interpreted maritime contracts. And so, while you could depart from that understanding, it would not be in a contract case what the parties actually expect because it is the case that they can get insurance.
We have cited the insurance policies in our brief. It would be very strange if the insurance industry said we recognize to the charterers you're undertaking this liability, but we just don't -- we just don't like to give you insurance. We'll give the ship owner the exact same insurance for the same liability, but, for the charterers, we -- we just don't like charterers.
That's not true.
It doesn't make any sense.
And it would be contrary to the fact that this has been the industry's understanding for a long time. I did want to explain the lighterage provision, if I could, which is on 8A.
I think what happened here is that my friend inadvertently just skipped some of the language in the contract. And it says at 8A: ""The vessel shall load and discharge at any safe place or wharf,"" and then here's the part that gets skipped, ""or alongside vessels or lighters reachable on her arrival, which shall be designated and procured by the charterer provided the vessel can proceed thereto, lie at, depart, and therefrom always safely afloat,"" and we agree that's don't hit the bottom or hit something on the bottom, ""any lighterage being at the expense, risk, and peril of the charterer. The reason there's a reference to the cost of lighterage is that in the third line the charterer is allowed to designate lighterers. They're allowed to say don't go actually to the port.
Unload onto a ship. On the question of where we get our damages, there is a damages provision in the contract, and it is at 20A.
It's very simple. Paragraph 23: ""Damages for breach of this charter shall include all provable damages and all costs of suit and attorneys' fees incurred in any action hereunder."" They promised us a safe port.
It was not safe.
It was a bad accident.
But, if you were to ask where is the textual basis for his position, where is there a reference in the safe port clause to due diligence, where is there a -- a reference to the idea that there will be no responsibility if the port turns out not to be safe and only if they are negligent? It doesn't exist. And just the last point, Justice Gorsuch, on administrability, remember, there is always going to be a question of causation.
And they agreed that they're liable if they didn't exercise due diligence. So it's not that their rule just avoids those questions.
It just points them -- it just puts the burden on another party. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and, again, may it please the Court: First of all, both of my friends refer specifically to these two forms.
There's not a shred of evidence in this case that any form other than the one that was actually implemented in this case was ever considered by the parties. And, indeed, one of the parties has never been in this litigation.
So the notion that there should construe what the meaning to these parties were with the language of the contract on the basis of a different contract that we have no idea whether it had any input whatsoever into this case -- But those -- -- seems to me -- -- those -- those other -- those other contracts were not a mystery.
They were well-known and in the trade. You could pick the safe berth or you could pick the due diligence. You may have had -- to be sure, Justice Ginsburg, they had the option to do that if they knew about that option, but there's -- again, typically, in a contract case, there's some evidence between the contracting parties that tells you who did what to whom and who made the selections here. All I'm saying is the fact that there are other alternatives does not tell you anything about the contract that the parties understood when they entered in -- into this agreement. With respect to abnormal occurrence, again, that is clearly an atextual analysis, again, by my friends over here.
There is no way you can get from the simple language of just safe berth and say but that excludes abnormal -- abnormal occurrence. You only do that because, at the end of the day, that is the most sensible way to read ""safe berth,"" which is to say it doesn't -- it doesn't make you the insurer against all things that can happen. And I submit to you that if you're not the insurer against all bad things that happen, one of the bad things that you're not insuring against is the anchor in this particular case. It is not a characteristic of this port.
This Court specifically defined objects in the sea, submerged objects in the sea that are unknown and unknowable as perils of the sea, not as characteristics of the port. The Court's already been down this road.
It ought to follow that same position that it took in G.R. Booth. And then finally, with respect to Gilmore and Black, what they say is the text is being way over-read by the prior decisions. All of those decisions ignore this Court's statement in Atkins that this cannot fairly be immediately assumed to operate as a warranty. And, finally, what they said as a matter of both policy and maritime commerce concerns is that the charterer is in the least effective position to prevent the prob -- the -- the injuries that will arise under these circumstances. And it makes no sense to put it on the backs of the party least capable of dealing with the problem because it creates insurance risks, it imposes unlimited potential liability, which this Court has consistently recognized. I'm not saying that this all should fall on -- on Mr. Goldstein's client.
Mr. Goldstein, if determined today, if this Court were to decide today that there's no liability for CITGO, he can go back to -- to the federal government and seek complete exoneration because the third-party here, the person who left the anchor in that -- in that waterway, didn't identify it, didn't tell anybody about it, that's the person who should be liable. We can't find that person.
There are two ways to deal with that.
There's exoneration for him completely because of that third-party, and there's the oil spill fund which would take care of it. My client's already spent more than $100 million on that fund.
It should not be -- it is not an equitable result to impose another $140 million solely on the party least capable of avoiding this particular problem. If there are no other questions, I would urge you to reverse, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-518, the Colorado Department of State versus Micheal Baca.
I note at the outset that Justice Sotomayor is recused in this case. General Weiser. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution authorizes states to use their plenary authority to remove a bribed elector, one who engages in a rebellion, or one who would perpetrate a bait and switch on the people of their state by voting contrary to a binding pledge.
By contrast, if a state wishes to treat electors as free agents, rather than as proxy voters, it is free to do so. In short, states determine how to select electors and ensure that they meet the relevant requirements and perform their duties as assigned.
This means, under Green, that states can oversee bribery as an incident as a power to appoint.
This must include the power to remove an elector without requiring a full criminal trial.
Under my friend Mr. Lessig's position, as a practicality, bribed electors would cast ballots and illegal votes. In this case, the State prevented Mr. Baca from casting a legal ballot, just like it's an illegal ballot if you don't sign it here in Colorado. As this Court explained in Ray, the purpose and history of the Twelfth Amendment reflected the reality that electors acted as pledged agents for their political parties.
And the history of such pledges should be given great weight. As to Justice Ginsburg's point about the importance of enforcing a pledge requirement, it's worth noting people rely on such pledges, which are taken voluntarily.
And as Justice Scalia explained in the Inter Tribal Council case, voting requirements would be of little value if not enforced. In the almost 70 years since Ray, states have continued to enact laws to enforce elector pledges.
Congress has consistently deferred to the states' plenary authority, and no court other than the Tenth Circuit below has invalidated a pledge binding law. Mr. Chief Justice, I would welcome your questions. Well, my first question is to ask if there is anything that General Purcell said on behalf of the State of Washington with which you disagree? Thank you so much, Mr. Chief Justice.
I would only add a slight wrinkle.
He did, indeed, endorse our Tenth Amendment argument.
What I would say on that is the Tenth Amendment is an important interpretive principle because the Constitution gave the states authority over elections.
The Tenth Amendment underscores that point. Would you state for me exactly what you think the limits on the state power to replace electors are? Your Honor, here, I would echo my colleague from Washington.
It governs whether or not another constitutional provision is violated.
The Fourteenth Amendment quite notably means a state could not remove an elector based on race or religion.
Also, the Qualifications Clause means you can't remove electors for the purpose of adding qualifications for who can be President. So, if you selected electors, one of the requirements is they had to be relatives of the legislators, that would be all right? Your them? Because, Your Honor, when, Justice Kagan, when you said there are all these states doing what Colorado is doing, it has actually never been the case that a state has done what Colorado is doing.
That is 220 years of unbroken history.
I think that speaks very loudly if Your Honor is concerned about how to interpret that silence. And -- and -- and so -- Justice -- go ahead, please. No, no, Your Honor. If -- if -- if you're ready to move on, then, fine, I was going to continue making another point. No, that -- that was directed to Justice Kagan. No, I'm done, thank you. Okay. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, suppose Mr. Baca had asked Congress to count his vote and Congress decided to do so.
Would we be here? I -- I -- yes, you would, Your Honor.
There -- there is no mechanism for Mr. Baca to ask Congress to count his vote under the Electoral Count Act that the State has pointed to any mechanism, other than perhaps making a phone call to a senator, the same -- I believe you're fighting my hypothetical.
Let -- let's suppose he had asked Congress and let's suppose Congress had agreed to count his vote.
That's my hypothetical.
Would we be here? If Congress had counted his vote instead of the vote of the replacement elector, Celeste Landry, then no, perhaps not because in that he wouldn't have lost the office. I will say he didn't get a chance to vote for vice president either, so assuming on Your Honor's hypothetical that he had his ballots fully cast, then no, we -- we probably wouldn't be here. Okay.
He didn't seek -- he didn't try to ask Congress to cast his vote, did he? He -- he did not, Justice Gorsuch.
There's no mechanism for it and the State hasn't pointed to one. Okay.
And -- and the damages he seeks are -- is it six dollars? Is -- is that right? Justice Gorsuch, it's even less, it's one dollar in nominal damages. One -- one dollar. So it's a one dollar nominal damages. And why -- why should we exercise our discretion to hear this case when the nominal damages are one dollar, he didn't seek Congress to count his vote, though as you point out, it's unclear whether there's a mechanism to do so, and we have a cause of action that doesn't exist based -- that -- that -- that we are asked to overlook because of a stipulation by the parties? Why isn't that a sort of manufactured litigation that this Court should -- should decline its -- should -- should -- should bother with, with using its discretion whether to decide a case? Justice Gorsuch, because once there is jurisdiction -- and, again, I'll just emphasize that the question of -- of whether -- I'm accepting there's jurisdiction, counsel, but this Court has discretion over what to entertain, and it also has some -- some authority to emphasize the importance of -- of the adversarial process and its proper uses. It -- it does, Justice Gorsuch.
And I think the arguments today and the brief show this is highly adversarial on the standing and on the merits. And the discretion here is because there was a conflict in the lower courts on an important issue and the -- the unique chance that this Court has to decide this issue of presidential selection outside the -- the very contested context of an -- an actively fought presidential election. So, to the extent Your Honor is talking about discretion and not jurisdiction, I think it's well exercised here.
And -- and, again, Colorado doesn't contest that. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Harrow.
How, if at all, should the quick growth of political parties affect our analysis of this case, including how the Twelfth Amendment interacts with Article II? Justice Kavanaugh, the political parties provide the context for nominating electors and the appointment of electors.
But they -- the fact that there are political parties now and were emerging political parties when the Twelfth Amendment was passed in 1803 doesn't affect that the word ""elector"" remains in the Constitution and that electors are people who vote, and all of those words and all of those structural principles mean that they can vote with discretion. And Justice Kagan noted a question about what to do if the text is silent.
And we've talked about various things that could fill the gap there, including the State's authority. Another, of course, under our case law is historical practice under cases like Noel Canning and Dames and Moore and many others, that we looked to historical practice as a gloss on the text. What is your strongest point on why the historical practice favors you rather than favoring -- favoring the other side? Justice Kavanaugh, in addition to the historical practices that we've already discussed, including in the exchange with Justice Kagan, I'll also point the Court to the history of constitutional amendments that have been introduced to try and abolish the office of elector precisely to eliminate the elector discretion that everyone who -- that was introducing the amendment assumed exists. As we point out in our brief, this starts in 1801 with no less than Thomas Jefferson saying: Hey, maybe we should get rid of the office of elector.
It can only cause trouble. And that continues in the 19th and 20th century.
For 20 years, such amendments were introduced by Thomas Hart Benton in essentially every single Congress.
And those amendments were not meaningful.
And the people who thought that we ought to eliminate elector discretion were not writing on a blank slate; they were writing knowing there was elector discretion.
And that would be a lot of wasted oxygen, Your Honor, if -- if there was already a way to eliminate elector discretion and if they didn't have it in the first place. Thank you very much. Counsel, you have a few minutes for wrap-up if you'd like. Sure.
Just to conclude briefly, as the Court knows, the intervention here was extraordinary and unprecedented.
And if Colorado is permitted to undo the human check that has been baked into this system of presidential selection, there really could be a chaotic outcome. By contrast, most electors have been free in most elections, and here we are today, Your Honors.
Indeed, electors retain legal discretion in 18 states, as I've said, and a decision from this Court won't change that. So the question for this Court is whether to approve of the State's novel intervention, and it is novel, and be left wondering how the State's overly rigid interpretation could go haywire in, as we've discussed, the case of death or other unforeseen circumstances, or instead whether the Court should keep faith with the system, keep faith with the Constitution until amended and maintain indirect election, acknowledging that both sides here, both sides have a vision of presidential selection that is imperfect, but the various checks, balances, and separations that our Constitution's drafters and amenders have put into the Constitution, all of those should be given a role in our constitutional universe. And, Your Honors, I -- I think that all adds up to elector discretion. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel. General Weiser, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me make three points in response and offer two closing thoughts. First off, on standing, the payment or non-payment of the per diem fee was never before alleged, and any reported non-payment is not in the record. Second, on nominal damages, prior cases like Smith and Bird did not accord standing on nominal damages alone, instead focusing on whether there's an actual personal injury. Second, as to Justice Scalia's important point about congressional remover -- removal in the case of bribery, it's worth noting there is a prescribed removal process for senators, as Justice Alito noted.
In the case of electors, there's no such process, which means this Court's default rule controls.
The power to remove is thus incident to the power to appoint. Third, it's worth noting this is the first time we've seen an elector who violated a state binding law.
Up until now, including the 2016 election, we've always seen Congress defer and count votes as transmitted by the states. Two closing thoughts.
During the course of this entire litigation and this argument today, my friends on the other side have failed to offer any viable theory on how to address the spectacle of a bribed elector, an elector who votes for Frodo Baggins, or one who would perpetrate a bait and switch on the people of our state.
Colorado's pledge requirement addresses all such harms. After over 230 years of constitutional tradition, my friends on the other side would toss out our nation's state-centered model of electoral accountability in favor of a treacherous experiment.
We urge this Court to reject this dangerous time bomb and avoid a potential constitutional crisis by reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1171, Comcast Corporation versus the National Association of African American-Owned Media. Mr. Estrada. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held in this case that a plaintiff may succeed on a Section 1981 claim merely by showing that race was a factor that was considered in the defendant's decision-making, even if the decision would have made and was made for entirely appropriate business reasons having nothing to do with race. Solely on this basis, the Ninth Circuit saved the Plaintiff's third complaint from dismissal.
We submit that this decision is wrong and should be reversed for at least three reasons. The first is that it is contrary to this Court's decisions, such as Gross and Nassar, holding that but-for causation is the background rule that Congress must have presumed to have been adopted in all federal statutes unless the statute provides otherwise, which we submit Section 1981 does not, either as originally adopted in 1866 or as amended in 1991. Second, in 1991, Congress amended Title VII to provide for a motivating factor standard but did not amend Section 1981 to provide the same, even though it amended Section 1981 in other respects at the same time. This all but conclusively shows that Section 1981 requires but-for causation, as this Court concluded in Gross and Nassar, with respect to the ADEA and the retaliation provisions of Title VII. And, third, it is -- if the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, it would be vastly easier to recover damages under Section 1981's judicially implied cause of action than under any express cause of action actually enacted by Congress under any federal antidiscrimination law.
And, thus, affirming the Ninth Circuit would effectively mean that Section 1981 would completely displace the carefully tailored regime that Congress has devised in Title VII to govern employment discrimination cases. No well-advised plaintiff would ever sue under Title VII in any employment case. Counsel, it -- I -- I wonder if the distinction they're fighting over is -- is somewhat academic.
I -- in the contract negotiation process, for example, there may be several steps along the way, and if at one of those steps there's clear racial -- excuse me -- animus evident and that, you know, the process continues on, and at the end of the day, the contract is denied, it -- it may be hard to prove but-for causation. On the other hand, it's also hard to ignore the part -- the step in which there was clearly evident racial animus.
And it may be a reasonable argument or -- or -- excuse me -- allegation that that animus continued through, even though manifested only at one stage of the process. Well, all complaints are different, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't rule out, you know, the possibility that a complaint may allege such an expression of animus that it could actually imply that the animus continued until the end, such that it -- the complaint does so difficult. -- I'm sorry -- these cases, as you know, are not usually thrown out at the motion to dismiss stage and usually you have the ultimate legal test in mind, and you just look at the facts alleged in the complaint to see, as Justice Sotomayor rightly said, whether there's a way you could plausibly infer from those facts that it would ultimately meet the test for 1981 or for discrimination. And this is a helpful question for you.
Isn't -- isn't that just how it usually works? Yes. Yeah, I believe. (Laughter.) Yeah.
In other words, we shouldn't get in -- or why should we get -- I guess I'm picking up on Justice Kagan's now: Here's the legal test for 1981.
Go look at the facts alleged in the complaint, the facts, and just see whether they would meet the standard. And it's pretty rare, at least in my years of looking at discrimination complaints, it's pretty rare to throw one out at the motion to dismiss stage -- Your Honor -- -- as long as it passes, you know, a pretty low bar. And that's exactly right.
And that's what the Ninth Circuit did if you read the opinion in this case.
The Ninth Circuit says in the bottom of page 2A that the only question before us is the pleadings.
And it says that the standard is motivating factor at pleadings. Well, but -- And at the top of page 3, it -- -- the problem -- -- then says that's not -- -- the problem -- and I'm repeating myself, but the problem is that they were assessing that arguably, as Justice Kagan pointed out, with the wrong test in mind.
If they had the right test in mind, they still might allow the complaint to go forward.
But that was the question presented in the cert petition. But I think all this Court needs to say then is that the Ninth Circuit is correct in saying at the pleading stage, motivating factor is sufficient, and perhaps you want to remand to assess whether or not they applied the standard. Though I think, again, if you look at the top of page 3 of the opinion in this case, that's exactly what they did, was say there's plausible allegations here that race was a motivating factor. But -- but you've told me that we don't even have to do that because you say that you did plead but-for cause. Yes, Your Honor, we did plead but-for causation, but we do not believe that it's a requirement.
We believe that at the pleading stage all that's necessary is motivating factor. Well, that sounds like an advisory opinion for me saying, well, you know, they're not arguing that but-for cause is required, but they alleged it anyway, but we're supposed to forget about that and -- and instead address this very slippery question which isn't even presented under your argument today. Yeah, I agree with that.
I think the only question presented is about the pleading stage. It's quite notable that there was a second question in the cert petition that this Court did not grant cert on, and that was the question of whether or not the plaintiff has the burden of negating all other explanations at the pleading stage.
I think that shows why we're here today and what we're arguing about and why it matters so much. But I agree completely, Chief Justice Roberts, all that is before this Court is whether the Ninth Circuit was correct that at the pleading stage, it just has to be alleged, that race was the motivating factor in the denial of the contract. I know you didn't draft the complaint, but the complaint goes on and on and on with a lot of facts, including an allegation that Comcast entered into a racist conspiracy with the NAACP, the National Union League, Al Sharpton, and the National Action Network. And do you think that had any effect on what the district court did here in granting dismissal under 12(b)(6)? It shouldn't, Your Honor, because it's not in the second amended complaint.
And the only operative complaint before the district court, and the matter that's now before this Court, was the second amended complaint.
And the second amended complaint alleges many facts that would support plausibly that race was the motivating factor in denying contracts. And you alluded to these earlier on pages 3 to 5.
These are such things as that Mr. Allen was told over many years things to do and he'd get carriage.
He did those and didn't get carriage; that he was told that there was no bandwidth, but they then carried eight white -- 80 white-owned channels; that all of the channels that are carried by the other cable companies are carried by Comcast, except for Mr. Allen's channels. All of this is at least enough to allege that race is a motivating factor. But also enough to allege that the NAACP and the National Urban League and the other individuals were in on the conspiracy? Your Honor, that is not in the second amended complaint.
And the only thing that was before the district court and the matter that's before this Court is the second amended complaint. What you're referring to here is not properly before the district court and not properly before this Court. In conclusion, ultimately, this case comes down to two different conceptions of what must be pled.
Our view is there should be enough to allege that race is a motivating factor.
The other side says it has to be alleged that race is the but-for cause. When you think of Congress's broad remedial purposes in 1866, there can't be any doubt that Congress wanted then to open the door to claims with regard to race discrimination in contracting, not to close that door. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Estrada, three minutes remaining. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start with the last question that was asked and the answer given by counsel. I would refer the Court to the -- to the Pet. App. starting at page 54A and paragraph 59, which is the second amended complaint, which is the current complaint at issue, where the current complaint continues to allege that white-owned media and Comcast in particular works hand in glove with the federal government to execute this racist conspiracy. I would further refer the Court to paragraph 64 -- 62, 64, and 65, which are on the pages following, in which the current complaint goes on to allege that we paid off the signatories to the memorandums of understanding. It doesn't name them by name, but those were incorporated by reference and the district court took judicial notice of the MAU. And, obviously, the signatories are named.
They are the NAACP, the Urban League, and Al Sharpton. And so the allegation is that we paid off the oldest civil rights organizations in the court -- in the country to give us cover for race discrimination. The complaint goes on in paragraph 73 and 81 to say that we have minority-owned networks that are run by Magic Johnson and Diddy Combs, which apparently are some sort of artists, and it claims that these African American entertainers actually signed up with Comcast to give us cover for our racial discrimination. Now the period covered by the complaint is 2005 to February 2015, when the complaint was filed. So, in a nutshell, the theory of the complaint is that Comcast engaged in a racist plot with the Obama Administration, the oldest civil rights -- with the oldest civil rights organizations in the country, Diddy, and Magic Johnson. And that -- if that actually in any planet satisfies, I don't know how many paragraphs this has, Justice Kavanaugh, it -- it can have 100 paragraphs, but if in any planet that satisfies the plausibility standard on Iqbal, the civil justice system has real problems. If I could go back to the question that Justice Alito asked earlier with respect to the allegations that are listed in those pages, you know, the thing that I wanted to make clear with respect to the settlement and that I was making clear with respect to the time period covered by the complaint, which is 2008 to February 2015, is that the carriage by AT&T and DirecTV, which are probably the largest in the country, 25 million or so, is -- post-dates the events in the complaint. And so that the allegations in the current operative complaint with respect to demand that they can show by reference to this carriage is one that was by dint of a settlement that was entered during the pendency of this litigation. We ask for judicial notice, again, of the fact that these complaints were all pending in the Central District of California, and this probably had some bearing on the fact that Judge Hatter, who didn't just fall off the turnip truck, granted our motion to dismiss. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-260, the County of Maui versus the Hawaii Wildlife Fund. Mr. Lin. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not about whether the releases from Maui's underground injection wells should be regulated at all but how.
They are already regulated under several existing state and federal environmental programs, including the Clean Water Act's nonpoint source program. But is a Clean Water Act point source permit also required? The question is where the line falls between the Clean Water Act's federal point source program and its state law nonpoint source program. And the answer is in the text.
The text defines a point source as a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, and it thereby makes clear that the trigger for point source permitting is not where a pollutant comes from but how it reaches navigable waters. An NPDES permit is thus required only when a point source or series of point sources is the means of delivering pollutants to navigable waters.
This understanding is confirmed by the fact that it offers the predictability one would expect in a permitting regime, where regulated entities need to know beforehand whether a permit is required and where, in this particular statute, penalties for noncompliance are so severe. It also maintains an important role for state nonpoint source programs under the Clean Water Act. Respondents, however, would rewrite the statute to all but eviscerate the line between point and nonpoint source pollution and radically change the status quo.
In this case, they would impose a new federal permit on wells that have operated the same way for 40 years, during which time EPA expressly rejected calls for NPDES permitting.
There are more than 500,000 similar underground injection wells in the country and nearly 6,000 in Hawaii alone. This expansion of the nonpoint source program and diminution of the -- excuse me, this expansion of the point source program and diminution of the nonpoint source program is not warranted by the text, as is underscored by the fact that Respondents now offer the fourth different reading of the statute to support liability in this case. Counsel, I -- I want to make sure I understand what your test is.
You say that the -- it has to be the means -- I guess the point source has to be the means of conveyance to the jurisdictional water? Yes, Your Honor. What does that mean? That if it ever runs into groundwater, it is not the means of conveyance but the groundwater is? That's correct, Your Honor. The -- what we mean by ""means of conveyance"" is at the point source.
The discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance must carry and deliver the pollutant to the navigable waters. So the -- so any intervention of groundwater removes the jurisdiction of the point source program? That's right, because groundwater is a nonpoint source.
And if the groundwater is -- in this case is diffusely flowing through the ground and that's what carries the pollutants to the plant comes out at Kahekili Beach Park, which belongs to the county. So let's say instead they ran their discharge pipe to the beach park, they paved the land so it wouldn't create any furrow, any ditch, any -- any sheet flow that ran into the ocean.
But they would say it's nonpoint source pollution because it stops short of the water's edge. Now the United States would concede that that is covered, but if, instead of doing that, they went to the beach park and they put a lot of gravel down and they knew that it would run into the gravel and then, you know, go into the groundwater for like three inches before getting to the ocean itself, because the ocean, if you -- if you've been to the beach, you dig in the sand, you get down to water pretty quickly.
Well, that's groundwater, unless and until it's on the surface, and then it's the ocean. So, under the United States' theory, this -- this pipe that then goes into the sand and then goes through a very small stretch of groundwater, that's all of a sudden exempted. So, to use, you know, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart's example about the whiskey and the punch and the flask, and he said you would never say the whiskey that's in the punch came from the bottle, you'd say it came from the flask, well, here, Congress was trying to prohibit whiskey in punch. So if all of a sudden -- (Laughter.) -- you tasted the punch and you said this tastes like whiskey, you'd say, where did that come from? You wouldn't point to -- you'd say it came from the whiskey bottle.
That's how we know it's whiskey. And, here, we know we have whiskey, whiskey in the form of a injection well that is discharging 3 to 5 million gallons per day into the ocean. And there's nothing about the Clean Water Act that would allow a polluter to evade it by -- by -- by -- by pouring the whiskey via the groundwater. Well, I didn't know Mr. Stewart was spiking punch. (Laughter.) But would you say in his extent -- extend his example, that it came from a barrel in Scotland? Well, let's say the whiskey was spoiled in some way.
And I'm not a whiskey drinker and I don't mean to offend any whiskey drinkers.
But, if the whiskey were spoiled in some way, you might ask, where did this whiskey come from? And you might trace it back to the barrel in Scotland, particularly if it's poisonous or harmful in some way.
So it all depends on the context. What Congress wanted to do here was regulate pollution at the source when we can. And the source here clearly is their injection well. But -- but Congress knew about the ground -- groundwater issue and there were debates about this precise groundwater issue, maybe not this precise, but the groundwater issue, and there were proposals, as you're well aware, and some of the amicus briefs go through this at great length, to put in regulation of groundwater, and Congress rejected those. So how do we assess that in thinking about this? Well -- well, Justice Kavanaugh, those debates quite clearly resulted in a vote that said, we are not going to enact national standards to control the quality of groundwater.
So there is no regulation under the Clean Water Act of groundwater qua groundwater. And as I mentioned, in 1972, there was no -- So your point -- your point is that's a separate topic from the issue today? Absolutely.
And the same debates -- Okay. -- they said we recognize the essential link between ground and surface waters and the artificial nature of any distinction. If Congress had wanted to say point source discharge that reaches the navigable waters through groundwater is exempt, because we want to leave that completely to the states, they would have said that in the language of the Act.
They didn't.
In the same way that they said we don't want point source -- point source discharges that could be characterized as agricultural stormwater or irrigation return flows.
That usually happens in the form of a ditch. And they said we do not want to regulate that under the point source program. But, here, what you have is paradigmatic point source pollution that just happens to pass through -- Why -- why are the -- -- particularly for -- I'm sorry.
Why are the states inadequate to do this, and are they inadequately regulating in substantial numbers of states in your view? Well, I think the question, Justice Kavanaugh, is whether Congress intended to establish uniform -- No, I -- I understand your legal argument.
Just as a practical question, what's happening on the ground in the states, are they doing an inadequate job in substantial numbers in your view of regulating this substantial source of pollution? Please. Well, there are examples in the EPA official's brief in which delegated states are regulating those sources of pollution by using the NPDES permit program.
And -- and, as mentioned, Colorado pushed back against the mine owner that wanted to stop getting a permit by using the groundwater as a sewer to get pollutants into -- into the waters. But, ultimately, what we have is a -- is a statement by Congress that you need to have uniform regulation to protect our national waters, which are a national concern. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lin, three minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd just like to pick up where my friend left off, which is with the example of the Colorado DEQ and the footnote in Maryland's brief.
I think that is as, I thought I heard him say at the very end there, precisely an example of how the comprehensive regime works. The Colorado DEQ prohibited that mine from changing the way it was discharging pollutants in order to -- to use Justice Breyer's word -- evade its NPDES permit.
33 USC 1370, the Clean Water Act, allows states to impose stricter requirements on NPDES permits. And, of course, there -- Why are you doing what you're doing? This is fairly traceable to you in large quantities.
The state didn't control you.
What regulations are there in place that do? Your Honor, there are a number, starting with the -- No, no, you're doing it, what's stopping you from? This is not.
So how did you get away with it, and how do you continue without taking remedial steps? Your Honor, I don't think this is a question of -- Not you, but I mean the -- Of course, Your Honor.
I understand. -- I mean the -- the polluters.
What are they -- what is being done to stop them? Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I think, if I can take issue with the -- the -- the premise there, which is that there's something that's being gotten away with here, the -- If they followed -- -- these wells were -- -- all the laws, and they still are polluting, they're getting away with it.
So something failed. Your -- The preventive measures of this law were not followed and something failed. Your Honor, the -- the whole -- even under NPDES permits, point source discharges can include pollutants that are below effluent limits. So I think the -- the mere fact that there are -- are nutrients that are getting into the ocean doesn't mean that the system has failed. And I think it comes back to the fact that, in this particular circumstance, these wells were constructed with encouragement and funding from EPA as a more environmentally protective solution than simply constructing an outfall pipe to the ocean. If I can come back to the traceability point, I think it's also important to note, my friend runs very far away from the septic tank examples, and, Justice Kagan, to answer your question about traceability, there are 7,000 cesspools within 750 feet of the ocean in Hawaii, and we cite to a study in our reply brief that showed that through a tracer, dye tracer study, not dissimilar from what was used here, it was established that pollutants from individual septic tanks were getting to the ocean within three hours to five days. So traceability can be done.
Septic tanks are constructed near the ocean.
And I don't think that there is a limiting principle that would give those landowners any certainty, which comes back to the point which I think is the most important about predictability. And -- and, Justice Breyer, you had -- Why don't you finish your thought. -- you -- you had suggested functional equivalents.
I think it's important to remember the context that we're talking about here.
This is a -- a permitting program that applies to ordinary lay people and would -- would require $50,000 a day in fines. We -- we are looking at a statute and trying to figure out what Congress intended to write to give people that kind of predictability. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-587, the Department of Homeland Security versus Regents of the University of California, and the related cases. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2017, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA and the expansion of DACA were likely unlawful, a judgment this Court affirmed by an equally divided Court.
In the face of those decisions, the Department of Homeland Security reasonably determined that it no longer wished to retain the DACA policy based on its belief that the policy was illegal, its serious doubts about its illegality, and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies. That decision did not violate the APA for two reasons.
First, it's not subject to judicial review.
The rescission simply ended a previous non-enforcement policy whereby the Department agreed to not enforce the INA against hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens. But the decision whether or not to enforce the law is committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion, unless a statute restricts it.
And nothing in the INA requires the Department, a law enforcement agency, to not enforce the law. Second, the decision to end this non-enforcement policy was eminently reasonable. DACA was a temporary stopgap measure that, on its face, could be rescinded at any time.
And the Department's reasonable concerns about its legality and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies provided more than a reasonable basis for ending it. After all, an agency isn't required to push its legally dubious power to not enforce the law to its logical extreme since it undermines confidence in the rule of law itself and it conflicts with the agency's law enforcement mission. I'd like to begin with the reviewability question.
If the Attorney General were to say that he wasn't going to seek death penalty prosecutions because he thought the death penalty was unconstitutional, that would be immune from judicial review.
And if a new attorney general came in and reversed that policy because he believed that the death penalty was constitutional, that would likewise be immune from judicial review because -- General Francisco, there's a strange element to your argument because you're arguing this is a discretionary matter; it's not reviewable because it's committed to agency discretion. But, on the other hand, you say the agency had no discretion because this program was illegal.
In other words, the law requires you to drop DACA.
So how can it be committed to your discretion when you're saying we have no discretion; this is an illegal program? For two reasons, Your Honor.
First, we've put forward both legal and policy reasons for the rescission, so this case is on all fours with Chaney, where the FDA likewise put forth legal and policy reasons. Its principal argument was that it lacked jurisdiction to reg -- to regulate state use of drugs in carrying out the death penalty.
Its alternative argument was that even if it had the legal authority to do so, it wouldn't have exercised it. And this Court found that that decision was committed to policy or stop short of wholesale termination. And if we are remanding in light of the lack of a reasoned explanation, my friend has -- But it -- -- said -- -- it was remanded by Judge Bates or -- or given time, and Secretary Nielsen did what you just said and said, even if DACA was legal, you heard Mr. Francisco on that, I would exercise my discretion to rescind, and then explained her consideration of the reliance interests. So why is -- there's already been, in effect, a remand. There -- there is a boilerplate assertion in that memo of independence, I will grant you that.
I think if we look at the circumstances -- Well, can I just stop you on boilerplate? Yeah. I mean, this is a serious decision.
We all agree with that.
And -- and it was for the Secretary, presumably. And to say in writing, even if it's lawful, I nonetheless am going to exercise my discretion, I assume that was a very considered decision.
Now we can agree with it or disagree with the -- the merits of it, but it seems -- Yes, and I think it's important to look to the penultimate paragraph in that memorandum, where she conducts her collective weighing and she considers those policy rationales along with the legal rationales and say that, together, they outweigh the purported costs of terminating DACA. I also think it's critical to understand the context of this in that -- So your point, just so I understand, I think this is your point, is that the legal considerations, while she said that, end up being intertwined in the subsequent paragraphs with the policy considerations? That -- that's absolutely right.
And this was, after all, in a context of a memo that they submitted to the district court in ongoing litigation intended to defend and explain the prior decision. And I do want to note here that to the extent that my friend has suggested this is a new decision or a new action and has been presented as such, that's not consistent with what they told the district court. The district court said quite plainly, please notify me if there's a new decision. They submitted this memo and said, this is a motion to revise your order with respect to the original Duke decision; we want you to sustain the Duke decision.
And the district court took them at their word and treated it accordingly. So I don't think that they can come to this Court and suggest that it is a fresh decision and every rationale is before the Court.
Under Camp -- In that penultimate paragraph, what is the shortfall in the discussion of reliance interests, in your view? Well, I'm not sure that there are -- there is much of a discussion.
She expresses some sympathy and then ultimately says that it is up to Congress to consider and weigh the -- the reliance interests and the costs. It's not a detailed discussion of the dramatic harm to hundreds of thousands of young people, to their families, to their employers, to the states, to the economy that would arise from this decision. Well, she does say that in a sentence.
If we remanded and it were detailed more fully, would it still fall short? I think the great value of a remand is that -- Please. -- to date, they have not made a decision that actually takes ownership of a discretionary choice to end this policy.
And if they had a remand, if that is their intent, they could issue a new decision that actually does that so the public could hold them accountable for the choice they've made. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. -- oh, I'm sorry, General Francisco. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think I want to focus on three basic points.
First, Justice Kavanaugh, I want to make sure you have all of the relevant portions in the Nielsen Memorandum that I think make this all quite clear.
Page 122a, and I'm at the Regents Petitioners' appendix.
""In considering how DHS's discretion to establish enforcement policies and priorities should be exercised, the DACA policy properly was and should be rescinded for several separate and independently sufficient reasons."" She then gives the first reason, the legality question. Then if you go to page 123a.
Second, ""regardless of whether the DACA policy is ultimately illegal, it was appropriately rescinded by DHS because there are at a minimum serious doubts about its legality."" Further down the page, third, ""regardless of whether these concerns about the DACA policy render it illegal or legally questionable, there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy."" And then she sets out the enforcement policy. If you move to page 121 -- 125a, where she's discussing reliance, ""I do not believe that the asserted reliance interests outweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the other reasons for ending the policy discussed above."" And, finally, when you get to the conclusion on page 126a, ""for these reasons, in setting DHS enforcement policies and priorities, I concur with and decline to disturb Acting Secretary Duke's decisions to rescind the DACA policies."" So, frankly -- But we don't know from -- -- I don't understand -- -- from all of that, we don't know how she would respond if there were a clear recognition that there was nothing illegal about DACA. Her whole memo is infected by the idea that this is, one, illegal.
It leaves substantial doubt about its illegality. If we take that out, then -- the independent ground that you're asserting, then she would be saying, we stand up and say this is the policy of our administration.
We don't like DACA and we're taking responsibility for that, instead of trying to put the blame on the law. Respectfully, Your Honor, I very much disagree.
She sets forth explicitly on page 121a several separate and independently sufficient reasons. We own this.
We both own the policy rationale set forth in Secretary Nielsen's memorandum.
Also, because we think this is not subject to judicial review at all, we own the legal judgment set forth in Secretary Nielsen's memoranda. So simply stated, the fact that we've got alternative and legal policy grounds for making this decision make two things clear. First, it is four square within Chaney under the reviewability issue because Chaney, likewise, was -- rested on alternative legal grounds.
The FDA believed it lacked jurisdiction and policy grounds. And, secondly, it shows how this was plainly and eminently reasonable rescission, even if you disagree with us on the legal issue, because we've set forth separate and independent policy issues for the decision. So that was basically my first point. But even what you just read, General, in that key paragraph where the Secretary weighs the -- the -- the -- the reliance interests against the reasons in her memo, everything's wrapped up.
And we really don't know how she would have conducted that balance, how she would have weighed those two, if the legal had been taken away from it. I -- I simply disagree with that.
When she specifically says that she's setting forth separate -- separate and independent grounds justifying the rescission, I don't think that there's any fair way to read that but by saying that she would have rescinded it based on any of the independent grounds, which brings me -- Look at the independent grounds.
Number one -- number one, ""we should not adopt a policy of non-enforcement of those laws for broad classes and categories."" Okay.
And Congress she thinks agrees with us. Well, I don't know.
Maybe they do; maybe they don't.
But, aside from that, that -- that's a conclusion. Look at the second one: ""We should do it on a truly individualized case-by-case basis."" That's a conclusion.
That isn't a reason. And the third one is a reason.
The third one: ""It is important to project the message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear,"" et cetera, ""enforcement of immigration against all class"" -- that's an independent reason. With respect, may I finish? May I finish? Yes. I'm going to try to squeeze in two points in a single sentence. That's all right. Good luck.
I'm sorry. The first -- the -- the first point is that I very much disagree. All of those articulate the basic same policy rationale that this is a law enforcement agency. They are against general policies that actively facilitate violations of the law. And the last point I will make is, while we don't think you need to address the legality question if you agree with us on any of our other arguments, if you disagree with us on any of our other arguments, you absolutely must address the ultimate legality question because we simply cannot be forced to maintain a policy that this Court concludes that is illegal. So, if you decide to get there, then we do think that DACA is illegal and was justifiably -- was justifiably rescinded on that basis as well. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-161, the Department of Homeland Security versus Thuraissigiam. Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress established the expedited removal system in 1996 for aliens who arrive at our borders or enter illegally and have no entry documents.
Such aliens are clearly inadmissible and have no right to be in this country. Congress reasonably concluded that a full-blown removal hearing was not necessary to make that determination.
Congress was also concerned, however, for -- about the possibility for delay and abuse of the asylum system if every time such a clearly inadmissible alien sought asylum.
What it did then was to provide for a three-tiered administrative screening system to first determine whether the alien had a credible fear -- fear of persecution. Respondent contends that the Suspension Clause requires a fact-laden judicial review of the negative fear -- credible-fear determination made in that screening process. Congress, however, while it preserved habeas corpus, tailored it to the special circumstances of expedited removal by limiting it to whether the alien is eligible for expedited removal and whether such an order was entered. Congress's judgment that that approach was necessary for the control of immigration and control of the borders is entitled to great weight and it is consistent with the Suspension Clause. First, Congress has repeatedly said that an alien seeking admission is entitled only to the procedures Congress has provided.
And it has held for more than 100 years that Congress may vest the determination of whether an individual alien is excludable in an executive officer.
Indeed, it said that a determination by such an officer acting within his jurisdiction is due process for purposes of the Constitution.
And when such an order is issued under this system, that expedited removal order establishes the government's right to detain him. A fortiori, that is true when what -- when you have a situation involving an inadmissible alien who seeks review of a negative screening determination for possible relief from removal, notwithstanding his inadmissibility. Mr. Kneedler, it's one thing when an alien comes and has no protected ground to stay here.
There's no legal right to stay.
And so expedited proceedings are okay because they have no right to be here. But, when someone's seeking asylum, they have a statutory right to stay if they meet the elements of the statute.
So that's a vastly different question of whether the Suspension Clause -- which predated the Due Process Clause by 100 years -- the Suspension Clause, at the time, it was viewed as permitting anyone who had a legal claim to stay to file a habeas petition. I don't know how that right all of a sudden gets transformed merely because there's a second constitutional right to due process. Well -- Meaning those are two different provisions of the Constitution, one predated the other, and the finality era cases were very clear, if you have a claimed right to be in the United States, whether you're on the shore from a boat that's landed me make two points. Is that correct? Yeah, I think it's -- yes, Your Honor, sorry, the answer is yes.
The reason is from the finality era cases, that's the very first finality era case.
And, in fact, most of the cases, someone at a port of entry -- that's Nishimurh/Ekiu -- comes by boat, gets here, wants to be admitted.
The Court says no review of facts, which is the part of the opinion that the government was quoting, doesn't quote the second part, which is undoubtedly there has to be habeas for the -- for the review of the legality. The point I want to point out -- the reason I'm using the 9,000 number and the reason the government's using that is because those are the asylum numbers.
People who come here as a tourist reach a port and say, I'd like to go to Disneyland, they're not going to sit in detention and file a habeas if someone says, no, you're a tourist visa.
That's why judicial review has been available forever at a port, but you don't see mountains of -- of habeas cases. Well, I don't think this concerns -- There's just no grounds -- I don't think the concern is people who come here to go to Disneyland. Well, I -- I think the people who come here and don't have asylum claims or those type of claims and are clearly inadmissible are not going to file habeas petitions.
No one's going to file them because there's not going to be a ground to stay here. That's the reason in asylum cases people file them, but it's all -- it's -- again, as a practical matter, it's not very many, 30 out of 9500, since the Ninth Circuit.
That's the country-wide, 30 out of 9500. The other point I want to make about the burden is the district courts will be able to dispose of these very quickly.
They don't have to review credibility determinations. They're not reviewing historical facts. The administrative record is puny.
In -- in the printed booklets here, it's 28 pages. It's about a seven-minute read.
The only other thing they would look at, which is subsumed within the record, is the few pages of country reports on Sri Lanka, which would have told them if someone's abducted in a van and blindfolded, that is almost certainly by the government forces seeking to persecute Tamils on -- on political grounds. You're -- you're reviewing mixed questions, though, correct? But only as part of the record, which, again, is very, very small. That's very -- that's very difficult in many cases, though.
I don't know that that's going to be that easy. Well, I think certainly there's going to be deference, but I think, Your Honor, even to decide our case, we are -- we are okay with you saying not every mixed question where we have a difference of judgment needs to be reversed. But at least where it's so egregious that you can't possibly have under -- understood the standard, we believe we go back to district court and the district court looks at the few pages from the U.S. State Department reports on Sri Lanka, there is no way that the -- the district court could say, well, the asylum officer clearly understood what was going on. Maybe the asylum officer didn't think he could use circumstantial evidence and, therefore, made dispositive our client not telling him who persecuted him.
If that's true, that's a pure error of law. But either way, at some point, the egregious standard, because I don't think the government gave you a clear answer on even -- and this goes back to Justice Breyer's question to me on exactly what's reviewable. The government's talking about fact-laden questions, but what if they just didn't give you a hearing at all? What if they didn't give you a translator? What if they said we're not going to give you asylum because of your religion, your race? The government is taking the position that even those errors are not reviewable.
That cannot possibly be.
The Suspension Clause -- sorry. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Your Honor. Five minutes, Mr. Kneedler. Yes, several points. First of all, by our count, since the Ninth Circuit's decision, there have been 100 habeas cases filed, and the -- the potential for a flood would be, of course, far greater if this Court holds that there is a right to file a habeas seeking review of a negative credible-fear determination. This Court's decision in St. Cyr referred to review of pure questions of law and constitutional claims, in other words, statutory interpretation.
And the -- the finality era cases really fit into that mold even -- even where they do apply. There's no suggestion that when the Court said that Congress could vest the determination of -- of inadmissibility, much less a -- not passing a credible-fear screening for somebody who's inadmissible, but even -- even for determining excludability, Congress didn't -- or the Court didn't suggest there was an exception for something that might be characterized as an egregious misapplication or -- or review of the facts. We're still going to my basic question to you earlier.
Putting aside his claim, let's talk about a pure legal claim, they didn't hold any interview with me at all. I'm sorry? I -- I didn't -- They didn't hold an interview with me at all. The -- Is there habeas relief in that case? A pure matter of law.
The statute requires -- Well, it's not a pure matter of law.
The question of whether there was a hearing is -- there's a factual element to that.
But there -- this system at the administrative level builds in protections for that.
There's supervisory review.
There -- Counsel -- -- there are forms for notice. -- you're nitpicking.
Get to the point. No, I don't think -- Which is a pure -- -- I don't think -- -- question of law. I -- I don't think there -- Would there -- No. -- be habeas relief? I -- I think the answer is no.
And one could say the same thing in -- with respect to the finality -- So why -- -- era cases. -- bother doing anything? What -- what good is the statutes? What good are the regulations? Congress determined that -- that habeas should be limited in -- in -- in this context, again, for credible -- specifically with respect to credible-fear determinations. There's no common law precedent for this.
There's no finality era precedent for this.
And in that context, Congress's judgment should count for something. Now I also want to point out that, as I understand Respondent's claim -- Shouldn't the Court count for something? Hasn't it been under -- This Court has never -- has never -- -- under -- -- has never -- -- under the habeas? This Court has never said that.
And, again, Munaf -- Mr. Kneedler? I'm sorry. Could you answer, Mr. Kneedler? Mr. Kneedler, let me finish my question. Yeah, sorry. We have the great writ.
It was there to ensure that the executive acts according to law.
What's left if you tell me that there are laws, but there's no judicial review of whether those laws are being followed or not? That's my question. And -- and -- and my answer is Munaf and -- and -- and the 100-year-old precedent that Munaf stood for, where a determination about whether somebody should return to another country because of conditions there is simply a -- It's not returning.
He was there.
The question was a legal one, which was whether or not he should be turned over by the American forces or not.
The court said, even if he should have been, we're not going to step in in this situation. But the -- but the court drew on the rule of non-inquiry, which applies in the extradition context, which is about sending someone out from the United States to another country. I want to make another point.
When Respondent talks about review for egregious errors, I think he's talking about bringing in stuff that is outside the administrative record and trying to demonstrate to the Court that if only the review -- the asylum officer or the IJ had looked at this, it would have reached a different conclusion. That is -- that goes far beyond even traditional administrative review.
But the administrative proceedings in this case, for example, the asylum officer's record are just notes.
They're not a verbatim transcript.
They are there to assist the immigration judge in this self-contained internal review of whether someone has made even the showing necessary for a threshold credible-fear screening. They are not designed for judicial review.
And the suggestion that there would be judicial review in habeas corpus, unprecedented under this Court's decisions or the common law, would -- would require effectively to change the administrative system as well, but Congress determined that the -- that the three-tier screening that it provided and limited judicial review is necessary, is essential to get control of the nation's borders. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1195, Espinoza versus the Montana Department of Revenue. Mr. Komer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case asks whether the Federal Constitution allows the wholesale exclusion of religious schools from scholarship programs.
It does not. Yet, Montana's Blaine Amendment requires that exclusion.
As a result, the Blaine Amendment discriminates against religious conduct, beliefs, and status in violation of the free-exercise clause under Trinity Lutheran. The Montana Supreme Court disagreed.
That court held that barring religious schools from the program did not violate the Federal Constitution.
This Court should reverse that judgment. Even Respondents now concede that excluding religious schools from the program is unconstitutional, but they argue that the court avoided this discrimination by invalidating the entire program.
This is wrong.
The only reason the court invalidated the program was because it included religious schools. And the court's remedy did not cure its discriminatory judgment, nor should the remedy shield the judgment from review. Petitioners brought this lawsuit because they were denied scholarships based on religion, and they are still being denied scholarships based on religion.
If the court had shut down the program because it included Muslim schools or African-American schools, there's no question that would be unconstitutional.
We ask you to reverse. Respondents argue in the alternative that Locke allows them to exclude the religious schools and that this case falls within the play in the joints.
But that would allow the exception to swallow the rule.
As Trinity Lutheran made clear, the rule is religious neutrality and Locke only a narrow exception. We argue that Locke is the exception that proves the rule. In Trinity Lutheran -- May -- may I ask you some threshold questions about Article III standing? Under the Montana judgment, these parents are treated no differently than parents of children who are going to secular private schools, so where is the harm? When a differential is challenged, the court inspecting the state law can level up or level down.
And here it leveled down.
So these would be parents of children going to secular private schools.
How are you harmed? Your Honor, the Montana Supreme Court lacked the necessary predicate for leveling up or for leveling down because they got the federal Supreme Court question wrong. But for getting that question wrong, we would never have moved on to the issue of remedying that problem because it isn't a constitutional problem. But there's another serious problem, and that's the parents are not taxpayers.
Taxpayers are the people who contribute to these student scholarship organizations. And this Court has held that there is no standing to challenge somebody else's tax status.
It seems to me that the Court's decision in Eastern Kentucky is very close to this one, and the Court said you say you're injured because these hospitals are not providing -- providing services to you, but you are not the taxpayer and you can't complain about the tax treatment of someone else. So how do you distinguish Eastern Kentucky? Well, Your Honor, here what's involved is a scholarship reasons and it depends on the state. And, look, I -- I don't see how Montana could -- But aren't you saying -- are you -- I don't know, can we -- can you or could I say this: Yes, race is different from religion.
Why? There is no Establishment Clause in regard to race. What is the Establishment Clause? Well, it has something to do with not supporting religion.
And there is nothing more religious except perhaps for the service in the church itself than religious education.
That's how we create a future for our religion. Now, there's some line there, and that line may be what I have just suggested, impermissible under case law of this Court or it may be permissible but unwise.
You'd like to draw the line.
Explain it. Okay.
So I think that, you know, we haven't talked about the analogies to Locke at all.
I'd just like to say a few words about that, with I -- which I think are consistent to your question. So it's true that there are factual distinctions between this case and Locke, right? Locke involved training for the ministry and this case involves secondary education. So I'm -- I'm not denying -- I'm not saying they're on all fours with each other, but the question is whether that distinction can be located in the free-exercise clause. Because, really, you know, it's true that Locke involved funding of the ministry but I think this case does too, right, the ministry of teachers towards their students.
And I think Petitioners have a somewhat revealing statement -- But this is a -- this is a school, in education, there satisfies the compulsory education laws of the state, correct? That's true. And so that's different from Locke, as Professor Laycock's amicus brief points out in a very narrow decision about training of the clergy. And it seems to me there are two different things going on here, it seems to me. One is to Justice Breyer's question, just funding religion, funding religious schools generally or training of clergy is -- is an establishment clause concern, but this -- it's a separate issue when you set up a neutral benefit program -- police, fire, or scholarships -- and allow people to use those things, allow religious institutions to obtain the benefits of those things on a non-discriminatory basis. And the question in this case, it seems to me, is which side of that line this comes on.
Is that the -- a proper way to look at it? And if so, why does it come on the funding side? I -- I guess I'm not really sure that's the right way to look at it. I think that it's important to just look at the interest the no-aid clause protects, understand whether those are just unconstitutional and whether they apply to this case. So as I said, the no-aid clause was concerned about using government leverage to influence religious education.
And it's very easy how -- to see how that can happen in the context of even a neutral program like this one. The state can just have a condition -- You think that was the design of the no-aid clause, to -- to help religious institutions? Yeah.
If you look at the transcripts of 1972, that's -- is -- what it's all about.
There -- there is numerous religious leaders who came forward and testified that that's the reason they wanted it.
On the floor of the convention in 1972, the strongest proponent was Delegate Harper who was not an anti-religious bigot.
He was the pastor of a church in Helena and he told his colleagues, drawing on his own religious faith, that the no-aid clause was necessary to ensure that religious schools were independent from government. So I just don't -- and there's a committee report -- Well, no one's compelling the religious schools to participate in a program in order to accept funds from the program, correct? That is certainly true.
But -- So a religious school that doesn't want to be part of a neutral program doesn't have to be. Yeah, that's true. But I mean, there's still a concern that ultimately the inevitable effect of these programs is that the government would exercise its leverage over schools. And, look, this is what people were saying at the hearing, and I think that may be a little paternalistic, but I think the state is allowed to have a structural provision being arguably paternalistic in its own state constitution. There's no bigotry whatsoever in evidence from the actual convention at which this is enacted.
I just don't understand how Montana could have done any better than it did, to wipe out its entire state constitution, start all over again, have committee hearings -- I think the other side's argument is the way you can do better is to say: If we're going to give benefits to private schools, which you don't have to do -- to Justice Breyer's question, you do not have to give benefits to private schools or funds or tax credits, but if you do, don't tell someone they can't participate because they're Jewish or Protestant or Catholic. I guess the -- the concern of the delegates was that if you have money going to religious schools, that's going to lead to entanglement problems.
And the way to solve that problem is to have a structural provision saying, we're not going to do it. And that's not prohibiting anyone from exercising their religion.
It's simply separating the church from the state without, again, preventing anyone from going to any of these schools if they don't want to. And it's true that there's a constraint in the Federal Constitution that says that you can't coerce people, you can't tell people we're going to penalize you for being religious.
But if a state has two principles it wants to stick to at the same time then we think that it should be able to balance those principles by invalidating the program. Mr. Unikowsky, if we can just go back to the standing question. You are not at liberty to waive Article III, so why do you think this case doesn't fit under Eastern Kentucky? So I'll -- I'll just answer briefly, Your Honor. Sure. So Petitioners are claiming they personally are the victims of status discrimination, which is the argument that wasn't made in that case.
So we think that they're allowed to make that argument, it is just incorrect on its merits. But, of course, this argument is made in amicus brief.
And, as you say, we're not able to waive it. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Komer, two minutes remaining. Thank you. What we're saying here is that -- what Trinity Lutheran says, the state can't discriminate on the basis of religion.
The decision is crystal clear when you read it that that is what they are doing in this case. They focus on the religious affiliation or religious nature of the schools. They are not talking about what the schools do. They are talking about what the schools are. Second, Zelman has already answered the question about who this program is aiding. It's not aiding the schools.
It is aiding the parents. You have a choice to make about the parents here.
You can either view them as mere inconsequential conduits through which public funds flow to the religious schools they choose or you can regard them, as you did in Zelman, as free and independent decision-makers who are being given the power to choose a religious education or a secular education in private schools. We are not arguing that the state couldn't just fund public schools.
We are saying that when the legislature, when the state makes the decision to empower parents to exercise their right to choose and direct their children's education, that the state cannot distinguish between parents who want a religious education for their children and parents who want a secular private education for their parents. We are only in that area because the state legislature has made, like Montana did, the decision to open it up beyond the public schools.
We don't question that the public schools must be secular.
This Court recognized that in Schempp.
And, as a result, the public schools now must be secular. But at the time these provisions were passed, the public schools were not secular. It's almost -- That is why -- It's almost sort of a illusory state, isn't it? The legislatures can choose to give money or not.
If they choose, they have to do it this way. But the court system is out of it because it can't force the legislatures to act constitutionally under their own constitution. You may -- That's basically what you're saying, isn't it? You may answer briefly. And not fund. We're saying the legislature ab initio might be able to do more than what the court should have done here.
They should have answered the federal question.
They should have recognized that Trinity Lutheran is applicable.
They should have recognized they were applying Locke exactly the way Missouri tried to. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument today in Case 18-1334, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Aurelius Investment, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether members of the Financial Oversight Board are officers of the United States who must be selected in the manner that the Appointments Clause prescribes or whether they are instead territorial officers who do not have to be selected in that manner. The Constitution's text, structure, and history, and this Court's precedents all make clear that the proper focus in answering that question is the nature of the authority the Board exercises.
It comes down to whether Congress has vested the Board with the executive power of the national government or, instead, vested the Board with the territorial executive power. The statute that created the Board, PROMESA, answers that question in a straightforward way.
It -- it sets up an entity within the territorial government.
It gives the Board only territory-specific authority and instructs the Board to pursue only territory-specific objectives. The Board acts on behalf of Puerto Rico as its representative in judicial proceedings to restructure the territory's debts.
It pursues only Puerto Rico's interests in those proceedings.
It's up to the Article III court that adjudicates those proceedings to balance all the competing interests. Congress also instructed the Board to implement a method for restoring fiscal stability.
That, too, is territorial authority. It reaches only Puerto Rico's budgeting and fiscal planning, and the Board must exercise that authority in a manner that protects Puerto Rico's vital -- vital interests. Now Congress did build in protections to guarantee the Board's independence.
Congress did that because it concluded that Puerto Rico's staggering financial and humanitarian crisis could not be solved unless the Board was insulated from the political pressures that caused that crisis in the first place. But Congress also insulated the Board from federal control.
Board members can be removed only for cause, which means that the President cannot remove them based on disagreement with the Board's policies or priorities in implementing PROMESA. When you put all that together, it's -- the Board is in the territorial government, it's been given statutory directives to advance the interests of Puerto Rico, and it's insulated from federal control, it's clear that Board members are territorial officials -- So how -- -- not officers of the United States. Mister -- -- how can that be, Mr. Verrilli? It seems to me that your very argument that it's independent is suggesting it can't belong to the territory and that there's a serious problem that the federal government is creating an entity that no one can control. Neither Congress nor the President can remove this entity for anything but cause. Tell me how this differs from a U.S. attorney.
A U.S. attorney is an officer of the United States.
I think you accept that.
A U.S. attorney is enforcing federal law in Puerto Rico, the U.S. attorney of Puerto Rico, just the way PROMESA is.
And a U.S. Constitution don't apply to the unincorporated territories because they are of a different race.
That's the -- that's the root of that doctrine. Now, here -- I thought the argument was that the Appointments Clause does apply to Puerto Rico, and the question is simply whether it's implicated on these particular facts with respect to this particular agency? Yes, Your Honor. So I -- I guess, again, I just don't see the pertinence of the -- of the Insular Cases. Well, as I -- as I mentioned, and also -- also, last term, this Court went ahead and overruled the Corimatchu case.
In the Trump versus Hawaii case, the Court said that the case had nothing to do with the Trump versus Hawaii case.
But still it was a morally repugnant doctrine that was purely on the basis -- considering the basis of race, and, therefore, it was overruled. The same here with the Insular Cases. And I cannot stress enough that the parties have relied on the Insular Cases in this -- in this case.
That is why it's the -- the perfect opportunity to address them. Now -- Can I ask you a question about the duties of the Board? If the duties of the Board and responsibilities are considered primarily local -- I'll ask the same question I asked Mr. Olson -- do you lose or do you have an alternative argument? Your Honor, I -- I don't think that we -- that the -- the -- the authority of the Board can -- can -- can be considered purely local. I understand that. But, if -- if we conclude otherwise, is there an alternative argument, or is that the end of the case? Well, I -- I believe that there is the example of -- of D.C. judges who were still considered to be officers of the United States in the -- in the Weiss case.
So there is -- there are a couple other examples that this Court could -- could take. Now I would like -- Which D.C. -- which D.C. judges are you talking about? I thought the judges of the D.C. Superior Court and of the D.C. Court of Appeals are not -- are not federal judges. Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm talking about the -- the Weiss case. And -- but still the -- the -- the -- the issue of -- of the purely local affairs of -- of -- of the oversight board cannot stand if we look at the -- the authority that it was vested on these officers through PROMESA. Now I would like to address the remedy because I think that it is very important for -- for us to address that. My friends on the other side have mentioned the consequences of -- of this -- of this case in terms of millions of dollars.
But they have forgot about the impact to the people. What the -- what the opposing parties are asking this Court to validate through the de facto officer doctrine is a certification of the fiscal plan, which is not subject to judicial review, that imposes austerity measures on the people that has impaired contractual obligations, including the collective bargaining agreement of my clients, stripping them of -- of workers' rights like salaries, overpaying -- overpayment, and -- and medical -- medical benefits. But also we are talking about agreements with bondholders, with Dapapa, which is the UTIER's employers, that provides for the payment of the bond -- of the bonds ahead of the salaries, ahead of the -- of the contributions to the retirement system, and that it threatens the mere -- the mere feasibility of such an instrumentality. We are talking about 7,000 labor claims that were stayed because of the Title III proceedings, proceedings that were filed at the sole discretion of the oversight board, and that were -- that were left without a remedy. So -- and -- and -- and like I mentioned, the -- the budgets that establish the policy for the government of Puerto Rico, that it is done at the sole discretion of the oversight board because we cannot say that the government of Puerto Rico has participation. The -- if -- if the Board -- You can finish your sentence. Yes, thank you. If the Board understands that the -- that the fiscal plan, which is the blueprint for all of these proceedings, or the budgets, are inconsistent with PROMESA, the Board can substitute for its own at its sole discretion. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Verrilli. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to make one overarching point on the merits and one point on remedy.
On the merits, I want to go at the sum of each question. I think, if you think the sum of each, I don't think you can resolve it based on effects.
I mean, if you think about it, the effects we're talking about here are not the Board's actions.
It was the issuance of the bonds and then the default by the government of Puerto Rico, the elected representatives of Puerto Rico.
So, if its effect is then they're officers of the United States, that can't be right and it's just not an administrable test. It can't be whether they are enforcing federal law. Mr. Olson raised the Limtiaco case. That case proves our point.
The statute he's talking about in that case requiring fiscal solvency was enforced by the governor and the legislature, who are not appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause but elected.
So, if he's right about that, Guam's government is unconstitutional.
And it also would mean that the D.C. government, from the -- from the beginning until home rule, was unconstitutional because they were enforcing federal statutes. So that can't be right. It can't be based on the source of authority.
They're really not arguing that anymore.
And even if you wanted to accept the intermediate authority point, you -- and try to carve out Puerto Rico that way, you can't save Guam, you can't save the Virgin Islands, you can't save home rule in D.C.
You basically blow everything else up if you adopt that standard, which is why they don't really advocate for it. So really it needs to be our test. Our test is one that's faithful to the text, it's faithful to the history, it rests on principle, it avoids threats to home rule, and it's administrable.
Maybe there are going to be hard questions on the margin and we discussed those today.
This is not a hard case.
This is exclusively territorial authority. Now, on remedy, I think Mr. Olson's answer to Justice Alito's question tells you all you need to know about what's going to happen next.
They brought this suit because they want a different Board.
They're perfectly entitled to do that.
They've every right to do that. But that's what they want because they don't like the way this Board is working out the debt problems. And so what you can be sure of, if we're in the remedies phase and I hope that we are not, but what you can be sure of if we are is that they are going to fight ratification by the Board tooth and nail for years and years and do everything possible to keep this thing in a situation in which they -- they -- they have the hope to get a different Board that will accomplish their objectives. So that's what will happen if we go down that path.
And I would strongly urge the Court not to do that.
If you do reach the remedial issue, then I think the de facto officer doctrine, a perfectly reasonable judgment, but more fundamentally, there is no reason to reach the remedial issue -- Mr. -- Mr. Verrilli -- -- to support as -- -- let -- -- constitutional -- -- let's say it is your test.
But let's also say that the crux of this statute -- there are some other things in it, but the crux of the statute is that it sets up a scheme for restructuring the debt of a bankrupt territory and -- on -- with the backdrop that that could not have been done under pre-PROMESA federal law by local officials themselves.
Why is it primarily local? May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice? Yes. Two things.
First, you wouldn't think that the mayor of Detroit was converted into a federal official because he took Detroit into bankruptcy under Chapter 9. He's still exercising his local power.
Same with the Board. And, second, again, the question I think has to be whose interests is -- is the Board advancing in that process? It's the court, the Article III court, that engages in the broad adjustment of interests here to achieve a -- a nationwide result. The Board's job, as the statute expressly says, is to act on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico and the government of Puerto Rico as its representative.
It's an advocate for Puerto Rico, and that's why it's territorial authority.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1048, GE Energy Power Conversion France versus Outokumpu. Mr. Dvoretzky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If this case involved a domestic arbitration agreement, GE Energy could enforce it as long as it could satisfy domestic non-signatory enforcement doctrines like equitable estoppel.
The question here is whether the New York Convention prohibits that same result for international arbitration agreements.
It does not. The Convention is simply silent about enforcement by non-signatories.
That silence is consistent with the Convention's design, which sets a floor, not a ceiling, for enforcing arbitration agreements and awards.
The Convention says that states must do certain things to promote arbitration.
It doesn't say they can't to do more than the Convention requires. Moreover, Article II, the principal provision about arbitration agreements, is especially short.
It is not a comprehensive scheme that displaces all sovereign authority to enforce domestic laws about arbitration agreements. All relevant sources of meaning understand the Convention this same way.
Other contracting states are close to unanimous that the Convention does not preempt domestic law allowing non-signatory enforcement.
The United States, the Restatement, UNCITRAL, and leading commentators agree.
In allowing doctrines like equitable estoppel serves the Convention's overriding purpose, to overcome widespread resistance to arbitration. The Eleventh Circuit nevertheless interpreted the definition of ""agreement in writing"" to preclude non-signatory enforcement. This Court should not make the United States an outlier by adopting that position. Article II(2) just specifies the kinds of agreements that states at a minimum must recognize.
It doesn't limit who can enforce them. Respondents themselves don't defend the Eleventh Circuit's signature-based rule. They concede that all kinds of non-signatory enforcement doctrines, including even some kinds of equitable estoppel, are okay.
Just not the particular type of equitable estoppel here. That incoherent project of parsing some non-signatory enforcement doctrines from others has no basis in any of the tools of treaty interpretation. Mr. Dvoretzky, if -- if you and I have an agreement to arbitrate, and even if you tell me, you know, I -- I might have Mr. Hacker do most of the work under it, and I just want to make that clear to you, and then you do hire Mr. Hacker to do all the work in it. He can't be compelled to arbitrate with me if I don't like the quality of his work, right? He's not a signatory to our arbitration agreement.
Maybe he doesn't even know about it. But the fact that you and I think -- no, you're going to get him to do it, and we think we're going to arbitrate all our disputes, he's not bound to arbitrate? I think whether he could arbitrate would depend on the domestic doctrine about non-signatory enforcement.
And on the facts that you've posited, I think on an equitable estoppel theory, if you were to sue him, rather than me, for -- for claims that are intertwined with our contract, the contract that you and I have, under an equitable estoppel theory, he could be compelled to arbitrate. That was the same stretch, or you could say that is not a ceiling but it does pick up domestic law on this matter.
And, by and large, when the domestic law allows a non-signatory to enforce an arbitration clause against a signatory, this doesn't forbid it. Now, what about that approach? I think the problem is what you -- what was described earlier as a choice-of-law problem, which I think your international commentators recognize that the law has to be governed by universally recognized international law principles because if you open up the door to domestic law on what seems like a, gee, that seems an eminently fair situation and say domestic law gets to decide who gets to enforce, that creates a huge problem under the Convention because then states can begin subjecting parties to arbitration, absent their consent, unwilling parties when the Convention clearly intends to be -- All right. -- required to -- He had a list about a thousand miles long, it seemed to me, of authorities, cases, professors, and others who say all these other people have enforced that particular sentence in a way that it allows at least some, perhaps not all, of those who are hard to call privities to enforce under certain circumstances and this is one.
What do you say? The circumstance in which it is widely and I would say essentially universally recognized is only one.
It's not the one Your Honor describes.
It is the situation where a party begins or has even completed arbitration and then -- or an entity begins or completes arbitration and then later says I wasn't a party, I don't want to be subject to the results of this arbitration. That's a situation where courts, international decisions have recognized they can be held to it but it is not really an estoppel/contract doctrine.
What Justice Alito's opinion in the case in Minmetals described it as is really a waiver doctrine or forfeiture doctrine. That's how the English Court in Peterson Farms described it, that's how the UK High Court in Dallah described it.
It's really forfeiture or waiver.
It's not some opening the door to all kinds of situations when it sort of seems fair to let an unwilling party to force an unwilling party to arbitrate. And think about the consequences of doing that.
The Todd case that I believe Justice Ginsburg raised exemplifies the problems that you have if you just say -- if -- if it's connected to the contract in some way. Remember we had the earlier discussion from the earlier argument, the word ""involves"" can, you know, extend to the -- the limits of the universe.
Well, so can something that's related to the -- you know, to a contract can extend to no limit. And that's what happened in the Todd case where a sailor was injured while working on a ship, couldn't recover against his immediate employer because the employer went bankrupt or in some way couldn't -- wouldn't pay the employer for his personal injuries.
And so he went against the employer's principal, the guarantor, and the guarantor said: Well, your claim for injury on a ship is connected to this contract I have with the -- the -- the ship owner.
And that contract has an arbitration agreement. And so you have to arbitrate with me overseas over your personal injury. That's exactly the problem with opening the door to U.S. modern equitable estoppel that is divorced from the contract terms and divorced from a situation when you're really talking about a waiver where somebody has engaged in arbitration. That's the limited circumstance.
It's not any kind of gerrymander.
It's simply adhering to the same text of the Convention, which for Convention-governed cases requires a written agreement and limits enforcement of the written agreement to the parties to the agreement. Let me make one other point about the language of Article II, paragraph 3.
Justice Kagan's absolutely correct that ""parties,"" the second use of ""parties,"" pretty clearly is referring to the parties to the agreement.
If there is any doubt about that, look at the Spanish versions of the Convention, look at the French versions of the Convention, which you'll find at paragraphs or pages 11A and 20A of our brief. It actually says ""of them."" It doesn't say ""of the parties."" It says ""of them,"" immediately referring back to the parties to the written agreement. So there is really no ambiguity whatsoever there.
This, unlike FAA Section 3 addressed in Andersen limits enforcement to the parties to the written agreement. That's only in Convention-governing cases, Justice Gorsuch.
The point is it's possible for a state to adopt a separate law, like Peru did, and subject parties to arbitration, unwilling parties to arbitration on whatever terms a state feels like. That's not what the United States has done.
And the consequence of doing that is that you lose the automatic enforcement benefits, virtually automatic enforcement benefits promised by Article V. The last two points that I would make are recall that extension to non-parties, all the commentators, I think the United States too, says the extension of an arbitration agreement to non-parties is supposed to be rare.
It's supposed to be the exception that you almost never see. Under the doctrine GE wants you to adopt under U.S. law or under international law, essentially all subcontractors would suddenly be able to arbitrate, even absent a written agreement with the subcontractor because basically a claim between the subcontractor and the principle is in some way going to be connected to -- to involve the contract. So you completely erase the idea that this kind of enforcement is supposed to be rare, supposed to be -- be the exception, essentially be the rule in all construction cases. The other point I would remind the Court about its own decision in the Scherk case. It says the purpose of the Convention is to ""unify the standards"" for recognizing agreements and enforcing awards.
I submit, Your Honors, there is only one way to make the standards uniform and that is to respect, adhere to, and enforce the uniform textual words of the Convention. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Dvoretzky. Thank you.
If I could, let me make three points and then suggest possible ways to resolve this case. First, there's an international consensus in favor of non-signatory enforcement generally.
And there are numerous international cases that allow non-signatory enforcement on facts like these. The Titan Unity case from Singapore, there are cases from France and Switzerland, all of these are very similar.
You have a situation where A contracts with B and C actually performs the contract.
And in those situations because C is involved in performing A and B's contract, C can enforce the arbitration agreement if sued by one of the parties to the contract. So Singapore, France, Switzerland and other case -- cases cited in the briefs. Justice Sotomayor, you were looking for a limiting principle.
I think there are limiting principles to equitable estoppel under domestic law but the Convention just doesn't speak to them. Third, Mr. Hacker argues that Congress in effect adopts -- I'm sorry? What are they? It would depend on the contours of state law, but presumably state law would not allow you to tag a random person on the street with no connection to the contract and say you're equitably estopped.
There has to be a factual basis for the estoppel.
And here there is for the reasons that we have been discussing. Mr. Hacker argues that Congress adopted the Convention as both a floor and a ceiling for U.S. law.
That's simply not what Congress did in Chapter 2. It created federal jurisdiction where the agreement falls under the Convention, and then under 9 U.S.C. 206, if you have an agreement that falls under the Convention, a federal court exercising its jurisdiction can compel arbitration. It would do so by looking to domestic principles about when enforcement is proper. So in terms of how this case can be resolved, there's -- the narrowest possible way, is to simply hold that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to -- to apply a signatory requirement, at Petition Appendix 15A to 16A, the Eleventh Circuit recounts the district court's finding that we were parties but says the reason we can't enforce is that we didn't actually sign. I think that's demonstrably wrong and the narrowest possible way is to send it back for that reason.
If the Court wants to provide additional guidance, there are two ways to do that, I think.
One is to hold that the Convention provides a floor, not a ceiling.
I think that that follows from the text of the Convention, and also from international understanding. The second? The second way to resolve it, as Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, the term parties in Article II(3) is undefined. Domestic law fills that gap, as it does for many other things under the Convention, terms like ""null and void,"" ""incapable of being performed."" Those are not defined by the Convention but the Convention looks to domestic law, as it does for parties. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1150, Georgia versus Public.Resource.Org, Inc. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eleventh Circuit held that annotations to Georgia's official code are categorically ineligible for copyright protection.
That holding conflicts with a straightforward application of the Copyright Act's text and this Court's precedents. Starting with the statute, Sections 101 and 103 of the Act expressly provide that annotations are copyrightable derivative works. Nothing in the Act supports stripping Georgia's annotations of copyright protection merely because they were prepared by a contractor on behalf of a state agency. Therefore, the crux of the parties' dispute is whether this Court's 19th-century precedents support a decision different from the one that would be reached by applying standard interpretive principles to the Copyright Act's plain text.
They do not. In fact, those decisions strongly favor Georgia.
Together, they hold that while judicial opinions are not copyrightable, annotations added to opinions by a court's official reporter are copyrightable works of authorship. Similarly, while statutory text is not copyrightable, annotated research references are eligible for copyright protection, even if they appear in an official code book like the OCGA. As a diverse coalition of states has explained, affirming the decision below would scuttle numerous states' regimes for publishing annotated official codes.
Absent direction from Congress, this Court should not extend a judge-made doctrine to override the systems established by numerous states' democratically elected governments. I invite questions.
But as a diverse -- so PRO's case rests heavily on an expansive interpretation of just a few sentences of this Court's 1888 Banks decision.
But the Banks case really just explained its rationale in a single sentence, and that sentence says that the whole work done by the judges constitutes the authentic exposition and interpretation of the law, which is binding on every citizen and is thus free for publication to all. So we read that sentence as establishing the principle that a work is not copyrightable if it is of a type that can serve as a vehicle for establishing binding law. What do you understand the significance to be of the fact that these annotations, the references are official? I -- Does that -- does that give them more weight when they're cited to the court? No.
And I think that the thing that's official is the code.
So it's the Official Code of Georgia. Whether the -- the -- whatever the additional material is included in -- It does appear in the same publication.
That's correct.
And I don't think that that makes a difference for purposes of copyright under this Court's precedent. And I think that that's clear from Wheaton and Callaghan.
So, in both of those cases, the Court said that a court-appointed official reporter could hold copyright in annotations that appeared in the reporter volumes.
So this case is really just the legislative analogue of Callaghan. In Callaghan, the Court held that the official reporter could hold copyright in things like headnotes at the top of a decision.
And if you look at the judicial decision does or supervises the substance of what Lexis does? Well, so there's a couple of things in the publication manual that set forth how Lexis is supposed to communicate with the state, and it requires sending them memos with bracketing around what the new material is, Xeroxing the pages on which any ALR notes or opinions of the attorney general might be deleted and pointing them out for state approval. The publication manual also highlights situations in which the state is likely to tell them what kind of editor's note to create surrounding complicated amendments or the like. So the Commission is involved, but we don't have -- because the case was decided on summary judgment, we just don't have a record of how often this -- the Commission actually -- The -- I just thought of a possible -- this should shed a lot of light in a number of areas.
One of those areas is only applicable to some judges.
Some judges do look at legislative history.
So, for those who do look at legislative history, a committee report has significance.
All right? Now take the same words and imagine that a senator, long afterwards, came into court and testified that's what we meant.
Would we give that senator weight? No.
Or suppose that the committee met after it was passed.
That's called post-enactment legislative history.
Does that have some weight? Usually very little. And that's because that isn't normally their job.
That isn't normally part of the lawmaking process.
Thinking of that analogy, it seems to me that your case lies somewhere between the official post-enactment legislative history and, over here, the senator walking into the courtroom and just saying, that's what I meant. Now is that fair? Because I don't think you like me thinking that way. Oh, I'm comfortable -- You are? -- with you thinking that way.
And I think that that's one of the main points I've been trying to make here.
There is a difference between being worth very little but nonetheless being official, authentic state legal resource, and being worth nothing because you're not an authentic state legal resource. It's not even the senator walking in and testifying, right? What we need you to compare this to is somebody from the New York Times walking in and testifying that this is what people had in mind when they enacted this statute. That's not good for anything because it's not a state legal resource.
It doesn't speak in the -- in the voice of the state.
And you can disagree about how much weight to give something that is nonetheless an authentic state legal resource, but that's the thing that makes the difference. And that, again, is the difference between these cases and Howell and Wheaton. Howell and Wheaton were allowed to add whatever they wanted. Presumably, a certified copy of the committee report would not be post hoc. Whether -- I think the point I was trying to make is post hoc or not might affect how much weight you want to give it, but the fact that it's a certified committee report is the thing that really makes the difference. Now I -- I understand Justice Ginsburg's question because I do think there's -- the comments troubled me, taking the government and Petitioners' side, the editorial notes trouble me, but most of the references in the notes are just to judicial decisions and/or general research matters. If it were limited just to that, is that -- why can't the state -- I -- I'll just give you -- -- this is what -- Yeah.
I'll try to give you the best example we could find.
In one of the state cases that cites a judicial annotation, what happened was a lawyer from Florida didn't file a response to a motion for summary judgment, because he looked up the statute, and the statute says there's going to be a hearing in 30 days; you can file something up until the hearing. Turns out that there's a rule that says, no, you have to file a response or else it might be deemed forfeited.
And the court is deciding whether his failure to file a response is excusable neglect.
And the court says: Well, if you look at the annotations to this statute, it discloses the existence of Rule 6.3, which is not inconsistent with the statute. And this is what happens when you have a state legal manual like the OCGA that has official annotations in it.
Courts will find ways and regular people will find ways to attribute importance to things that are difficult to use for judicial purposes but sometimes will. And the reason they do that is because this is a legal work that speaks in the voice of the state and not just the bare work of someone who happens to be a legal editor at Westlaw or something like that. But that would be a mistake, right? I mean, isn't that -- it would be a mistake to attribute the significance to it. I don't know if it would be a mistake or not. Under -- under state law, it would be a mistake. I mean, what -- what they did was attribute significance to the fact that you could find it there in the manual, when they were trying to figure out -- But, under state law -- -- what would be -- -- isn't that -- that's wrong. Well, no, the state law would say that it would be wrong in construing the meaning of that statute, but it isn't necessarily wrong for figuring out what's excusable neglect, right? Whether it's good lawyering or bad lawyering, not to look at the annotations in the OCGA isn't governed by the statute.
The statute doesn't say -- Section 1-1-1 doesn't say anything about that. Well, but it would also be pertinent to the question of excusable neglect to look at what, you know, all the treatises said.
I mean, if I'm writing an opinion about whether the lawyer should have known that, I would say every -- all the treatises about Georgia law, you know, highlight the fact that you've got to file a response. I -- I think you and I may have different instincts about that.
I think it would be more appropriate for a judge to say, well, look, in the official state legal code, there are annotations that point to the rule that you neglected.
And I think that's more persuasive.
That's different than saying, well, if you happen to look at the unofficial codification that Westlaw does, there's an indication that that rule exists.
That's the difference. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Johnson. I want to start briefly by talking about the different portions of the OCGA, things like editors' notes. We talked in our brief about why the editors' notes should be copyrightable, why the Dominiak case that my friend on the other side just was describing doesn't undermine our copyright claim. But I think the crucial point on this is that PRO copied the entirety of the OCGA, including the judicial decision summaries that I think are clearly copyrightable under Wheaton and Callaghan. So PRO has to run the table on all portions of the OCGA to get an affirmance here, and I just don't think that they can. The PRO's main argument seems to be that the fact that the OCGA is official means that it cannot be copyrightable.
And I just don't think that that's consistent with history or this Court's precedents. Again, going back to Wheaton and Callaghan, you had official court reporters holding copyright in annotations.
And given that those were government officials, I just don't think that it can make a difference here that the state is the one holding the copyright. I think that this case is the legislative analogue of Wheaton and Callaghan. But I think it's also important to look at the history of the Copyright Act.
So the Copyright Office in the 1959 study and 1961 report interpreted the 19th century precedents we're talking about here as holding that states could hold copyright in annotations by state government employees, and then Congress passed the modern Copyright Act without in any way overriding that understanding or expanding the government edicts doctrine. Under that understanding, we win here. And then the final point that I want to touch on is how affirming the decision below would be very disruptive for states.
So about a third of states have the same regime as Georgia. They claim copyright in annotations to an annotated official code by commercial publishers. So affirming the decision below would blow up those regimes. There are at least two additional states that claim copyright in annotations by state government employees and five other states where the commercial publisher holds the copyright in the annotated official code.
Those regimes would probably also fall if the court's decision below was affirmed. So I think that statutory text and precedent compel a decision for Georgia here. Any innovations on the government edicts doctrine should come from Congress, not the courts.
The Court should reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-776, Guerrero-Lasprilla versus Ovalles and Attorney General Barr. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section (2)(D) provides for review of questions of law decided by the Board of Immigration Appeals.
I'll start with where we and the government agree.
At minimum, courts may review whether the Board identified the proper legal standard.
The government agrees. For this review to be meaningful and not just a requirement of correct boilerplate, courts must determine whether the government used the proper standard.
Again, the government agrees.
Review extends to whether ""the Board actually used the wrong standard."" Despite acknowledging this, the government fails to distinguish how reviewing whether the Board actually used the correct standard is different than reviewing whether the Board correctly applied that standard.
In our view, these inquiries are effectively the same. They use the same tool, applying the correct legal standard to the facts. To the extent there is a difference, the government does not provide a test for telling them apart.
Jurisdictional rules need to be clear, but the government does not explain how courts decide whether the Board actually used the correct standard. Our rule is clear.
There is no judicial review over historical facts, but there is review over their legal significance.
The Court should adopt this construction for three reasons. First, it accords with the essential premise of judicial review which the statutory text has unmistakably established.
Second, it is necessary for Congress to have fully responded to St. Cyr.
And, third, it is a clear rule which is crucial to establish the boundaries of jurisdiction. Turning to what Congress needed to do in order to fully respond to St. Cyr, there are at least four separate points that illustrate Congress had to create jurisdiction for the application of law to fact. Well, before you get to that, I wonder if you have not read too much into the government's statement that a -- that under their theory, it would be permissible for a court to review not just whether the -- the -- the Board articulated the right theory but whether it actually used the right theory. When I read that, I thought what they were saying was that review would extend to those perhaps rare situations where, although it was in response to your argument that if the -- if the -- if the right standard was merely mentioned, that would be sufficient.
And I thought they were just saying that if it was clear that even though the right standard was mentioned, you could see that that was not at all what was being done, that there would be review there. So I thought that was a very narrow exception.
So the -- the difference between what I understood them to be arguing and your position was considerably larger than what you suggested to start out. Well, as Your Honor suggests, I think the government does agree that if the -- the decision of the Board on the face invokes the correct standard, but a reasonable read questions of law to include every mixed question of law and fact.
And what that's done is that it's gutted the application of the discretionary denial bar, because virtually everything that you can call an exercise of discretion you can also describe as involving the application of law to fact. And if questions of law are an exception to that bar, then you're -- you're not really left with -- with much that's -- that's protected from review.
So I -- I don't think that's a solution to -- to -- to trying to make this meaningful. I did want to mention, too, the -- the administrative -- administrability issue with Petitioners' position.
They would have this Court tell -- have courts of appeals start trying to distinguish questions of historical fact from mixed questions of law.
You know, of course, this Court has experience with that. I mean, pre-AEDPA, this was the regime because factual questions got a -- a lot of deference and mixed questions and legal questions didn't.
And there was a whole line of cases that this Court decided trying to put questions on one side of the line or the other. The line we're proposing, which is a -- a -- indeed, a pure questions line, I think my friend acknowledges is a clear line to administer, and it's one that appellate courts are well suited to administer and they have been doing in -- in -- in many other contexts. I -- I think -- Justice Gorsuch mentioned the -- the lay of the land in the courts of appeals.
It -- it's absolutely the case that all 10 courts of appeals that have addressed the standard of review that applies to the very issue here, that is, reasonable diligence for purposes of equitable tolling, for purposes of seeking to reopen removal proceedings, that determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion when this bar doesn't apply. And so Petitioners' reading would create a mismatch in one of two ways: Either we would be labeling as a question of law something that would otherwise be reviewed for abuse of discretion, or we would be reviewing de novo something that would otherwise be reviewed under a highly deferential standard. I -- I -- I don't think that that's really a tenable position.
I think what the -- what those cases teach us is that the issue here is at the very least a primarily factual mixed question. Mr. Liu, on that, the way I -- I worked my way through it, and I want to give you a shot at it, is to say that when we have the abuse of discretion standard review, we often mean really two things.
One can abuse the discretion by a clear error of fact finding, and one can abuse one's discretion by misapplying the law. And both of those can be abuses of discretion.
I -- I see it breaking down into -- into those two camps.
And when I'm applying the abuse of discretion -- when I used to apply the abuse of discretion standard review, and the facts were agreed upon, it then became in my mind a legal question much as it would at summary judgment or 12(b)(6), whether these facts, as given, rise to the level that the law requires. Now I -- I know you don't agree with that, so have your shot at it. Well, I think that inquiry is still -- requires a -- a great deal of exercise of judgment on behalf of whoever is conducting the inquiry.
You are taking in all the historical facts.
You're looking at them as a whole.
You're balancing one against the other.
There are judgments made throughout the process. So, you know, you might -- you might label it one thing or the other.
But I think when you get down to what the actual nature of the inquiry is, it is one that's bound up with the facts of the case. And I think the teaching of this Court's opinion in Lakeridge is that there is a part of a mixed question where you can't unwind the factual and the legal parts, that is, there is a part where they are so intertwined that the best you can say is, well, this is either primarily factual or primarily legal. It's those mixed questions that I don't think Congress was trying to give judicial review of because, if that were the case, there really wouldn't be any -- any difference between the review that the criminal aliens got and the review that the non-criminal -- You've mentioned -- -- aliens got. -- St. Cyr and Congress was just responding to that.
But isn't it true that the courts of appeals, in the wake of that decision, reviewed mixed questions before -- so after St. Cyr, before the Real ID Act? Well, only -- only four courts of appeals did.
I don't think that's a broad enough consensus for this Court to apply any sort of -- But Congress indicated it was -- at least a committee indicated awareness of those decisions. I don't think that's right. If you look at the passage of -- of the conference report on which Petitioners rely -- Well, put aside that.
Put aside that.
Is it -- go back to the courts of appeals decisions.
They had reviewed mixed questions -- Yeah. -- in that interim. Four of them had.
That's -- that's -- that's far from the sort of consensus, I think, Congress was focused on.
There's no indication Congress was aware of those decisions. And all those decisions rested on a reading of one line of St. Cyr, which, as I said, is mistaken.
I mean, if -- even if you look at the -- at the decision cited in that line, it's Footnote 18, you'll see that each of the sources cited involves a pure question of law that is a question of statutory construction. So I don't think the word ""application"" can -- can bear all that weight. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Hughes. Thank you, Your Honor. I'll -- I'll be brief. Our -- our first point is that because Congress created judicial review, that review must, in fact, be substantive.
It is not just review over whether or not the Board wrote down the right boilerplate.
We think that's an important starting point.
And when Congress created Section 2(D), it must have meant for more than just whether or not the Board used the right statement of the standard.
It must include whether or not that standard's used. The second point is jurisdictional rules, particularly rules like this that are often implied -- applied, have to be clear. There needs to be clear direction to the courts of appeals as to, at the outset of a case, when they have jurisdiction and when they don't have jurisdiction. The rule we've offered provides the Court a clear test. The government, by contrast, if we set aside its extreme position, the position that would be you look at the boilerplate only, there is no test the government has offered as to meaningfully distinguish between whether or not a standard was actually used and whether or not the standard was correctly applied. Because the courts need clarity, we think the rule that we offer is by far the most suitable and -- and appropriate rule that will allow courts to adjudicate these cases as they arise. Third and finally, if there is any doubt here, I think the presumption of judicial review is quite important.
This does bear not just on underlying congressional intent but core separation of powers principles. The view of, if there's going to be any delegation of lawmaking authority to the agencies, that certainly needs to be clearly stated by Congress.
So any doubt as to how the various statutory interpretation factors and the history in St. Cyr all apply, to the extent that that is a wash, we don't think it is, we think it strongly favors our position, but that would strongly favor applying the presumption and ultimately concluding that there is judicial review over the application of -- of lots of facts. So, ultimately, our rule is necessary to fulfill the promise of judicial review and the premise of judicial review that's undeniably created in the statutory text.
It's also required to be a fulsome response to St. Cyr, as the -- the cases in the wake of St. Cyr, as well as the pre-1789 cases that we identify in our briefs make clear.
There would be substantial Suspension Clause problems if the Court -- if Congress had not in the Real ID Act included the application of law to fact. But then, finally and ultimately, our rule is the one that is clear, that is manageable, that gives a workable test for the lower courts that will be applying this hundreds of times each year to know where jurisdiction starts and stops. And it's the one that's ultimately true to the presumption in favor of judicial review in the event of any ambiguity. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1678, Hernandez versus Mesa. Mr. Vladeck. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this case was first argued to this Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent and counsel for the United States were both asked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on U.S. soil when he was shot and killed by Respondent.
Both said yes. The question before this Court today is, therefore, whether a Bivens action is nevertheless foreclosed because, in this case, Sergio was standing a few feet to the Mexican side of the border at the time he was shot. For two reasons, we believe that it isn't.
First, the fortuity of where a victim is standing does not, in fact, trigger any of the special factors counseling hesitation identified by Respondent or the United States. Most importantly, it is difficult to see how foreign relations could be a special factor precluding a Bivens suit here if it wouldn't have precluded a Bivens claim had Sergio been standing just a few feet away. Moreover, the government's assertion that permitting Petitioners' suit would dramatically undermine U.S. foreign relations and diplomacy is belied by the long history of successful tort claims against federal law enforcement officers, including, as in the Apollon, cases in which the victim was a foreigner harmed on foreign soil, the Court awarded damages, and the diplomatic sky did not fall. Nor does extraterritoriality cut against a Bivens remedy here.
Not only was Respondent standing on U.S. soil when he pulled the trigger, but he could not have known in that instant where the bullet would even land, let alone the nationality of anyone it might hit. Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases. All of this goes to why this Court was right in Abbasi when it explained that there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens as a remedy for individual instances of law enforcement overreach.
And it goes to why, even though Sergio was standing on Mexican soil when he was shot and killed, this case presents the exact kind of law enforcement overreach that Abbasi had in mind. I think Abbasi is a useful place to begin our analysis because, in that case, not only did this Court suggest that there were still important reasons to retain Bivens in law enforcement contexts, but this Court itself actually preserved and retained one of the plaintiffs' Bivens claims.
This Court returned to the district court, rather than dismissing, the prisoner abuse claim against the warden of the MDC. And we think that reflects four of the reasons why retaining Bivens in the law enforcement sphere makes sense.
First, as this Court said in Abbasi, it is difficult to contemplate significant. And why? Mr. Wall -- Because, when you're injured abroad, you don't work it out through damages lawsuits.
You work it out through diplomatic and administrative processes.
And that's always been how Congress has done it. I mean, I think I need to -- somebody to explain to me a little bit the kind of foreign affairs concerns that you're worried about.
And, you know, it's easy to just sort of wave your hands and say foreign affairs when there's been a cross-border shooting. But I think it would help me at least to have some specifics about what kind of situations you're worried about. I mean, here, obviously, Mexico would prefer that a Bivens action be -- be given.
And that's not dispositive by any means. But I guess I'm wondering, what is the problem? I guess the -- the problem is that the United States and Mexico actively discuss incidents at the border, both specific incidents and general policies, right, as they have for years. And, for instance, CBP revised its use of force -- And as they did in this case even while the Bivens suit was going forward.
The Bivens claims does not seem to have prevented Mexico and the United States from having discussions and negotiations about this very incident.
Did it? That's right.
But the question under Abbasi isn't, look, can you show that in every case this is always the kind of thing -- I'm looking for any case. Right.
And what I'm saying is I -- take this case.
We disagree with Mexico.
We had a pair of cases.
In one of them, we thought the agent acted unlawfully. In the other, we did a very thorough investigation, it's not in the record, but I've reviewed all the evidence and would be happy to talk about it, we concluded he hadn't acted unlawfully. Mexico believes that we're wrong about that.
It believes we ought to extradite him, they ought to get their crack. It may believe as a result of this incident that we're not taking seriously our policy at the border.
That's exactly the sort of thing that we have an ambassador and a foreign minister.
We have a State Department and they have one and they talk about these issues.
And there's a -- I guess I'm -- I'm still looking for, you have -- in one state of the world, you don't have a Bivens claim, in Mr. Hernandez's position.
In another state of the world, he does have a Bivens claim. How does that interfere with the United States' foreign policy? Justice Kagan, do you really think that the next time we go in to talk to Mexico and we take a position on something at the border they won't say, how is your representation credible? You told us last time that your officer didn't do anything wrong.
And your own courts, potentially even your Supreme Court, told you you were wrong.
I think it does directly undermine the credibility of the executive branch in working with a foreign government. But, even if you thought I were wrong, you still know -- Yeah, why wouldn't -- -- under Chappell -- -- why wouldn't the United States then say, you know, we live in a country in which courts play an important role in determining whether conduct is lawful.
And that's not an embarrassment to the United States or to the executive branch. Of course, courts play a role, but the role under Abbasi is a limited one where, if there are special factors that counsel hesitation, the court says we leave it to Congress, even if you disagree with me on foreign relations, you still have clear signals from Congress in terms of the statutes it's passed and you have clear extraterritoriality. And we know from Chappell that you weigh the special factors in aggregate.
So the question just is, across all of these things, is there enough here to think that we ought to pause before we judicially imply a cause of action, and we ought to leave it to Congress. And I just think looking at the balance, there's clearly enough to say there is a body that can address these kinds of on-the-grounds concerns at the border.
But it's Congress.
It's not the courts. And I guess the -- the last thing I'd say is, you know, the Fifth Circuit looking at this said, look, the facts are tragic.
This Court said last time it's a heartbreaking loss of life but said this is not a close case under Abbasi. I -- I disagree with Respondent's counsel about some of the hypotheticals, three inches inside of the line or 10 miles inside the line, but you don't have to agree with us on those or disagree whether there is a Bivens to think that once you've crossed the border and you're dealing with foreign nationals on foreign soil, now you've crossed into territory where Congress has never gone. Did you say you disagree, Mr. Wall? I do. So the three inches inside the line, what would be the -- the case there? I think if you're talk -- I mean, so take the easiest hypothetical.
You have just foreign nationals going across the border, right.
Certainly grant that a couple of the special factors aren't going to apply, extraterritoriality and congressional action. I think you've still likely got foreign relations and national security concerns.
I think probably best answer is there's not a Bivens action. And how about 10 miles from the border but doing border security work? I think maybe you've still got foreign relations and border security.
But, again, whether or not you agree with us on that, this is the easy case where all of those special factors are triggered. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Vladeck, three minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me just say briefly that I take Mr. Wall's answer to Justice Kagan's last question to mean that the government has now changed its position from Hernandez I, where the government argued that the inside the border hypothetical would be actionable under Bivens. That aside, I mean, I do want to go back to putting this case in the broader context because I think it's important to understand how we got here.
Historically, the whole way that the tort liability regime worked for government misconduct was that this Court and state courts looked to existing common law causes of action and focused on immunity defenses as the way of calibrating the harm that citizens and others faced when injured by government officers against the need to protect officers acting in good faith, back to Judge Hand in Gregoire versus Biddle. The Court struck this balance by fashioning immunity defenses where the fight would be over whether the officer was entitled to immunity or not.
And for law enforcement officers specifically, this Court has long rejected the argument that there should be any context in which law enforcement officers, because of the frequency with which they interact with average individuals, because of the nature of their interactions, because of the powers they have to search, to seize, to arrest in this context, to use lethal force, did not justify absolute immunity and instead justified a more narrower, qualified kind of immunity for those most likely to come face-to-face with private citizens. Distilled to its simplest, the government's position in this case is that officers in what is self-described as the nation's largest law enforcement agency should have a functional absolute immunity at least where foreign nationals are concerned. And our submission is that that is not consistent with how this Court has always understood the relationship between causes of action and immunity defenses in this context. It is not required by any of this Court's Bivens decisions.
It does not abide by this Court's suggestion in Abbasi that there are strong reasons and powerful reasons to retain Bivens in this context. And it would eliminate the one deterrence that is meaningfully available to ensure that officers in the nation's largest law enforcement agency are complying with the law. Our rule is -- Before you finish -- -- not case-specific. -- before you finish, can you address one decision that the government seems to put a lot of stock -- stock in, and that is RJR -- RS -- what is it -- R -- is it RJR Nabisco? So, Justice Ginsburg, that goes again to the question of whether extraterritoriality is a special factor counseling hesitation.
And I want to be clear, we agree that there will be much harder cases, if, say, for example, Agent Mesa was miles into Mexico, somehow acting under legal authority. But RJR Nabisco reinforces, it does not distinguish Kiobel in its suggestion that the presumption against extraterritoriality -- Mr. Chief Justice -- can be displaced when the underlying conduct touches and concerns U.S. territory with sufficient force to displace the presumption. If ever there was a case, Your Honors, where the underlying conduct touched and concerned U.S. territory with sufficient force, it's when a U.S. law enforcement officer standing on U.S. soil uses lethal force. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-7739, Holguin-Hernandez versus United States. Ms. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 51 tells parties to criminal proceedings how to preserve claims of error for appeal.
A party does so by telling the court what action the party wants the court to take when a ruling is made or sought.
There's no need to tell the court twice. In every federal court of appeals except the Fifth Circuit, this rule means what it says in the context of sentencing proceedings.
Specifically, it means that a criminal defendant who argues for a particular sentence in district court preserves for appeal a challenge to a longer sentence. In the Fifth Circuit, however, a criminal defendant, like Petitioner here, must argue for a particular sentence in district court during the sentencing hearing and must object to any longer sentence as substantively unreasonable after the sentence issues.
That post-sentencing objection requirement flouts Rule 51, which expressly says that exceptions are not required. Nor is there any practical merit to the Fifth Circuit's rule.
In fact, there's no evidence that a district court has ever reconsidered a sentence in light of a post-sentencing objection.
And that makes sense.
The sentencing court will have just heard and rejected the same arguments in issuing a sentence. Recognizing that the Fifth Circuit's rule is indefensible, the government does not defend it.
Instead, it supports amicus -- or Petitioner here.
An amicus tries to defend the judgment below on alternative grounds. According to amicus, a party must identify the length beyond which a sentence is substantively unreasonable. But substantive reasonableness is not a free-standing requirement under the Sentencing Reform Act.
It is simply a standard of appellate review.
And there is no need for parties to frame their claims in terms of that standard of appellate review while they are still in district court, just as they need not frame their objections to evidentiary rulings in terms of abuse of discretion or to factual findings in terms of clear error while they are still in the trial court. Because Petitioner here adequately preserved his challenge to the length of his sentence, this Court should reverse. I'm open to questions.
But, if you have none, there are really two problems. Well, I'll ask -- The defense said -- -- I'll ask -- Counsel -- counsel argued for the preferred -- the defendant's preferred sentence.
Didn't say that anything other than that would be excessive. That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
And that is fine to put the court on notice of his claim that his sentence is too long. And there are sort of two parts to my answer.
The first is that the better reading of Section 3553(a) is that the district court's task is to identify the particular sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary to serve the statute's objectives.
And ""sufficient but not greater than necessary"" necessarily means that there is a sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary.
If one -- if 10 months is sufficient, 15 months is obviously the bounds of what it can do in the jury instruction context, you do have to apprise the court of that. I think sentencing should be a -- a context in which we require something similar to that because of the parsimony principle in 3553(a), because of the -- the significance -- the -- the -- you know, the significant guided nature of the court's discretion and the obligation -- special obligation the court has to explain its sentencing -- sentence under 3553(c). So the short answer is I would not require the same requirement in those other contexts.
The reason we would -- I think we should require it here is sentencing -- sentencing is meaningfully different. Even -- under the Fifth Circuit's rule, even if you don't object, it's going to be reviewed for plain error on appeal.
And I'll ask the same question I asked Ms. Ratner, which is, can you imagine a sentence that's substantively unreasonable but not plain error? Because, usually, when judges find -- appellate judges find it's substantively unreasonable, they're saying, wow, the district judge really jumped the rails there. Yeah. And that sounds -- and that's the common reaction that -- to a sentence that is found substantively unreasonable, and that sounds like plain error. I agree with Ms. Ratner on this.
I -- I -- I think there is some daylight between plain error and abuse of discretion, probably not much.
I do think many sentences that are deemed substantively unreasonable will like satisfy plain error review.
But I don't think the -- It's exceedingly rare for an appellate court to find a sentence substantively unreasonable. It's exceedingly rare. Yes, Justice Kavanaugh.
But I don't think that's an issue this Court should prejudge because plain error review, as this Court has said, is a very fact-intensive case-by-case determination, and so I don't think the Court should just say, well, every substantively unreasonable sentence will be plain error.
It might well turn out to be the case -- Yeah. -- but I don't think the Court should prejudge that.
And just -- By substantively unreasonable, you mean nothing more than an erroneous application of the 3553 standards, right? Well, correct, Mr. Chief Justice, although it would have to be so erroneous that it falls outside the range of substantial discretion that we understand district courts to have at sentencing.
So it's not just it's wrong. And the way it's -- It's very wrong. -- the way it's articulated in many of the appellate courts is very deferentially articulated. That's correct, Justice Kavanaugh. There's one question you asked that -- that I did want to address.
You asked the government of -- what would happen in a situation where we -- you have some preserved arguments and some unpreserved arguments and some of which are subject to plain error and some of which subject to harmless error review, for example. That does come up in other circumstances.
We were looking into this.
It -- it comes up in cumulative error circumstance where parties are arguing cumulative error, there were a number of errors below, some of which were preserved, some of which were not. It can come up in the ineffective assistance of counsel area, where you argue that counsel was ineffective for some reasons but not others. The short answer is it's -- it can be difficult, but courts of appeals have found ways to deal with it.
And the way they do it is typically what Ms. Ratner said, they start by looking at the preserved errors, sort through those to see whether there's any grounds to reverse on that, and then go to the -- to the unpreserved errors. But I guess the point I would make is courts of appeals have found a way to deal with it.
They haven't just said, oh, just because -- you know, because we have this problem, we're just going to assume everything is preserved and -- and go on to -- to consider it. A couple more points, Mr. Chief Justice.
One thing this Court had said in Gall I think is helpful in thinking about this.
This Court said in Gall that if a district court judge determines that an outside guideline sentence is warranted, he must ""consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance."" Well, I think, in most cases, you won't know whether the district court's justification is sufficiently compelling until you hear the court's sentence and the reasons for it.
It's only then whether you can assess whether the justifications are sufficient to support the unusually harsh or unusually lenient sentence. And if it's not, I -- I think it's reasonable, I think, to require a party to object and explain to the court why that's true. And I think that's something that Rule 51 reasonably requires in -- in asking parties to preserve their grounds for the argument. If there are no further questions, let me leave the Court with one final thought in thinking about this case.
I think it's beneficial to consider not the run-of-the-mill sentencing case but the sentencing proceeding in which a -- a substantive reasonableness argument is likely to have the most viability. And that's when an imposed sentence differs dramatically from the guidelines range and likely the sentence that the parties have been advocating before it.
In that circumstance, I think it's important to craft a rule that asks the parties to engage with the district court about the sentence it imposed and the reasons that it gave for doing so. Otherwise, courts of appeals will have to address that -- that -- address those issues in the first instance. The better rule, I think, is if a party believes that an imposed sentence is so excessive that it's beyond the range of choice that 3553(a) allows, they should make that specific argument to the district court and identify the facts and circumstances supporting it. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Ms. Ratner.
I'm sorry, Ms. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The amicus's test is trying to fix a problem that does not exist.
Nine courts of appeals show that the Fifth Circuit's rule is not necessary to the effective functioning of courts.
Not only is it not necessary to the effective functioning of courts, it is inconsistent with Rule 51 in two ways. First is insofar as it requires a post-sentencing objection that is inconsistent with both part (a) and part (b) of the rule, which express -- part (b) expressly makes clear that exceptions are not required. Second, to frame the argument in terms of substantive reasonableness or the other articulations that my friend used, outside the range of reasonableness, abuse of discretion, that's just the appellate standard of review. And there is no need to frame objections in district court in terms -- in those terms. And, second, Rule 51 just says that parties are required to tell the court what action the party wants the court to take. This facts-and-circumstances argument is, as Justice Kagan remarked, outside the question presented.
But just to briefly say a few things, all we are asking this Court to do is to leave it to -- to lower courts to apply the same fair notice standard that they apply in other contexts in this context, and the grounds language that my friend is relying on is not found anywhere in Rule 51.
It is only -- Where do you disagree with the government? Where do you disagree with the government? The -- well, I think the government's position and our position is -- are very close.
I think -- Where is the window where it's not? Where we might disagree is about when arguments are preserved, when a district court has fair notice.
I think we both agree that the fair notice standard applies, but we might find more arguments -- that the district court had more -- had fair notice of more arguments than the -- than the government is willing to concede. So, for example, here, I think they -- they are not -- don't expressly address the public dangerousness argument that we raised below.
But that's an area where we disagree. But, as I was saying, in Rule 46, there is this grounds language.
It is not present in Rule 51, and Rule 51 postdates Rule 46.
So the rule enactors clearly knew how to require that if they wanted to.
But even if you think there is some sort of grounds requirement in Rule 51 that's sort of implied, all that means is that the party needs to preserve the legal grounds on which they are relying.
It does not mean they have to preserve every fact and circumstance. Finally, as I mentioned earlier in response to Justice Sotomayor's questions, this facts-and-circumstances test would mire the courts in very fact-bound disputes. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Allen, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below.
You have ably discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1116, Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee versus Sulyma. Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1113(2) of ERISA requires that claims for breach of fiduciary duty be brought within three years of when the plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach.
In 2015, the Respondent, Sulyma, sued, claiming that his retirement plans imprudently overinvested in hedge funds and commodities.
But more than three years before that suit was filed, Sulyma received plan disclosures that apprised him of the precise investment allocations he later claimed were imprudent. The Ninth Circuit held that those disclosures would not trigger the three-year bar because Sulyma testified that he had not read them and Intel, therefore, had not established that he had subjective awareness of what was disclosed.
The Ninth Circuit was wrong to read the statute to require proof of subjective awareness. Under Section 1113(2), plan participants have actual knowledge of facts that are actually given to them in mandatory ERISA disclosures.
That reading respects ERISA's text and the statutory emphasis on -- the structural emphasis in the statute on robust disclosure by plan fiduciaries and private policing by plan participants. The Ninth Circuit's reading upends that balance.
It effectively doubles from three to six years the period in which plaintiffs can exploit hindsight bias to second-guess investments, even when plans have fully disclosed the basis for those investments, and it introduces arbitrariness and intractable proof problems. Now one way to bring the correct interpretation of Section 1 -- 1113(2) into focus is by considering the provision as it was originally enacted in 1974, and that's reproduced at pages 38 and 39 of the Blue Brief. The original statute provided that the three-year limitations period would be triggered either when a plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or when the plan filed with the Department of Labor a report that included facts from which a participant could reasonably learn of the facts of the breach. Now, if you read the statute in the way that the Ninth Circuit read it, it doesn't make any sense as it was originally enacted because the three-year period would be triggered in a situation in which the plan disclosed to the Department of Labor the facts that establish the breach but not when the -- when the plan disclosed to the plan participants themselves in mandatory disclosures the very same facts that would trigger it if provided to the Department of Labor. That just doesn't make any sense of the statute.
Our reading, in contrast, makes perfect sense of the statute.
And if I could, I -- I will start with the text and -- and, I think, try to take a minute and explain why we've got a perfectly reasonable linguistic understanding of Section 1113(2). And it's this: A plaintiff has actual knowledge of facts actually provided to him in mandatory disclosures because, when the plaintiff receives the disclosure, he has, in the word of the statute's past tense ""had,"" but of these suits are brought for the benefit of the plan as a whole, and a delay of a substantial period of time -- of time can redound to the disadvantage of other plan participants who would have been better served had the suit been brought earlier. I think -- That's the basic logic of having the two standards in the statute. I think Mr. Verrilli's point, though, is that it's impossible to prove actual knowledge under the answers that have been given here, and, therefore, you end up with a de facto six-year statute of limitations, which is very unusual, a long period of time, going to cause a lot of negative consequences, he says, and, therefore, that context means that we must be reading actual knowledge wrong.
So -- Well -- -- how do you respond to that? -- of course, we -- we disagree with Mr. Verrilli's articulation of the policy balance that's at issue here. But just to take the question on directly, there are many reported decisions applying the actual knowledge standard to find a suit is time barred even under the correct understanding of the statute, meaning the knowledge must, in fact, be actual and not merely imputed to the plaintiff as a matter of law. Now -- Well, give me an example where that could be done on summary judgment, a real-world, realistic example of where that could be done on summary judgment. Well, for example, I mean, a common fact pattern is that a plan participant will consult with another financial professional who will explain to the plan participant, you know, the investments that are in your retirement fund are imprudent for someone in your circumstances. A conversation like that would give that plaintiff actual knowledge of the breach or violation if the claim is that the investment was imprudent.
So -- and that's not fanciful. There are cases like that. So it's -- it's not the case that rejecting the rule that Petitioners advocate here would make the three-year limitations period a nullity.
It does have real force and effect, and it has had real force and effect in the many circuits that have adopted the correct interpretation of the statute. And on that point, I'd like to address one claim that Mr. Verrilli had earlier -- Can you -- can you make sure to address Justice Ginsburg's class certification question before you finish? Sure.
Well, I entirely agree with Mr. Wessler's answer on that question.
I mean, in general, the fact that you may have an individualized limitations defense with respect to some members of a putative class would not necessarily foreclose certification of that class, I mean, in the same way you might have a -- a -- a release and settlement defense with respect to some plaintiffs or not -- and not others.
The injuries may be different for members of the class. Well, except -- The fact that there are -- -- if you think that the actual knowledge issue would be satisfied, or requirement, in most cases.
In other words, there -- there'll be few members of a purported class action because most people are not going to have actual knowledge. Well, I -- I think in general, the Rule 23 question would be whether the -- the -- the injuries asserted by the plaintiffs are amenable to class-wide treatment. And the fact that there is a defense that might be applicable to some but not other members of their class would not necessarily preclude class certification. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Verrilli, five minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Three points: First, I'd like to return to the 1974 version of the statute and I -- and in particular to the question that Justice Gorsuch asked me at -- at the end of my opening argument. I think what we heard from my friends on the other side here is that -- there's two things.
First, that the -- with respect to the 1974 statute, the extreme anomaly that I identified is there, that it doesn't make any sense to think that the statute -- that Congress would have adopted a statute that said the three-year statute of limitations is going to be triggered based on the information provided to DOL but not on the information -- I'm sorry, Mr. -- -- provided to you. -- Verrilli, I went back to that statute, and what it says: ""On which a report from which he could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge of such brief."" I read that as potentially excluding those documents that only the secretary has.
I think your -- your adversary was right, that the documents that the individual received could give them reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge, but not necessarily those that only the secretary receives. So, Justice Sotomayor, I -- I understood my friend on the other side to say the opposite, which is to say that it would -- it wouldn't -- there was no need to have any -- any knowledge provision triggered by the disclosures that went to the individual because everything that went to the DOL was going to trigger the three years anyway. And I think, if you think about that for a minute, that blows up their whole theory of the statute, because what they're saying is in 1974 Congress enacted a statute that was actually quite harsh, that the default was going to be a three-year statute of limitations if the information sufficient to show breach was sent to DOL whether you got it or not. It would actually be the odd case that was the six years under that theory, not the normal case. And -- and, of course, when Congress amended the statute in 1987, it did not change the words ""had actual knowledge."" So the meaning you're trying to ascertain is the meaning that those words had in 1974. And so I -- I just think that their whole -- the whole theory, nobody reads as a -- you know, that's all blown up by their -- what they said about what happened in 1974. Now the second point, if I could, with respect to the -- the -- Justice Breyer, you asked about consequences and there was a robust discussion about the class action impact here. I -- I do think what my friends on the other side are saying essentially is that -- they didn't put it exactly this way, they spoke at a higher level of abstraction -- but, basically, what they're saying is here's what will happen in class actions.
You'll just defer the question of whether there's a statute of limitations defense to the remedial phase. And then you'll have trials at the remedial phase of a class action about whether every single one of the class members had this actual knowledge or not based on these kinds of circumstantial proof that we were talking about. Just think of what a catastrophe that's going to be in the class action context. So, in the unlikely event that this Court disagrees with our position on the merits, I would hope that there would be clarity here as to how this -- this reading will play out in a class action context, because that would be a staggering, enormous negative consequence. After all, it does put the cart before the horse because statute of limitations is a threshold defense.
And so the idea that you would do it in that manner I think is just -- I -- it's a catastrophic problem. And then, with respect to the discussion, the colloquy on willful blindness, I understand my friend's position that it's just a jury instruction that allows an inference of actual knowledge.
But, respectfully, I don't think that's the way this Court described it in the Global-Tech decision. The Court basically said, as I read Global-Tech, that -- that it's not -- that proof of willful blindness, proof of the circumstances that would allow you to establish willful blindness, is not proof of subjective awareness, but it's something that you might consider as being just as culpable or that -- or -- or that they, in effect, have actual knowledge but not that they actually have actual knowledge.
It's an imputation. I -- I just think that's as clear as can be from what this Court said in Global-Tech. And so I think the question here is whether in this very different context, where, you know, as I said, these actual knowledge standards come virtually exclusively from criminal enforcement proceedings where you're trying to measure the individual defendant's culpability. And, of course, there should be an inquiry in that situation into the specific state of mind of the defendant.
That's what the whole culpability inquiry is about. Here, you're talking about a statute of limitations.
And in particular -- if I might finish -- a statute of limitations that's designed this three-year period to protect the interests of defendants.
And so it's important to balance those interests when reading the statute. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1323, June Medical Services versus Russo, and the cross-petition, 18-1460, Russo versus June Medical Services. Ms. Rikelman. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about respect for the Court's precedent.
Just four years ago, the Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The Louisiana law at issue here, Act 620, is identical to the Texas law and was expressly modeled on it.
After a trial, the district court ruled Act 620 unconstitutional, finding no material differences between this case and Whole Woman's Health.
On burdens, it found that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions.
At the same time, it found that Act 620 would do nothing for women's health. In reversing the district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit committed two fundamental errors.
First, it usurped the role of the district court and disregarded nearly all of its factual findings.
Second, the Fifth Circuit accepted legal arguments that this Court rejected four years ago. Nothing, however, has changed that would justify such a legal about-face.
In fact, even more medical organizations have joined the AMA and ACOG to say that admitting privileges impose barriers to abortion with no benefit to patients and that this impact is not state dependent. Finally, the state's eleventh-hour objection to third-party standing runs up against still more binding precedent.
The Court squarely held in Craig versus Boren that such objections are waiveable, and the state deliberately and strategically waived the issue in the district court.
And even if the state could get past waiver, denying standing here would contradict decades of this Court's precedent in numerous areas of the law. In short, Petitioners have third-party standing, especially because Act 620 restricts abortion by regulating them, rather than their patients. Would you have done anything different if it had been -- if the third-party standing had been timely raised? Your Honor, we certainly could have submitted additional evidence in the court, but we believe that the evidence that is already there is sufficient to find third-party standing. This Court has squarely found third-party standing in at least four abortion cases that are on point, as well as a number of other cases such as Meyer, Craig, Carey, and the Court's cases have been consistent in saying that a plaintiff who is directly regulated by a law has third-party standing. Would you agree with the general proposition that a party should not be able to sue ostensibly to protect the rights of other people, if there is a real conflict of interest between the party who is suing and those whose rights the party claims to be attempting to defend? No, Your Honor, not if that party is directly regulated by the law in question.
And, in fact, this Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where the state argued that the third parties were protected by the law and in a sense protected from the plaintiffs. I -- I'm -- I don't see a conflict with that. Well, I would say two things, Justice Sotomayor: Their interests are not necessarily aligned.
One is the interest of for-profit providers and not being regulated in particular ways.
The other is the interest of women in their own health and safety. Now, I don't know how those would have played out if the women had filed suit.
I don't know -- Well, please tell me -- -- how they would have -- -- what you imagine. But to give you a couple of examples -- Okay. -- just to give you -- it's not clear to me that women would have brought facial challenge.
Maybe all of the current providers in Louisiana -- How do you deal with this? I mean, I -- I have read the briefs.
I understand there are good arguments on both sides.
Indeed, in the country people have very strong feelings and a lot of people morally think it's wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong. And in Casey, and the later cases, I think personally the Court is struggling with the problem of what kind of rule of law do you have in a country that contains both sorts of people.
Not -- all right.
So, therefore, I take Casey as given. And I think eight cases where you've given standing, I mean, we could go back and reexamine Marbury versus Madison, but really we have eight cases in the abortion area, we have several cases in other areas, and Whole Woman's Health picks that up.
Casey picks that up.
And you really want us to go back and reexamine this, let's go back and reexamine Marbury versus Madison. And -- and you have good arguments. But why depart from what was pretty clear precedent? I -- I don't want to go back to 1789, Justice Breyer, but I -- I do -- You want to go back for 40 years? Well, I think what we want to say is that in none of those cases has the Court ever considered and -- and signed off in the face of a potential or actual conflict of interest. So, yes, this is an argument that has never been in front of Court and we don't think the Court now faced with it should accept it. And if -- General, I know you have limited time.
And I understand the point that the impact of the -- the law varies from state to state, but why do you look at each state differently if the benefits of the law -- they're not going to change from state-to-state. So I -- I -- I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice.
I think the variance isn't going to be as wide as on the burden side.
But take credentialing, for instance. I think the Petitioners would have to say that if you had a state that really did focus on competence and the hospitals really were vetting for competence -- now, they can dispute whether that happens here -- I mean, that wasn't this case, right? Well, I -- I -- I would say that competence is, I think, a pretty key factor in what the hospitals do.
And if you look at the joint -- On -- on this record? I think if you look at the joint commission standards that are in the record, but my only point to the Chief Justice was that however we -- however we think about that, they can vary depending on how the credentialing system works in a particular state. If I can just make one last point on the merits.
I -- I don't really think it's a clear error standard, Justice Alito.
It's how rigorously are we going to review pretty modest efforts. Doe 2 did not apply to a hospital where he used to have privileges and Doe 3 currently has privileges. Doe 5 got privileges at Touro Hospital in New Orleans and just needed to get a covering doctor in Baton Rouge.
And Doe 6 didn't apply to Touro in New Orleans where Doe 5 has privileges.
So Doe 5 did the thing that Petitioners are here saying can't be done. And it's hard to figure out what the basis for distinction is, because the -- the cites they give in their brief, and it's pretty general and pretty thin, to be honest, but when you really trace it back, it seems to be the hospital bylaws. And Touro, as best we can tell, seems to have bylaws that look like the ones that they say would keep people from getting privileges. The answer -- each of those has an answer.
I mean, they say, look, the ones who didn't get the -- did get the privileges practice in OB-GYN practice, and so they had women who, in fact, were admitted to hospitals.
And the ones who don't are the ones who do medical abortion.
You've heard that. And -- and -- Okay.
And on the other one, as far as, I mean, Doe 2, Doe 2 says I -- I -- I tried to get a covering doctor.
He said no.
The other covering doctors, there's no point because I'm in Baton Rouge -- is that where he was, I think, Doe 2 -- and he said, look, it's a tougher climate here.
Really tough for people who perform abortions.
Quite different from New Orleans. And I was told by one that don't do it because you try to get the covering doctor and that doctor would be subject to picketing, dah-dah-dah.
Okay.
We have all seen that. So we have gone through it.
We'll go through it more.
What do you want to say? So I -- I think Doe 2's in -- in Shreveport.
But far more importantly, what I would say is this: In a pre-enforcement setting, that sort of debate back and forth isn't enough to carry the burden. What ought to have to happen is these physicians ought to have to put their applications where their mouths are and then we'll find out, once they have applied to the full range of hospitals, whether they really can't, whether Doe 2 really can't at Christus, whether Doe 5 really can't find a covering doctor in Baton Rouge, whether Doe 6 really can't at Touro. Can that be done? Is it not -- But on this record I'm very skeptical that they can't. Is it not -- is it not a reality, is it not really the fact, that almost all hospitals in the State of Louisiana do have an admission, you have to have an admission record in order to admit patients? There is something in the record to that effect that you -- you don't get -- if you don't send patients to the hospital, you don't get admission privileges. You may answer. Justice Ginsburg, I think that's difficult to square with the fact that Doe 5, who does not have an OB-GYN practice, got privileges at Touro.
I think Petitioners acknowledge that there are not explicit patient minimums.
They call them implicit. But the kinds of requirements that they are pointing to are the sorts of things that look like they would have precluded Doe 5 and didn't.
These ought to play themselves out in a post-enforcement context, not as here. Thank you, General. Thank you. Five minutes, Ms. Rikelman. Your Honor, the lack of benefits of these laws is not state-dependent. The medical consensus is clear that in no state do they serve health and safety benefits. And, in fact, even the federal government a few months ago removed an admitting privileges requirement from its regulations of surgery centers nationwide, finding that the requirement is medically unnecessary and imposes burdens. And as Justice Kagan asked, this Court rejected an alleged credentialing benefit in Whole Woman's Health.
And after holding a trial, the district court rejected that this law would serve a credentialing benefit in Louisiana. With respect to burdens, the district court found that this law would be extremely burdensome, more so than the Texas law in Whole Woman's Health.
And its finding that these physicians would not be able to get privileges is supported by at least four aspects of the record. The fact that they tried to get privileges at 15 hospitals over one-and-a-half years under the court's supervision; the fact that the state's expert conceded that outpatient physicians who don't have a hospital-based practice are unlikely to get privileges; the fact that abortion access was thrown into chaos when this law actually took effect; and the hospital bylaws themselves, which included a variety of criteria that these physicians could never meet, including residency requirements. And, finally, I'd like to point out that this is not, in fact, a pre-enforcement challenge.
The state has recognized that, including in its state papers before this Court. The district court allowed the law to take effect but enjoined its penalties and supervised the physicians' efforts to get privileges over a year and a half.
Again, the state has previously acknowledged that this is not a pre-enforcement challenge. If there are no further questions. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this term in Case Number 18-6135, Kahler versus Kansas. Ms. Schrup. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For centuries, criminal culpability has hinged on the capacity for moral judgment, to discern and to choose between right and wrong.
The insane lack that capacity. This understanding of insanity has persisted since the 1500s and remains the rule in 48 jurisdictions today.
But Kansas scrubs moral capacity from its criminal law and runs afoul of the Fourteenth and the Eighth Amendments. Kansas rewrites history in two ways, first by elevating the wild beast test, one that was never used in this country and only rarely in England, and secondly by conflating common law intent, which required a vicious will and was bound up in moral capacity, with the -- what it applies today, a morality-free modern mens rea. As such, Kansas uproots the deeply rooted by eliminating any mechanism to assess whether a defendant's capacity for moral judgment was intact or was irretrievably compromised by mental illness. Now, I'd like to turn briefly to due process first and explain why the moral capacity notion is and always has been fundamental in our system. The model penal code is an excellent exam -- example.
As criminal law evolved, the drafters moved to more precise mental states. When they did that, though, they retained the compelling mechanism to show insanity.
We could do that, the drafters said, because we kept this, this narrow remnant of common law criminality. In Clark, too, this Court recognized both the presumption of sanity and that evidence of insanity trumps mens rea.
This demonstrates the continued need for a mechanism to rebut the presumption of sanity, even when -- even though a defendant harbors the requisite mental state. And it was not only the mechanism that was important in Clark; the substance was too.
This Court said Arizona could do that, it could eliminate the first part of the M'Naghten test, because it kept this, the right and wrong principle that subsumes it. So I'd like to now turn back to history because it can be -- Well, before you do that, you're relying on due process.
And suppose a state decides it wants to rethink the insanity defense.
It looks to other nations for models.
And one is what's known as a -- as a judgment of guilty but insane; that is, two determinants are made.
Did the defendant do the act with which he is charged? That's the first question.
And the second question is, what is the proper incapacitation? So guilty but insane would lead to incapacitation in a mental institution.
Guilty and not insane would lead to incarceration in prison. Would such a scheme, if adopted by a state of the United States, violate due process? Yes, it would, Justice Ginsburg.
And I think it would because the conviction itself carries collateral consequences that -- and we have never, as a country, treated the insane as culpable.
And that conviction would -- would impose collateral consequences on the insane person who really should be that something more is.
And I -- You can -- -- think for this here -- You can, I mean, that was the point of my question, I think.
The law has many, many ways of, in different circumstances, trying to separate out individuals for whom the criminal justice system is just not going to work in terms of preventing, et cetera, the crimes. One, the wind blew my arm.
Okay? Two, duress, because in a duress case you're looking to see could the -- could the defendant have done otherwise. With insanity you're close to that. Often it's a question of could the defendant have done otherwise. And even where not, it is is this individual so different from an ordinary individual that it just doesn't make sense to apply the law? Now, if some something like that is going on, then my question, if, in fact, he's the dog, out.
Why isn't it? The dog told me to do it. Now, that's the fourth time I have asked that.
But I would like to know what you think about it. So these are obviously difficult questions, Justice Breyer.
They're ones that societies have wrestled with for centuries in trying to balance the medical and moral and legal judgments that go into crafting an insanity rule. This Court has long recognized that states have principal responsibility to do that. And I think that there are various ways states could decide that they want to distinguish between those two defendants. For one thing that cognitive incapacity test which focuses on whether the individual thinks that the person he shot was a dog, might be an easier inquiry for juries to undertake.
It might be a more readily-observable sign of mental illness and less likely to lead to confusion about what was actually in the defendant's mind and whether he was considering right versus wrong. A jurisdiction might also think that looking at considerations of individual culpability, they don't want an on/off switch for criminal responsibility but, rather, want to shift those considerations to the sentencing stage where a judge can take evidence and make a more nuanced determination of individual culpability. Ultimately -- How does that stay -- -- I think that these -- -- consistent with Apprendi, assuming we find that since the beginning of modern thought that there is an irreducible minimum of due process that requires the insane to be not convicted by a judge or put in a mental institution by a judge but by a jury? May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice? Yes. There would still be a question, Justice Sotomayor, of how you define who is the insane.
That's a legal concept. It's one that's yielded no single formulation. And I think for this Court to try to articulate a theory of moral culpability could throw into question state laws across the nation that are trying to make these difficult judgments. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Schrup, you have five minutes remaining. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I'd like to make three quick points: First, the problem with the mens rea approach, to get to Justice Breyer and Sotomayor's point, is that it scrapes out the why, the underlying motivation fueled by mental illness that explains a defendant's act.
And that has been a part of our history for centuries. And that gets to the dog or the dog example.
It's completely arbitrary.
I don't know why if you think -- why one defendant who thinks that a dog, he's shooting a dog, versus another one who thinks a dog is ordering him to shoot someone else, makes any difference whatsoever.
The first person is acquitted and let out on the streets and the second is put in jail and maybe put to death. The second piece of this -- and so there's no safety net, basically.
What Kansas does, actually, is even more extreme because it limits the kind of mental illness evidence that could come in, and it is essentially advocating -- it -- it never explains why or whether there is any light between the wild beast test and the M'Naghten I test, but either way it is fundamentally different than what we have had historically and what 48 jurisdictions retain. Second, I'd like to turn to my friend on the other side's notion that -- that there is some limits.
He actually doesn't suggest anything.
And if you look at page 39 and 40 of their brief, basically everything is up for grabs. There can be no mens rea.
They can make everything strict liability.
Duress, self-defense, all of these defenses are on the line because, according to them, all that's required in Kansas is a voluntary act and intentionality. And, finally, turning back to history, it's just not right to say that the right and wrong principle is a 19th Century invention. There is a wall of cases and authorities starting in the 1500s and continuing, uninterrupted, all the way through until 1843 when M'Naghten was formed. There's literally scores of cases, here and in England, applying the right and wrong principle. To contrast that with the test that they suggest, which is essentially the wild beast test, that was invoked maybe two or three times.
It was a blip. So history favors us.
And although due process is a rigorous burden for a petitioner to meet, we satisfy it here because they have taken something out of our fundamental criminal culpability, what we believe as a country, they have scraped it out and they are punishing the insane as a result. If this Court has no further questions, we would ask you to please -- Well, I would -- -- reverse the case. -- ask you a question if you -- if you've finished your -- your -- the comments that you want to make. In your reply brief you say that the state's premise is that insanity was traditionally tied to a lack of mens rea.
And you say -- you agree with that, right? It was tied to common law intent, if we use the term mens rea, but it was tied to common law intent, which is a very different term than what they used, Justice Alito. Well, you -- I -- I'll quote you: ""The state's premise is that insanity was traditionally tied to a lack of mens rea, true, but mens rea historically required precisely the moral blame worthiness that Kansas law now excludes."" So that's your historical position. That's half of our -- And how do you reconcile that with the fact that mens rea does not vary from crime to crime? So if that was the understanding of mens rea, that would apply in every case and there would have to be moral blame worthiness in every case, not just those where the -- the -- the lack of blame worthiness is attributable to mental -- to a mental disorder, however that is defined? If I'm understanding your question, Justice Alito, yes, mens rea, but mens rea historically or common law intent always contained this moral component, this -- Then it would -- -- intent to harm. -- apply across the board. It would, with the exception of -- It would apply -- -- perhaps strict liability. -- to the person who said I assassinated this political leader because he is an evil person -- Oh. -- and he is going to do evil things. No, Justice Alito, because the only people that were -- that this has traditionally been applied to are the insane and maybe infants and that's what -- And that's what you are arguing for, a separate insanity defense, and that was M'Naghten.
But that's inconsistent with the historical record as you, yourself, understand it, which is that it was tied to mens rea, which is categorical, applies in every single case.
What -- what is wrong with that? Our position is that to the extent it was tied to mens rea, inherent in the notion of mens rea was the ability to choose between right and wrong. So that is very different.
That is very different than what Kansas has today, which has no inquiry into that. I mean, these 18th Century cases that talk about moral capability or lack thereof in mens rea in the same breadth are hard to understand, but you have to take into account -- may I finish my sentence -- Certainly. -- Mr. Chief Justice? (Laughter.) That you have to take into account that people -- that the 18th Century and early 19th Century understanding of how the human mind works was very different from what we have today.
There wasn't even any -- any such thing as psychiatry in 1791 and it was in its infancy in 1868.
Is that wrong? Mr. Chief Justice? You may. I want to answer this succinctly.
It's not about what mental illness was or wasn't.
It's about how we treated insane people, this narrow group of them.
I think everybody knows who they are when they are forced to decide it.
And it's about not punishing people who don't know right from wrong. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-834, Kansas versus Garcia. General Schmidt. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a typical and recent year, more than 15 million Americans became victims of identity theft.
One-third of those had their personal information misused in an employment or tax-related fraud setting. Many of those victims were left to untangle reputations, eligibilities, and other finances.
That is why Kansas, like every other state, makes identity theft a crime.
Our laws apply in all settings to all people, citizen and alien alike. Respondents were convicted because they stole other people's personal information with intent to defraud.
But, in Respondents' view, these state criminal laws that govern everybody else do not apply to them.
They argue that Congress has, in effect, granted them special immunity because their intent was to obtain employment that Congress has forbidden. This Court never has so held and should not now.
The conflict fatal to the Arizona employment statute is not present here, because Kansas prohibits the theft of personal information by anybody, not work by unauthorized aliens.
And this Court has identified no preempted field relevant here. Section 1324a(b)(5) means what it says and no more.
The I-9 verification system is available only for specified federal uses. (b)(5)'s use limitation, which is quite different from typical preemption provisions, is one of several safeguards Congress adopted in 1986 to limit both governments' and employers' use of the then novel I-9 system. But traditional state criminal law still reaches misconduct elsewhere in the employment context if proven without use of the I-9 system.
For example, states certainly still may prosecute a felon who uses a stolen identity to defeat a background check as a condition of employment at a child care center, even if he also used the same stolen identity on his Form I-9.
So too with the tax withholding forms used here. But isn't it telling, General Schmidt, that in all three cases that we have, the prosecutor initially charged false Social Security number on the I-9, and it was only when the prosecutor appreciated that that couldn't be done that the I-9 charge was deleted? I think these cases are here, Justice Ginsburg, because they do, of course, present the issue of the intersection between IRCA and generally applicable state law. These cases all straddled, in their time lines, this Court's decision in Arizona.
And I think that explains why the state originally attempted to use the I-9, then understood this Court's holding in Arizona, and withdrew from use of the I-9. I would point out, Your Honor, that all three cases arose, were discovered, the fraud was discovered, in a context outside the employment setting.
This is not what was happening in subsequent cases in Arizona. Mr. Garcia's fraud was discovered first in a records check at a traffic stop; Mr. Morales, from a separate investigation related to workers' compensation; and Mr. Ochoa-Lara, from a separate investigation -- Do you -- -- of different criminal conduct in the department. -- do you agree that the result what the structure Congress created in IRCA.
I don't think there's any other way to understand what 1324a(b)(5) does.
Again, I believe Kansas is in agreement that they can't prosecute fraud if the fraud is on the I-9 itself. And in every case there is going to be a K-4 and a W-4, in every single case.
And so, if -- if Kansas is correct about a federal preemption in this context, 1324a(b)(5) did effectively nothing -- So the state can't -- -- when Congress enacted it. -- according to you, can't have a law that says you can't have a job in this state unless you submit a K-4? Kansas -- sorry, a state -- Kansas can't say, have a law, that says you can't have a job in this state without a K-4? I think Kansas probably -- I don't think there's a federal preemption problem with that.
And, again, as we -- So why isn't that this case? They're saying they couldn't get this job unless they submitted the K-4? That -- that's not this case because that is not the State of Kansas law.
Under Kansas law, it's actually to the opposite.
As we noted in Footnote 8 of our brief, Kansas law does not require the submission of a K-4 at the time of hiring. As a matter of fact, it generally does occur.
But Kansas state law specifically provides for individuals to be hired without submitting a K-4.
So there's simply not the theory of -- of prosecution that was available to Kansas in the facts of this case and not what it was that they, in -- in fact, advanced. So, ultimately, again, we think that this is a narrow case, that use of false information to show federal work authorization is the element that is preempted. It's a clear rule.
It's a rule that the trial courts across the states can regularly implement.
We think it's the only rule that actually gives effect to what Congress did in 1324a(b)(5).
Absent that rule, states would be eligible to prosecute the exact same offense that I think everybody agrees is expressly preempted under -- under the -- the -- the text of IRCA so long as it's given a different name. And that's simply not how preemption works.
As this Court has said repeatedly, preemption looks to what the state of the facts regulating -- Excuse me. -- not the label that the state uses for the prosecution. How is it expressly preempted under (b)(5)? That argument mystifies me, because (b)(5) says nothing about work authorization.
It says nothing about aliens. It says nothing about the use of the information by a state government or by the federal government.
It applies to any use. How you can read the argument that you're making into (b)(5) is something that escapes me.
Can you explain that? So a -- a few things, Your Honor.
First, I think (b)(5) certainly identifies the policy that Congress enacted which informs our arguments under field preemption.
And I think that may in part be the best way to look at this. But, second, with respect to -- to (b)(5) itself, I don't think there is much dispute that it is a preemption provision, because I think the -- the federal government has agreed that it means you can't prosecute fraud on the I-9 form itself. The real question is, what is the breadth of that express preemption provision? And what Kansas has suggested is that it's either all or nothing, that either it -- the -- the language and any information contained in effectively does nothing because it reduces just to what the form is or -- or a partial aspect of the form, or, if you give any meaning to that language, then there's no limitation and everything is fair game. That is not how the Court should interpret this and that's not how the Court interprets preemption statutes more broadly. Take, for example, the Maracich v. Spears case where the Court was assessing the language in connection with this. No, but you want us to say -- you say it's expressly preempted, even though all of the elements, practically all of the elements of the rule that you're advocating are not mentioned at all in (b)(5).
But you want us to read all of those in and then say this is an express -- this expressly preempts. Now you may have a good argument under some other category of preemption, but how it can be expressed and how it can be express preemption is really -- is really something. Well, this is information that is contained in and they're using it for the same purposes that underlie (b)(5), which is showing -- But did I -- -- federal employment authorization. -- understand you to say that you thought your better theory was field preemption, not express preemption? I -- I think they're both good theories, Your Honor, but, yes, I think the (b)(5) points up to field preemption and I think field preemption is a very strong theory for us because this -- we have direct congressional direction that establishes the -- the balance between the states and the federal government. And in (b)(5), whether one thinks that that is express preemption or not, I think it -- it undeniably identifies the policy judgment of Congress that the federal government alone should have the authority to prosecute these immigration offenses. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, General Schmidt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to try to make three points. With respect to Justice Alito's line of questioning on the (b)(5) language, (b)(5) is certainly, if read as a preemption provision, most unusual, at -- not least of which is because it is not aimed exclusively at states. Preemption is a supremacy clause concept that regulates the relationship between the federal government and states. But (b)(5) speaks not only to that but also to the relationship between the law Congress passed and what the federal government may do, and, most importantly, as I was discussing earlier with Justice Kagan, what private employers may do with this information that they were compelled to collect and maintain in a novel manner back in 1986. And we think that explains your earlier question, Justice Alito, with respect to what does ""information contained in"" mean.
We think it is an effort by Congress to make absolutely clear, not just to states and not just to the federal government, but to millions of private employers who now must by command of federal law maintain this private information, that they may not use the form or information harvested from the form or information attached and submitted for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the form.
We don't think express preemption gets them there. Second, with respect to the benefit question, which I think goes perhaps to -- I'm not sure if it goes to conflict or -- or field, I'm a little uncertain about that -- but on the benefit issue, I -- I -- I -- the -- the -- what we agree is off limits is the I-9 system. We aren't arguing that Kansas prosecuted these individuals because they were trying to commit fraud on the I-9 system.
We're arguing that they defrauded folks whose identities were stolen and that we used as evidence the W-4 and K-4 tax forms.
We didn't use the I-9 system. With respect to the notion that somehow preemption turns not on the intent of Congress but on the subjective intent of the offender, that turns preemption analysis on its head. And a hypothetical I think that illustrates that, imagine that let's say Mr. Garcia on the facts here were stopped for speeding not because he was headed to a job he already had but because he was headed with completed employment forms, applications in the back of his car, to apply for the job. He still would be guilty of the same state law crimes of identity theft.
His intent was to obtain the benefit of employment.
But he never arrived at the employer to apply for the job in the first place.
That can't be the test that makes the difference here. And, finally, with respect to the -- the notion of what the state is asking for here, we're -- we're a little unclear on exactly what field our friends on the other side think is preempted. As I suggested earlier, if there is one, it has to be extremely narrow, the I-9 system itself, but we're not sure a field exists there because of the decision in Whiting that states may compel the use of the E-Verify system, which certainly is part of work authorization. So this Court has never identified a field and should not with respect to this case. The conflict, we don't see.
The conflict that was present in Arizona, as we discussed earlier, is not present here.
This is a fundamentally different case. Kansas is not trying to act as an immigration enforcer but to enforce our generally applicable identity theft laws. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-556, Kansas versus Glover. General Crouse. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Reasonable suspicion is a minimal standard.
It permits a brief investigation upon an officer's objective and particularized suspicion.
Common-sense judgments and inferences about ordinary expenses -- experiences are the touchstone of reasonable suspicion. Here, Deputy Mehrer found a vehicle on the road, learned that the registered driver was incapable of lawfully operating that vehicle, had the belief that under common sense the registered owner was likely the driver, pulled the vehicle over, initiated the stop, cited the individual for being a habitual violator. That common-sense belief that Deputy Mehrer had is one that has been recognized by the judges in 12 state supreme courts, four circuit courts of appeals across the country, and that is that finding the registered owner of the vehicle as a driver is a common-sense inference, absent information to the contrary. Some may argue that the existence of a suspended license would undermine that suspicion, but the, of the 16 courts that I just mentioned, 11 of them have dealt with this precise situation, and the judges of those courts have indicated that reasonable suspicion continues to exist even in that circumstance. Indeed, the factual predicate for the habitual violator law across the country is that the registered owner may be continuing to drive. And the only thing we're asking here is whether or not there's reasonable suspicion to investigate further. Here, Deputy Mehrer relied upon the common-sense understanding that a registered owner, given the pervasiveness of automobile use in the United States, was likely to be driving again, warranted additional investigation.
To borrow a phrase from Terry, it would have been poor police work for Deputy Mehrer not to initiate the stop in this case and investigate further to confirm or dispel his suspicion. At this point, I would invite any questions from the Court. Mr. Crouse, many of those cases that you referenced involved at least an officer who testified, speaking about, in his experience, drivers tend to be owners. We don't have anything like that here. We have -- We don't. -- we have an officer who said he assumed that.
And that's a pretty unusual -- you're asking us to make an inference about facts when there are no facts in the record at all, zero. Well -- What do we do about that? So, to -- to the contrary, we believe that the stipulations are the facts. Well, the stipulation, as I understand it, though, is the officer said he assumed. Yeah. Yeah. So -- We don't -- we don't have any ""in my experience,"" nothing -- no -- nothing -- So -- so there are two aspects to that. -- other than an assumption. First of them is with regard to the stipulations, the parties have stipulated as to what the relevant facts were. If they believed there was information absent from those facts, they -- they could have and would have done Kansas Supreme Court's words literally.
It said, when a court draws inferences in favor of the state based on a lack of evidence in the record, it impermissibly relieves the state of its burden. Right. And very carefully it says, here, the problem is not that the state necessarily needs significantly more evidence, it needs some more evidence. Right.
I think that's -- that has to be true.
And -- and the Kansas Supreme Court said, I'm not even going to try to list all the different ways you could do it because there are so many, but you have to just do something.
And that's sort of all that what we're asking for. That is what this Court has said time and time again in its Fourth Amendment cases, that you have to look at the totality of circumstances.
You can't just rely on a single sort of -- single fact that has a probability-based correlation, maybe, to a crime. You have to come in and explain the basis for your suspicion.
My friend, Mr. Crouse, talked about Terry, but Terry did not adopt a bright-line rule that anytime someone walks past a store window three times, you automatically have reasonable suspicion, right? They relied on the officer's experience, his observations of other things that were going on.
That's all we're saying in this case you should do, just rely on other -- other things that were observed, other things the officer knew.
Maybe in his experience, the database is extremely unreliable, but that would be something that's relevant to know. Maybe in his experience it's extremely reliable also would be relevant to know.
You just need something more. Do you think in Terry they needed statistics about the percentage of people who walked by a window three times who have some criminal intent? No.
But, in Terry, there wasn't a sort of probability-based suspicion.
But also, I want -- I want to be clear.
We don't think the state needs statistics.
Kansas relied on statistics in its opening brief to this Court.
We think they were bad statistics, and its amici statistics were bad statistics.
They are not relevant to the central question in this case. And so our point in our brief in discussing the statistics is at least you have to rely on good statistics, right? So what's -- you said something, it certainly caught my attention.
I thought the officer was probably saying the right thing, in my experience, people who own cars are likely to be the drivers. It -- End of the matter, until you point out, not them, you point out that here the driver had lost his license.
Now it becomes more difficult.
But you keep saying not a bright-line rule.
I don't think there's a bright-line rule.
I don't see that. You want to add other things.
What other things? And if there were other things that were relevant to this, why not call the officer -- Because it -- -- and ask him about them? Because it's -- And if you want to say no, that's unreasonable given my fact, given my fact, you probably didn't say that because, actually, the statistics show 75 percent, you know, 60 percent, but not here, dah-dah-dah. Okay, we're into that. So -- But what is it -- what is it that you think is that extra thing in the facts here that should have been in? I mean, I've listed like ten things he could have done and he didn't do any of them, but -- I didn't say that.
I said, what is it? I'm not talking about what he might have done. Yeah. I'm saying, what fact is there other than the two he pointed to and the one you added that you think was relevant? So the -- the drive -- the behavior of the driver could have been relevant.
It could have been relevant whether Mr. -- No, I'm not asking could have been. Well, I don't -- I don't know because they didn't come forward. Oh, all right.
So -- It's the state's burden to -- -- your point is -- -- put forward the evidence. -- you should decide all the facts, but I can't point you to a fact that wasn't -- that was relevant and wasn't decided.
I mean -- Well, how about -- -- you say they shouldn't just do -- How about his experience and training? Yeah.
I mean, he could have testified about his experience and training.
Maybe in his experience, you know, nine times out of ten or 99 times out of 100 when you pull someone over in this circumstance, it's not the unlicensed owner who's driving the car.
We just don't know, right? They need to come in -- under the rule Kansas wants, anytime someone borrows a car that's registered to an unlicensed owner, there's literally nothing she could do to avoid being seized, right? If you adopt this bright-line rule, there's nothing she could do to avoid being seized.
That has to be evidence, strong evidence, that the rule is overly broad. And what you are proposing is either a trivial decision or a revolutionary decision.
It's a trivial decision if all that's lacking here is a statement, I've been trained that, blah, blah, blah. It's a revolutionary decision if in every case involving reasonable suspicion there has to be a statistical showing or an examination of all the things that you think are necessary here. Is that not right? May I answer? Sure. Justice Alito, what we're asking for is that the ordinary Fourth Amendment contextual analysis be required in every case.
It doesn't require statistics in every case.
It doesn't require any magic words. It just requires something to support the reasonableness of an assumption. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, General Crouse. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'd like to first start with regard to the officer's training and experience and the lack of testimony. The reason that isn't in this case is because Mr. Glover stipulated to the facts below and failed to raise any question as to the officer's training and experience until the red brief in this Court.
See page 4 of our reply brief. But wait a minute. Whose burden is it? Isn't it yours? You have to prove the facts. We have proved the stipulated facts. Well, you proved -- They didn't challenge those facts. -- that fact, but they don't have to if you don't prove enough. So they didn't -- They could -- they could -- you could come in and say he wore a red hat, that's why I stopped him, and they would come back and say, that's not enough to make out reasonable suspicion. So, if what they're saying is making an assumption without telling us what the basis of that assumption is, is not enough. So the point is they stipulated to the facts that were relevant to the determination, and the Kansas Supreme Court made a determination as to those facts. My point is that didn't arise until the red brief in this Court.
And so we don't think it's fair to criticize once they've agreed.
If they wanted to indicate as to what the statistics were, they had an opportunity to call that officer and cross-examine him. Second, with regard to waiting for a violation, as Justice Kavanaugh talked about, we think that's a perfectly reasonable situation if we're going to eliminate reasonable suspicion. Rather, if there's a traffic violation, that's probable cause for a stop and that's not a basis.
This Court's decision has indicated that you don't have to wait for probable cause in order to initiate a stop.
And so I think your question was right on. Third, statistics.
We agree with the red brief that indicates that statistics are rarely present and frequently are going to be distinguished by the parties.
And so we don't believe that statistics are relevant. Fourth, we also believe that -- May I go back to the stipulation? You said it's -- Kansas drew the stipulation, right? The parties drew the stipulation, agreed to them, and presented them to the court. So it was a joint stipulation? The parties stipulated, yes, Your Honor. The fourth point I would like to make is that the Fourth Amendment does not and should not apply differently based upon the age and experience of the officer or the time of day of the Fourth Amendment. The rule that Respondents propose would require the officers to let this vehicle go at night because it's impossible to identify. This Court's cases, except for, I believe, a no knock warrant, does not do that.
Certainly, the reasonable suspicion cases do not do that. And, fifth, the states have a strong interest in regulating the roadways of the traffic situation here, and they have a strong law enforcement interest. For example, if there's a report of a -- a child that had been -- You can finish your thought. Thank you.
A child that had been abducted, and we were looking for the mother, the officers would be reasonable to rely upon the license plate. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1059, Kelly versus United States. Mr. Roth. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Once again, the government is trying to use the open-ended federal fraud statutes to enforce honest government at the state and local levels.
Its theory this time is that the defendants committed property fraud by reallocating two traffic lanes from one public road to another without disclosing their real political reason for doing so. This theory turns the integrity of every official action at every level of government into a potential federal fraud investigation.
It end-runs McNally and Skilling by subsuming honest services fraud within property fraud and by criminalizing ulterior motives even without bribes or kickbacks.
It would effect a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction into a particularly fraught area. This is not the law.
This Court in Cleveland held that regulatory authority is not property.
So an official who induces a sovereign decision through deceit has not obtained property by fraud.
Only when the official lies to divert state resources to private use has he stepped outside the regulatory realm and committed property fraud. This rule distinguishes property fraud from honest services fraud and from routine political conduct. Here, because the defendants simply reallocated the traffic lanes from one public use to another, the Port Authority at most was deprived of regulatory control, not property. And that's true regardless of whether, as the government now alleges, the defendants lacked the authority in some sense to order the realignment. Mr. Levy will explain why the government is wrong to say that, but it's ultimately legally irrelevant because the fraud statutes do not prohibit lying to take unauthorized state action.
They prohibit lying to obtain property.
And that simply is not what occurred in this case. You've said that if the resources were diverted to private use, then the prosecution would be okay.
But why isn't it a private use to benefit defendants politically? Your Honor, I'm trying to distinguish the use of the property from the motive for the decision.
So here the decision was to realign the lanes from one set of public drivers to another set of public drivers.
Both are public uses of the lanes. Now, it's true the motive, the alleged motive, for that regulatory decision was improper.
It was political, right? That's the allegation in the case.
But that doesn't mean that -- that it's -- that the use of the lanes was private.
It's not -- Your Honor, the typical case in which the government has prosecuted property fraud against a public official is where the official lies to take property from the government for his own use. So a situation where you lie on your expense report, you say you incurred this expense for business reasons and you did not. In that situation, you're lying and you're taking the property out -- away from the government for yourself.
That is obtaining property. Here, what the defendants influenced through their deceit was the decision about the alignment of the lanes.
And if there's anything that is -- can -- -- Justice Kagan. Can I switch, because the statute clearly says that a scheme of deception has to -- the object of it has to be to obtain property.
So can we talk about that for a minute? Because if I look at this, and I'm an ordinary juror, I'm thinking, you know, the object of this deception was not to obtain property.
The object was to create a traffic jam.
The object was to benefit people politically.
You can frame the object in lots of ways. But notwithstanding that some employee time was given over to this scheme, that was not the object of the scheme, was it, to appropriate that employee time? Well, Your Honor, I think it was because this was -- this gets back to what I was saying to Justice Breyer earlier. This is a particular type of fraud, where -- it's commandeering fraud, where what they're trying to do is to take property that's in the victim's hands, here the Port Authority, and convert it to their own uses. It may be that if I take a knife off a table and stab -- that doesn't belong to me, and stab someone, my end goal is to stab someone but I've still stolen the knife. But wasn't the commandeering here completely incidental, indeed unnecessary to the scheme being carried out? In other words, you know, there was a little bit of -- of -- of time for an extra toll person, actually to mitigate the -- the problems of the traffic jam or there were some people running around counting cars to conceal the purpose for what they were -- of what they were doing, but that was not the object of the scheme. No, Your Honor, the object of the scheme was for them to take control of real property, physical lanes, accessing the George Washington Bridge, and have those lanes be allocated the way they wanted. Okay.
So that's a different theory.
That's not the employee time and labor.
That's something about like appropriating the George Washington Bridge; is that right? That is one -- But it's not appropriating the George Washington Bridge, it's reallocating lanes on the George Washington Bridge and I would have thought that Cleveland makes clear that that's not an appropriation of property either. I -- I -- Your Honor, I think it's both because they needed the employee resources in order to accomplish what they were trying to do with the bridge. And if I could address Cleveland for a second, this case and Cleveland do both involve governmental decision-making but that's where the similarities end. In Cleveland, the object of the scheme was to obtain a license under a regulatory scheme that had no private analog whatsoever. The Court rejected every private analog the government offered for it.
And the license wasn't property in the government's hands. Here you're talking about real property, physical lanes and who can access those lanes, and access rights to physical property are quintessential forms of private property, probably one of the oldest forms of property we have. And then you have the employee resources necessary to reallocate the lanes, which I think even they acknowledge are property under the fraud statute.
They acknowledge that if you send painters to paint the mayor's house, that that's going to be property fraud because you're taking the employee services. But that's because the object of the scheme is to use the employee labor to get your house painted, but I -- I don't think that you can say the same thing here. Your Honor, the -- You were not -- -- reason -- -- using the employee labor to create the traffic jam. They are using the employee labor as if it were theirs, not as if it were something that the Port Authority gets to use.
So, again, in the private context, if I were to impersonate the boss and start ordering around the company jet, I think I have obtained the company jet and probably -- Well, but you picked -- -- the pilot's time as well. You -- you picked -- you picked an example that is easy for you.
I mean, the example that's hard for you, I think, is you tell the employee to pick up the phone and call somebody and say this.
That's a bad thing. And then immediately you say: Okay, it's property fraud because I've used the -- the employee has used the telephone, or I've used the four minutes of that employee's time necessary to convey the message. So -- Your theory would say that that's taking of property so it's covered by the fraud statutes. We wouldn't, Your Honor, and I'm -- I'm actually glad to have a -- a chance to -- to make this perfectly clear.
And this gets back to Justice Kagan's question as well. Incidental uses of property that are not the object of the scheme are not going to be sufficient for property fraud.
And I think the easiest place to look for that is this Court's decision in Loughrin, which involved bank fraud. And the Court said there that if you tell a lie and the object of your lie is to obtain money, it's not bank fraud simply because, unrelated to your lie, you didn't really care how the money came to you.
The money comes to you in the form of a check, which is bank property, as opposed to in the form of cash, which isn't. If someone is -- if someone tells a lie and the object is to obtain a license from the State of Louisiana to operate a video poker machine, which is not property, they're not committing property fraud just because some employee needs to spend some time processing the license.
That's not the object. Well, here the object -- the object of the scheme was not to commandeer lanes on the bridge.
The object was to cause a traffic jam in Fort Lee.
And if they could have done it some other way, they would have done it some other way. The use of the traffic -- you know, altering the traffic lane configuration was just the incidental means of achieving the objective. I don't think that's right, Your Honor.
The lie they told to the Port Authority to get the Port Authority resources was to -- a lie they told in order to get those resources.
The causing of the traffic jam was what they wanted to accomplish with those resources. If I tell a lie to get access to the company jet, it may be that my goal is to take it on a vacation trip to Macao, but that's not the object of the scheme as far as the fraud is concerned and the victim of the fraud. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Roth. Thank you.
Your Honor, the -- the federal property fraud statute prohibits schemes to obtain property.
And the government's theory of property here, as I think we just heard, is that the officials, by making this decision about lane alignment, commandeered the control over the George Washington Bridge. That is exactly the type of regulatory control that Cleveland said is not property.
Cleveland referred to the intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and control.
And the sovereign's intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and control are not property for purposes of this statute. And, therefore, if what the officials did was used a seat to influence the exercise of those rights, they have not obtained property from the Port Authority.
If that is not correct, then everything an official does is -- falls within the scope of this statute, and the only question that is open is was there some deceit involved? And if -- if that is right, I think the chilling effect on honest public servants is going to be severe. Mr. Roth, you responded to one-half of their theory.
One-half of their theory is the allocation of lanes. Yes. And the other half is the employee time. Yes. So what's your response to that? My response to that, it's actually what he said at the end, which is that the incidental costs of a decision are not the -- are not its object.
And it's what Your Honor asked in earlier question.
The implementation of the regulatory decision is going to use some public resources.
That cannot possibly change the result, or else Cleveland is a complete dead letter. Why do you call it incidental? I mean, it was essential to the scheme. Because it's incidental, Your Honor, in that it -- it was the implementation cost.
It flowed as -- as a result of the regulatory decision.
The regulatory decision was to realign the lanes. That required some employee time in terms of taking tolls and studying the traffic effect, but that was not the object.
That was how it got done. What if it cost a million dollars? Would it be incidental? No -- yes, Your Honor.
It would be a incidental.
It's not a de minimis test.
It's a question of what is the object. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We will hear argument first this morning in Case Number 19-431, Little Sisters of the Poor versus Pennsylvania, and the consolidated case. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2011, the government required employers to provide insurance coverage for all FDA-approved contraception, including many religious employers who objected to the coverage, sparking years of litigation.
In 2017, in the best traditions of this country's commitment to religious liberty, the government sought to resolve the issue by promulgating new rules exempting those employers who objected to the mandate. Those exemptions are lawful for two reasons.
First, they're authorized by Section 13(a)(4) of the ACA, which requires employers to provide the types of coverage that the Health Resources and Services Administration provides for and supports.
So it authorizes the agencies to require most employers to provide contraceptive coverage while exempting a small number of employers who have sincere conscientious objections. But it doesn't create an all-or-nothing choice: require coverage for everyone or no one.
Otherwise, the long-standing church exemption, the effective exemption for self-insured church plans, and, indeed, Respondents' understanding of the accommodation itself would also violate the statute since the employers' group health plans don't provide the mandated coverage. Second, RFRA at the very least authorizes the religious exemption.
It prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden on religious beliefs subject to a discretionary exception.
It may substantially burden religious beliefs if it can satisfy strict scrutiny. But RFRA doesn't require the government to do that.
Otherwise, the government would have to divine the stingiest accommodations that a court would uphold, virtually guaranteeing a loss in every case. Neither RFRA nor the ACA requires that result. I'd like to begin with the Section 13(a)(4) issue, which requires employers to provide whatever coverage HRSA provides for and supports. General, before you -- And, here, HRSA -- -- before you get to that, I'd like to ask you a question on your RFRA point.
I wonder why it doesn't sweep too broadly.
It is designed to address the concerns about self-certification and what the Little Sisters call the hijacking of their plan. But the RFRA exemption reaches far beyond that.
In other words, not everybody who seeks the protection from coverage has those same objections.
So I wonder if your reliance on RFRA is too broad. I don't think so, Your Honor, for a couple of different reasons. First, RFRA itself, in its operative language, prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden subject to a single exception.
And when you look at that exception, what it says is that the government may impose that burden if it thinks it can satisfy strict scrutiny. So, once there's a substantial burden, the government has the flexibility to lift it in different ways, including through a traditional exemption.
Otherwise, this Court's decision in Zubik doesn't make a whole lot of sense because, there, the Court ordered the government to consider further modifying the accommodation, even assuming the accommodation fully satisfied That doesn't make sense if RFRA prohibits anything that it doesn't affirmatively require. Thank of what additional preventive care and screenings are to be provided.
If you read ""as provided for"" as sort of applying to the entire section, sort of going back into subsection (a) and modifying those requirements, then you're sort of unmooring it from the way it's used in paragraph 4 and leaving ""such additional preventive care and screenings"" without any further explanation. And -- and, in addition, I think the other three categories provide some guidance and I think reasonably cabin the agency's authority. The other three paragraphs all refer to guidelines that already existed. So HRSA had the ability to look to those.
And those are all -- you know, there are no religious exemptions in those guidelines, there are no broad exemptions.
They're simply lists of services, lists of vaccinations that are required, other things. So where Congress lists several items, I think it's reasonable to conclude that Congress envisions that the agencies will operate or will exercise their discretion sort of in a similar manner in each instance.
And I think that's what was assumed here. But is -- is -- is -- is not part of that a function -- I think the argument is, A, we can't specify which preventative care and screenings will be provided or under what conditions and that any -- any provision of care is necessarily going to be conditioned and subject to all sorts of exceptions.
That's just the way the world works.
There's no rule without an exception. And -- and -- and toward that end, again, just drawing your attention back to the -- the accommodation for churches, many people have argued, and -- and, certainly, the prior administration did, that that was consistent with the statute, not -- not something imposed upon it from outside by the First Amendment. What do you say about that? Your Honor, so we disagree with the prior administration's conclusion that this section authorized the prior church exemption -- I understand that. -- and challenged and -- Let -- let -- let's suppose, though -- let's suppose, though, that that was correct.
And -- and -- and -- and I understand that's not your position. What would follow from that for this case? So, if -- if that were correct, then the agencies would have some discretion to create exemptions.
And then I think we would be in a position where we would evaluate these rules under arbitrary and capricious review.
And I think there are several problems with them, but we would not be in a world where the question of the agency's authority in the abstract was at issue. Okay.
And if I could turn quickly to one other point entirely, the substantial burden argument that Justice Alito raised.
And I -- I -- I understand your position.
I -- I -- I thought that there would be no substantial burden imposed by a requirement that they pay for contraceptive care.
Is -- is that correct? No, Your Honor, not at all.
I mean, that -- you know, if an employer objected to that requirement, there -- there would certainly be a -- a substantial burden. Okay.
All right, I misunderstood that colloquy then.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Your Honor. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Fischer. Good morning, Your Honor. I want to see your reaction to this way to think about the case, maybe picking up on Justice Breyer's question and -- and Justice Gorsuch's first question. As a number of my colleagues have pointed out, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Alito, Breyer and others, there are very strong interests on both sides here, which is what makes the case difficult, obviously.
There's religious liberty for the Little Sisters of the Poor and others.
There's the interest in ensuring women's access to healthcare and preventive services, which is also a critical interest.
So the question becomes, who decides? Who decides how to balance those interests? And the answer, of course, is Congress in the first interest -- instance. And -- and RFRA provides a backstop on that, but even beyond RFRA, in the ACA, Congress has delegated to the agency.
Okay, so we have a delegation from Congress to the agency, and -- which is common, and sometimes Congress delegates narrowly with narrow language, and sometimes it delegates broadly. And the rule of thumb I've always thought is courts should construe narrow language narrowly and broad language broadly. And this seems to be broad language, as Justice Thomas noted.
And when you have that kind of broad language, you're going to get different executive branches who are going to exercise their discretion within that broad language and balance the interests differently. And then the question is, what's the judicial role? And it seems to me the judicial role is not to put limits on the agency discretion that Congress has not put there. And then we're left, I think, as Justice Breyer said, with -- and -- and I want to get your reaction to this -- with the arbitrary and capricious test at the end of the day and just making sure that in exercising its discretion and balancing those interests, the agency didn't go outside the limits of reasonableness, which is a very deferential test.
It's not abdication, but it's deferential. Why isn't that the way to look at the case, and if we get down to the bottom line of is this reasonable, not maybe everyone's preferred choice but at least within the bounds of reasonable, why isn't this a reasonable way to balance it? So just get your reaction to all that. Thank you, Your Honor. So, on -- on that last point, the reason this is not a reasonable way of balancing is that the rules go well beyond when RFRA even arguably would require.
As we mentioned, for instance, companies that have no objection to accommodation are now wholly exempt. And however you interpret the Women's Health Amendment -- and -- and we -- we strenuously believe that it imposed a -- a mandatory duty on insurers to provide this coverage -- but, certainly, it would defeat the purpose of that amendment to say that women should not receive coverage if they work for an employer that objects to contraception generally but was willing to participate in the accommodation process or to note its objections so that they could still receive coverage. We also think there's -- that the exemption for publicly traded companies, in the absence of any evidence that any publicly traded companies requested one, goes well beyond.
We think the moral rule is so untethered from any reasonable standard that -- that it's certainly arbitrary and capricious. And we also think that -- that if we're in the RFRA world, that the way this exemption -- the way these exemptions are structured would really defeat any opportunity for scrutiny as to whether an employer claiming an objection has a sincere religious belief, whether it is substantially burdened, and would essentially remove the courts from the process entirely. And -- and I think one point to -- to remember is we are dealing with the interplay between two statutes, and as -- as the Court acknowledged in Epic Systems v. Lewis, ultimately, deciding how two statutes work together, where the boundaries are, is a question for courts.
That can't be left just to the agencies. And we submit the Women's Health Amendment impose a mandatory obligation.
It says, ""shall at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost-sharing requirements for."" And, nevertheless, what is clear from the -- the floor debate on that is that Congress envisioned that it would require coverage for preventive services, that family planning would be included. Now you also have extremely important interests in RFRA and in the nature of the religious objections that are being claimed. Ultimately, courts need to resolve these questions.
And the agencies have essentially taken these decisions out of the -- the realm of the judiciary and decided for themselves.
And that -- that simply isn't how RFRA works, and under Epic, it's not how these questions should be resolved. Thank you very much, Mr. Fischer. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. General Francisco, you have a minute for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Although RFRA both authorizes and requires these exemptions, at the very least, they're justified under Section 13(a)(4).
That, after all, was the very basis for the church exemption back in 2011.
It's also the basis for the effective exemption that applies to self-insured church plans, as illustrated with respect to the colloquy between my friend and Justice Sotomayor.
And if you accept Respondents' interpretation of the accommodation, it's also the basis for the accommodation itself. Under my friend's position, they seem to concede that all of these other provisions violate Section 13(a)(4).
After all, the church exemption is not limited to ministers, and the church exemption applies to churches that don't even object to contraception. But regardless of how you resolve the issue, the rules here bring a decade-long dispute to a durable end, and they should be upheld. Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1501, Liu versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Rapawy. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: SEC disgorgement orders compel a payment to the Treasury as a consequence for violation of a public law.
An order like that is a penalty, as this Court's unanimous decision in Kokesh makes clear. A penalty must be authorized by statute.
So must any action by an administrative agency.
There is no statutory authority for the SEC to seek disgorgement orders from a federal court and, therefore, it cannot. I have three main points to make this morning.
First, the text, structure, and context of the securities laws offer a straightforward route to reversal.
Congress has created for SEC court actions a tiered system of civil money penalties that does not include disgorgement. Congress has also given the SEC authority for an order requiring accounting and disgorgement, using those very words, in an -- in an administrative proceeding but no similar authority for court actions. And Congress has given other agencies clear textual authority for judicial disgorgement orders.
Using traditional tools of statutory construction, the result is clear: The SEC can seek the authorized penalties but no others. Second, the statute's allowance for equitable relief does not help the SEC because penalties are not equitable relief.
That has been the law for centuries. There is no principal distinction between the characteristics that make SEC disgorgement a penalty under Kokesh and those that make it a penalty under the old equity rule.
Its purpose is to punish disobedience of a public law.
Any return of money or property to those injured by the violation is discretionary at best and often never happens. Third, the phrase ""equitable relief,"" enacted as part of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, did not ratify circuit court cases that had approved SEC disgorgement.
Those cases, beginning with Texas Gulf Sulphur, did not look to statutory text.
They certainly did not settle the meaning of text that did not even exist yet. Instead, we have here only congressional silence, and silence does not give an agency any authority to act, much less the authority to punish. Mr. Rapawy, you started out by saying Kokesh labeled this a penalty and equity doesn't enforce penalties and that's it. But Kokesh was in a specific context. It said, for statute of limitations purposes, it is a penalty.
For a different purpose, it need not be characterized as -- as a penalty for determining whether the fraudster can retain the profits of the fraud.
That's something different. But the notion that because we categorize it in one context, disgorgement, as a penalty, does not necessarily carry over to another.
There was a great legal scholar who has been often quoted by this Court, Walter Wheeler Cook, who said the tendency to assume that a word appearing in two or more legal contexts and so in connection with more than one purpose -- one purpose is statute of limitations, another is depriving the fraudster of the profits of the fraud -- to assume that that characterization to B had historically been regarded as seeking legal relief, not equitable relief. And then, as Mr. Rapawy was saying, the Court in Great-West emphasized that, yes, there are some sorts of legal remedies.
They're not considered inherently equitable, but courts of equity could sometimes award them as a matter ancillary to their equitable jurisdiction.
And the Court said, at least under ERISA, that's not what equitable relief meant. I -- I don't think disgorgement can really be portrayed in that way.
I mean, obviously, in Kansas versus Nebraska, the Court ordered disgorgement as -- treated disgorgement as inherently equitable relief.
And one sign that it regarded disgorgement as equitable rather than legal was it said it is an appropriate exercise of authority to enter partial disgorgement.
Yes, we would have authority to issue -- require the defendant to hand over the full amount of its profits, but, under the circumstances of the case, we think an adequate deterrent purpose would be served by requiring Nebraska to hand over a fraction of its profits but far from the whole. That -- that's the kind of equitable discretion that the -- that's the kind of discretionary judgment that is inherent in equity. The other thing I would say about Mr. Rapawy's argument with respect to Livingston and the patent cases, I mean, before the Court had specific statutory authority to do so, in cases like Livingston, the Court held that a defendant's profits were the -- were an appropriate element of relief in a patent infringement suit.
And the defendant was not acting as a fiduciary or trustee; the defendant was simply committing a wrong using an invention in which the plaintiff had a property right, and that was found to be an appropriate element of relief.
And the Court in Livingston said it is not permissible for a court of equity to also award interest because that would be a penalty. Now I think our legal system regards interest differently than it did back in the day, but I think the general principle from Livingston remains sound.
That is, if a court were to compute disgorgement in accordance with traditional equitable principles, both the general rule that net profits are the measure and any established equitable exceptions to that rule, if the court computed its -- a disgorgement award in that manner and then said I'm tacking on another 50 percent because your behavior was so egregious, we would agree that that would be a penalty.
That would be something that would not be an appropriate exercise of equitable authority under Section 21(d)(5). It -- it could still be done in the SEC cases, because the Congress has authorized civil penalties in addition to equitable relief, but it could not be justified as an exercise of equitable authority.
But that's not what -- what's being done in this case. What do you do with the Ninth Circuit saying there were no legitimate expenses to -- to deduct, to arrive at net profit? I -- they -- they allowed us a very small deduction for the amount that remained in the corporate account and could be distributed to investors, and, certainly, that would always be an appropriate deduction, any -- any benefit that the investors received at the end of the day. But there were basically two categories of expenses that the Ninth Circuit and the district court didn't allow.
One was for the overseas marketing attempts.
And I think that was simply the -- the type of expense that Justice Breyer was talking about.
This was money spent to perpetrate the fraud, money spent to try to induce other investors to pay their money into what was an -- essentially a fraud -- pervasively a fraudulent scheme. The other was Mr. Rapawy is correct that some of the money was spent on things like equipment, facilities, things that in another context might have qualified as legitimate business expenses had there been a true intent to construct a cancer treatment facility and do what the marketer said they were going to do. What the district court said -- and I believe this is on page 18a of the Petition Appendix -- it characterized those expenses as a half-hearted attempt to convey the illusion of progress. And so the court's analysis on that point was not extensive, but -- but we take the point to have been these were not legitimate business expenses because they didn't represent a true good-faith effort to construct the relevant facility.
They simply represented an effort to fool investors into thinking that things were going along as planned. And those -- those findings were certainly subject to being reviewed on appeal. We would agree that, had the investors had it in their minds to construct the facility and it just didn't pan out at the end of the day, those would have been the sorts of things that could have been used as deductions. But given the conclusion of the lower courts that this was a pervasively fraudulent scheme in which essentially all of the expenses were made to perpetrate the fraud, then we think it's in accordance with traditional equitable principles to allow no deductions. But, again, the point we had stressed most strongly is we think that Congress has authorized courts to award disgorgement as computed under traditional rules of equity. If in a particular case or even if in some larger category of cases the Court believes that exorbitant disgorgement has been awarded, then the proper response is be more careful about -- to tell lower courts be more careful about the computation. It -- it couldn't under any circumstances be a justification for holding that Congress has not authorized disgorgement at all. If there -- there are no further questions, we would urge the Court to affirm. Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Rapawy. Thank you, Your Honor.
I will be brief. On the question of Kansas versus Nebraska, I believe that the Court was explicitly in that case exercising its authority in the singular sphere of interstate relations to craft a new remedy.
It was not applying traditional equitable principles. There was a dispute between the majority and the dissent about whether it was appropriate to adopt Section 39 of the third restatement, but, either way, that was a case of the Court making a new remedy that did not previously historically exist. And that would not be appropriate to do here, where you are interpreting a statute in which Congress has already set forth a detailed remedial scheme. On the question of the calculation of the individuals -- of the amounts of disgorgement, there are explicit findings in this record as to the gross pecuniary gain to each individual.
It's 6.7 for Mr. Liu and it is 1.5 million for -- for Ms. Wang. And if you are applying the traditional historical approach, you would start at the gain to each defendant -- to each defendant.
You wouldn't start at the total losses to investors and take deductions from there.
And I think that goes to show how far the -- the -- both -- both what happened in this individual case and also how far the analysis that's going on here is from the historical approach. I think the scope of disgorgement has grown over time in part because it is not grounded in statutory text, and that counsel's for returning it to Congress rather than crafting a new remedy and -- and -- by -- as a sort of adapting equitable principles. I think its practical function has been to compel payments to the Treasury.
There is no historical precedent for that.
I would cite to the Court's Gabelli case, in which the Court found that there was no precedent for applying the equitable doctrine of the discovery rule to -- to cases by the government. So, too, here, there's no precedent for using an accounting to compel funds be paid to the Treasury. Finally -- What -- what about the statutes that assume the availability of disgorgement? Those statutes would have no work to do if -- if the Court can order disgorgement absent express statutory authority? We tried to show in our opening brief, Your Honor, that -- that most of those statutes do have some work to do.
There are one or two that don't. Even in those cases, I would say that those statutes at most reflect a presupposition or awareness by Congress that courts were doing this, not an authorization, and authorization is what's needed to authorize -- to inflict a penalty. Finally, if the Court does conclude that some remedy may survive -- may survive in some case, I would urge it, nevertheless, to reverse and not to remand in this case. These individuals have already been ordered to pay their entire gross pecuniary gains, and anything above and beyond that would go beyond the equitable principle that no individual should be -- should be permitted to profit from his or her own wrong. And with that, Your Honors, I would respectfully request the Court reverse. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-8369, Lomax versus Ortiz-Marquez. Mr. Burgess. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are not strikes under Section 1915(g) for three reasons. First, the statute uses a familiar legal phrase with a well-established meaning in the context relevant here.
When courts review judicial orders to determine their impact on a future action, evaluating preclusion, for example, they conclusively presume that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" means dismissed with prejudice. In 1915(g), Congress used the same phrase in the same basic context.
There's every reason to think Congress expected courts to apply the phrase's settled meaning rather than to convert ordinary without-prejudice dismissals into sanctions that restrict future suits. Second, the structure of the PLRA further supports that interpretation.
Read together, the three dismissal categories identified in 1915(g) target actions that are facially meritless or otherwise abusive. Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are different.
They may be based on purely procedural defects, such as the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and it would be odd to impose a strike for such suits since Congress excluded from 1915(g)'s reach other categories of dismissals that don't implicate the merits or otherwise suggest abuse, such as dismissals based on sovereign immunity. Third and related, the other side's interpretation upsets the PLRA's balance by punishing prisoners for dismissals that, by definition, say nothing about the ultimate merits of their action.
This interpretation frustrates the Act's objective to filter out bad claims while still allowing for consideration of the good, since it restricts a prisoner's ability to bring a potentially legitimate claim even after the prisoner has cured a procedural defect. I'd like to start with the text of the statute.
The -- the other side's lead argument is that the term ""dismiss"" is sufficiently capacious to encompass both dismissals with prejudice or dismissals without prejudice as a -- as a dictionary matter.
And we don't disagree with that proposition, but we don't think that argument takes adequate account of the full statutory phrase at issue here and the context in which it is being used. You -- you are assuming that the preclusion question and the IFP status go hand in hand, but it could well be that a dismissal without prejudice will not have preclusive effect, but, at the same time, it could mean that you have to pay the filing fee. You -- you seem to be assuming that these two go hand in hand, but that's not necessarily so. I think it's true that they are analytically separable.
You could imagine having a consequence in the latter circumstance even if there wouldn't be a preclusion consequence, but the point of our argument is that in the particular context where it is be -- this phrase is being used in 1915(g), where you're looking to the consequence a dismissal has on the ability to bring a future action, that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" has frivolous, malicious, failure to state a claim, the first two are plainly pejorative.
I mean -- I mean, the -- the -- the -- the system does impose -- filings that aren't meritorious impose costs on the system.
But, at the same time, the words are -- are of a different character. I mean, if you -- if you file -- if your case is thrown out because it's frivolous or malicious, that's one thing.
If -- if it's thrown out because of a failure to state a claim, when you report that to your -- your -- your colleagues back at the -- the firm, they're going to say, well, is it without prejudice or with? And if you say it's without prejudice, they -- they're not going to think you're a bad lawyer.
I mean, they're just going to think that you've got to refile after something else happens. Precisely.
And so, when Congress, in adding the language on failure to state a claim, was expanding the type of claims that judges would be positioned to dismiss under the PLRA and was not saying they have to be those that are -- are vexatious in some manner. They can be those that are simply deficient. And that takes me to I think what is an important point I do want to get to, is if we look at the -- the dismissals in this case, two of them are Heck dismissals, and there's a suggestion that these are without prejudice, as Heck dismissals normally are in -- in most circuits, because of their -- their status. The inmate here, who, as I say, was in prison for a felony conviction on sexual assault, he files a lawsuit in 2013 against five judges, two prosecutors, and the claims are that -- that he was deprived of proper bail, proper speedy trial, the sentence was no good and that he was denied a -- a -- an appeal. And that's a Heck dismissal.
It's a failure to state a claim because no relief can be granted on that.
Nor is there any likelihood that in the future this prisoner is likely to be able to cure that, that is to say, there's no indication that he has a habeas petition that's been ruled on favorably or the like. So it can be styled as a procedural issue, but, for all practical purposes, it's likely to ever change, but it's without prejudice.
And the consequence -- and I think this goes to a question Justice Kavanaugh asked -- is why would it be a -- a better rule, I think you asked of my colleague from Colorado? Why would it be a better rule is because, if we say that ones without prejudice are not going to be strikes, that means, in effect, Heck dismissals will not count as strikes and inmates may file an unlimited number, in terms of not paying a filing fee, an unlimited number of IFP actions without consequence. And common sense will tell you that instead of the statutory purpose, which is to have fewer but better claims, we will wind up with an unlimited number of Heck -- Well, I suppose -- -- Heck actions. -- I suppose in that scenario at some point the filings would become malicious. At -- at some point. There's obviously precedent from this Court in the In Re McDonnell and subsequent cases where some of the excessive litigants have come to this Court and the Court has said enough, and lower courts have done something similar, but those are really aberrations.
Those are not the norm.
And nor would we want the system to have to bear -- General -- -- that. -- the system bears that anyway, given that at least your co-counselor or counsel on the -- on your side argue that courts are free to permit litigants to amend their complaints. Litigants can do exactly that.
They can avoid the filing fee and they can avoid dismissal by continuously amending and some courts permit it.
At some point, they get tired and they dismiss with prejudice. That would happen the same with inappropriate Heck dismissals.
As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you dismiss one.
The court tells you Heck bars you.
And you refile it again with no change, and the court is going to dismiss it as frivolous. You -- you may answer briefly. Thank you. Respectfully, the history since the PLRA was enacted shows -- shows otherwise.
At its zenith, 25 percent of the civil docket of -- of the federal courts were prisoner filings, and it is now down to about 10 percent.
It's still a very large number, approximately 29,000 a year ago, but it's from 20 -- 25 percent to 10 percent. And in the majority of circuits, I think it's six of eight that have ruled on this, the rule is both with and without prejudice count. Thank you, General. Four minutes, Mr. Burgess. Thank you.
I'd like to make a few quick points. First, Mr. Olson a number of times in his presentation referred to 1915(g) referring to -- dealing with actions that were dismissed as non-meritorious on their face.
They make the same point in their brief. But it is very odd to refer to a dismissal without prejudice that may be based on purely a procedural defect as suggesting the claim is non-meritorious on its face. And I suggest the reason they need to characterize it that way is precisely along the lines that the Chief Justice alluded to.
The other phrases in 1915(g) are referring to actions that are clearly abusive, malicious, or frivolous. So it does not fit with the structure of the statute to think that actions that are being dismissed without prejudice and that might be on a purely procedural ground should receive a sanction under 1915(g). I'd like -- also like to address the United States' argument about the literal text of the statute and the idea that, well, it just says failure to state a claim, we shouldn't be reading in another provision.
But that doesn't take full account of the fact that this is a term of art. And this Court in Woodford, for example, where it was interpreting the phrase ""exhaust,"" the argument was made, well, that doesn't include proper exhaustion.
And the Court said, nevertheless, ""exhaustion"" is a legal term.
We know what it means.
So it would have been redundant for Congress to have to say proper exhaustion. We think the same applies here in the particular context where you're dealing with what a court interprets a prior dismissal. And for that reason, we think the Coleman decision supports us because Coleman, in addition to relying on the plain language, relied on the ordinary background principles of Civil Rules of Procedure. And, here, the ordinary background rule is that, while Rule 12(b), an authorization provision, allows for a dismissal with or without prejudice, when you are determining the impact of -- of a dismissal after it has previously been entered, it is -- there's a conclusive presumption that it is with prejudice. So we think Congress would have understood it that way.
And that fully explains the -- the difference between why the phrase is being interpreted one way in 1915(g) as opposed to the screening provisions, which mirror 12(b) in authorizing dismissal. Another point I'd like to make is I didn't hear a good response to Justice Kavanaugh's question as to why there would be a good reason to treat differently actions that -- instances in which a court allows amendment and then dismisses versus instances in which the court decides, well, I'm just going to dismiss this entire action without prejudice. And the other side's argument seems to rely on the notion that courts will by and large apply Rule 15 and allow multiple amendments.
As I indicated before, it's not clear that that is a preferable system.
And I think it's also not clear that that is consistent with the text of the PLRA. When you look at the screening provisions, in particular 1915(e) and 1997(e), they speak in terms of requiring the court to dismiss the action or the case. So the idea that they can cure the problem that their reading has by saying, well, courts are going to allow multiple amendments, so you don't have to worry about instances in which there is a without-prejudice dismissal, I don't think is consistent with how the -- the Act works as a whole. The final point I'd like to make is that the other side alluded multiple times to the -- how many prisoner suits there were and that they've decreased. As we noted in our reply brief, there's no indication that there is any different pattern in the Third or Fourth Circuit.
The Fourth Circuit has had this rule for over a decade and there's no indication that by adopting a clear rule that without-prejudice dismissals do not qualify as strikes, that there's been any significant uptick in prisoner litigation. If the Court has no further questions, we urge you to reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear first this morning in Case 18-1086, Lucky Brand Dungarees versus Marcel Fashions Group. Ms. Cendali. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should reverse the Second Circuit because it erred in holding that a defense never previously litigated to judgment can be barred in a case involving new claims. This Court rejected that idea over a hundred years ago in Cromwell and Davis, and as this Court unanimously made clear more recently in Taylor v. Sturgell, the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue preclusion, which forecloses relitigation of issues actually litigated and resolved, and claim preclusion, which forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim. Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free to argue any previously unresolved defense it may have to new claims.
This rule is right for three reasons: First, it follows from this Court's precedent, including Cromwell, Davis, and Taylor. Second, the rule is easy to administer as courts and litigants are accustomed to applying these bedrock principles of issue and claim preclusion. Third, it's fair and protects due process interests. To be clear, we are not arguing that defenses may never be barred under existing law. Issue preclusion could bar a previously resolved defense.
And previously unresolved defenses cannot be raised in the context of a judgment enforcement action or as a claim in an action collaterally attacking a prior judgment. But none of these circumstances are present here.
As the Second Circuit held in the first appeal in this case, Marcel I, Marcel is pursuing new claims as it seeks relief for alleged subsequent infringement.
Thus, this Court should reverse, as the Second Circuit's novel test precluded a never-resolved defense in an action asserting new claims in conflict with settled and sensible principles of claim and issue preclusion. Moreover, the Second Circuit's new test is a bad idea. Before we get to that, Ms. Cendali, could you explain why you abandoned the release defense in the first action? You did raise it, and then you dropped it.
And it's a bit of a mystery why you did. We don't know exactly why it was abandoned, but it -- the most logical answer is that it would not have been dispositive.
The amount in controversy -- the -- the compensatory damages in that case was only $20,000, and we know that the release would not have applied to use of ""Get Lucky,"" which is what the primary thrust of what the case was about.
So it may not have been worth it from a cost-benefit analysis to renew a release to -- a defense that would not have been dispositive of the -- the issues before -- before the court. How would it have -- it seems strange when that release said, Lucky, you can't use ""Get Lucky,"" but you're continuing to use it.
The release said you can't use ""Get Lucky."" On the other hand, we won't go after you for Lucky Brand.
And the first case, as you just of ""Lucky Brand."" And then we get in this post-settlement where Marcel is saying, yes, we're going to go after ""Lucky Brand,"" even though in the settlement we said we wouldn't. And -- and, Your Honor, the -- the explanation for this is twofold.
The first is Marcel became aware that Lucky was violating the terms of the settlement agreement and that it was continuing to use the ""Get Lucky"" designation. And two examples of this after the settlement agreement appear on page 8 of our red brief.
Its theory then became -- and this is where, Justice Kagan, you raised the potential factual distinctions between the cases.
They're not actually distinctions. Our theory became, one, if you're going to -- first, Lucky sued Marcel on the basis that was also released in the 2003 suit. Lucky -- Marcel then filed counterclaims and part of the theory of the counterclaims was if you're mixing the two marks together then the facts that underlie the settlement before are no longer true, and, indeed, the public may now be confused into thinking that ""Get Lucky,"" in fact, belongs to Lucky Brand.
We would make those same factual arguments in this case. Mr. -- can I -- can I go back to the law for a second? Because here's where I really think we are in this case. Second Circuit issues this decision.
And as Justice Breyer said, this decision -- we've -- you -- we've never really seen anything like this because the Second Circuit said that there was defense preclusion even in the context of new claims. You admitted that yourself, that the Second Circuit wasn't clear enough about the fact that it couldn't be a new claim.
That's because the Second Circuit never said it had to be a new claim. So the Second Circuit's ruling -- It did hold that they were -- -- excuse me -- -- were the same thing. -- goes far beyond that and applies to new claims.
So now you -- you think, well, that's got to be wrong.
So we have to limit it to old claims. So I'll just -- you know, we'll say that this is the old claim.
It's the same transaction or occurrence.
But if it were the same transaction or occurrence, you couldn't bring your second suit. Now then you say, yes, you can, because I can bring a second suit even if it is the same transaction or occurrence because I didn't have the opportunity -- Right. -- to bring it before. But nobody's ever heard of that.
The reason that you can bring a second suit is because this is a different transaction or occurrence. Your Honor, in fact, the arguments that you just described were at the heart of our arguments in the first case. And if I would, I -- I'd point the Court just to two footnotes from the court's -- the Second Circuit's decision in this case.
It's footnote 7 at appendix page -- petition appendix page 18 to 19, where the court says that this action and the prior action ""surround related transactions or occurrences."" It's saying that this is the same cause of action. Footnote 10 on page -- It said related. Related isn't the same. Your Honor, that is, in fact, a statement -- the -- the statement from restatement section 24 is connected, but I think related and connected are substantively the same.
And the court then at paragraph -- excuse me, on petition appendix 21, in footnote 10 -- may I finish -- explains why its decision in the first case -- in the first appeal and in this appeal are consistent. And it says, Your Honor, exactly what you just said, that the reason that the claims here are permitted is because they weren't available in the first suit, not because they are different claims in the sense that they arise from a different nucleus of operative fact, because they can't. The allegations here is it's a continuing course of conduct.
And the only reason they were permissible is because, that in fact, they were unavailable.
That is clear on the face of the opinion and I -- we think applying that opinion requires affirmance. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Ms. Cendali. Thank you. Two series of points, one relating to the question presented on the rule of law, the new rule of law, and one relating to the new claim argument. One of the striking things about Marcel's argument is that there was no defense of the basic principle, as Justice Breyer was saying, that -- that you can have a new -- in the case where there is a new claim, a previously unlitigated, unresolved defense can be excluded. But he says -- he points correctly to two cases.
One was the one Justice Alito mentioned, the landlord case, and the other was the Bond case and in both cases -- you understand.
You probably read those cases. Right.
And so -- And what's -- -- let's talk -- What's your answer to that? Right.
But let's -- but let's -- let's talk about that.
First, it shouldn't be forgotten at page 17 of their brief, they say that a preclusion of a defense requires that the causes of action be the same. That's basic civil procedure.
I learned that in professor Arthur Miller's class. The case that they cited then was City of Beloit.
City of Beloit, as Justice Sotomayor said, is our case, because that was a case when there was a judgment that the city had to pay, it then brought a suit in equity to try to get from out of that judgment.
That is not a case involving the facts here of a new claim. And, moreover, to the extent that there's loose remarks going in that direction in that case, that was specifically dealt with by the majority opinion in Cromwell, which surveyed all the law up to that point and, specifically, while it didn't cite City of Beloit by name, it specifically explained away Henderson v. Henderson, which was the main case City of Beloit relied on saying Henderson v. Henderson was also a collateral attack case and doesn't rely on it. Later that term in another opinion by Justice Field, Rogers v. -- excuse me, Davis v. Brown, City of Beloit, excuse me, and Cromwell was only cited by the defense, which is telling. What about the -- what about the rent? The rent? The -- the landlord sues the tenant for rent on a lease and wins. And then later on, the tenant doesn't pay again, so he -- okay, he, sues him again on the lease and this time the defendant wants to say the lease is invalid and the court said no, you can't, because you should have said that before. Because to the extent that that case is -- is a new claim, they should be able to bring that.
There's an ongoing course of -- of conduct then -- then -- and you were made whole from the first nonpayment -- So that isn't the question, because everybody agrees it's a new course of conduct.
But this was a defense.
And they said you can't raise the defense.
And then Wright and Miller is a little worried about that.
They say, well, this is a question about estoppel.
And -- so -- so that seemed like a point on his side.
What about those cases? Well, it -- well, none of the cases, none of the cases cited in their brief, are on -- these facts.
With regard to the rent case, if it's -- if it means what was just said, then it's just wrong and not consistent with law.
And -- Counsel, let's assume that they had actually litigated, you had actually litigated whether the use of ""Lucky Brand"" trademarks, without the use of ""Get Lucky,"" was an infringement on the superior ""Get Lucky"" mark.
Let's assume the Court had said it's an infringement for you to do that.
No permanent injunction.
We're just going to give damages. Then there's now a new lawsuit that says you're continuing, after the old one, to use the ""Lucky Brand"" trademarks in the same way.
That's how they are pitching this to us, okay? Now you should be precluded because you had a full and fair opportunity to raise the settlement agreement as your right to use the ""Lucky Brands."" You didn't.
Why should you raise it now? That -- I think that that's the case that they say this is. Right. And assuming that were the case, you had a full and fair opportunity to litigate your use of ""Lucky Brands"" without ""Get Lucky,"" and the jury found that your use was an infringement, how could you then defend this case? May I answer? Yes. Well, you would defend it because the case sought subsequent relief for subsequent infringements where you would be allowed to present new defenses to that different period of time.
In the absence of a forward-looking injunction, it's a -- a new case.
Future facts could not have been before the court.
And that's the answer. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1023, Maine Community Health Options versus United States, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a massive government bait-and-switch and the fundamental question of whether the government has to keep its word after its money-mandating promises have induced reliance. The government suggests that there is no such thing as an enforceable congressional promise and that even the clearest command to pay money is subject to a caveat that it's subject to appropriations, and reliance, even on clear language, is ""inherently unreasonable."" That position is inconsistent with all this Court's cases, including the ones that go the government's way by finding an implied repeal for, in the government's view, there is nothing to repeal.
Simply failing to appropriate the money cancels the obligation. The government's position would also make it impossible to accomplish many important government objectives that require a clear and enforceable promise to pay, as this case well illustrates. When Congress made the health benefit exchanges a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, it faced a problem.
The exchanges depended on the participant of private health insurance companies, and those companies were being asked to insure previously uninsured people on unprecedented terms. The natural reaction of the insurers would have been to charge a substantial premium to account for the uncertainties, but that premium would have worked against the government in two fundamental ways.
First, it would have made the policies relatively unaffordable, contrary to the whole purpose of the Affordable Care Act; and, second, the government would have ended up paying for those heightened premiums through tax subsidies. So the risk corridor programs at issue here was an important component of the government's solution to the problem.
The program depended on a clear and enforceable promise that the government would pay for a portion of any losses incurred by the health insurance companies that stepped forward. In order for that promise to work, it had to be clear and enforceable.
If the government had simply said we will make these risk corridor payments subject to appropriations, the promise would have made no difference whatsoever. If all the insurance companies were doing was trading the uncertainties about the risk pool for the uncertainties over the funding priorities of future Congresses, they would have gained nothing in the process.
So Congress made a clear money-mandating promise to pay. Based on that promise, my clients and others got state-approved rates to offer policies on the exchanges.
After those rates were already set, then HHS adopted its so-called transitional policy, which kept some healthy people off the exchanges and, as the government itself recognized, meant that more insurers would lose more money.
But HHS said to the insurers: Don't worry, we have the risk corridors program in place, and we will cover some of those excess losses as a result of the transitional policy. So the policies went forward and losses were incurred, and when it became time to pay, the government then that's a fair characterization because just like -- just like any -- just like any program where Congress directs the Secretary of whatever department to establish a program, the Secretary can't go forward with that without appropriations. That includes a subsidy program.
That includes a regulatory program, all manner of programs.
And that's what happened here.
It would be a dramatic change for this Court to say that when -- when Congress says that an agency shall establish a program and pay out money under that, that if Congress declines to appropriate the money for it, that gives rise to a implied cause of action in the -- under the Tucker Act. We have three reasons why that shouldn't be so.
Justice Ginsburg's point that -- against implied causes of action, the Amtrak case that says an act of Congress is not to be construed to create contractual or -- or vested rights in private persons, and the appropriations clause and its implementation in 1302(d) that says, absent a clear statement, an Act shall not be -- not be read to be an appropriation or to provide contract authority. The result the Petitioners seek here is essentially to make 1342 an appropriation as the source of money to be paid out under the Judgment Fund, but the Judgment Fund is available only if there's a violation.
And there's no violation to begin with. But even if -- even if you thought that there was a -- a commitment, a binding commitment of some sort, the Appropriations Act here, Congress clearly intended not to -- not to provide for payment. So I think in respect for the way in which appropriations have been understood and Congress's power over appropriations have been understood for hundreds of years, it's important for this Court to not impose monetary -- an implied monetary liability under -- under the -- under the Tucker Act and to extend Langston from its very modest context of a salary to which the statute said he was entitled, language that is not present here, to impose liability on the government in billions of dollars not -- It's a modest context -- -- subject to a funding -- -- but isn't it the same principle? I don't think it is the same principle because -- And the distinction is the salary? The salary of someone who is working for the government, and one -- the statute said he was entitled to it.
Again, we don't have that here.
But even without that language, I think one would -- one would think of someone working for the government, he's delivering services to the government, the pay that is owed him, is -- is in reciprocity for that. That's far different from a subsidy program in which -- in which Congress without a contract, without a bilateral relationship, without an individualized promise, has made money available under a generalized subsidy program. That's -- that is a huge, huge difference.
And all the cases in Justice Scalia's opinion, dissenting opinion in Bowen versus Massachusetts, are employment cases, and -- and he's saying, yes, you can go to the Tucker Act on employment cases.
But -- but that's vastly different from the statutory arrangement we have here. Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Five minutes, Mr. Clement. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to just start off with Justice Kagan's point that the government takes the payment in obligation with the exact same language to be absolutely mandatory. And I assure you, if one of my clients when presented with a bill said, well, we have a bunch of internal rules at our company and I actually can't disburse the funds until I get approval from the treasury division at our company, I don't think the government would be impressed by that and they certainly wouldn't say that the mandatory obligation just somehow disappeared because the rule said we didn't have the funds to pay it at that particular moment. I'd also like to talk about the ""subject to appropriations"" language because that's not just a feature of many other provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
I asked one of my associates to look at how many times that appears in the U.S. Code.
When he gave me 200, I told him he could stop. This is a recurring provision in the U.S. Code and they would wipe out 200 references to subject of appropriations, they would mean absolutely nothing. Text matters here.
Obviously, they don't want to talk about the text of the appropriations riders because the text doesn't have language that says repeal, it doesn't limit payments out to payments in.
It doesn't even have the ""this or any other act"" language that was at issue in Will or Dickerson. And to be clear, that's not because Congress forgot how to use that phrase.
The same 2015 Appropriations Act had multiple provisions that failed to appropriate funds and said no funds available under this or any other act. There were also provisions in that same 2015 appropriations bill that expressly repealed substantive provisions.
So Congress knows how to repeal.
It knows how to emphatically limit funds.
It didn't do that here. Another point that I want to make clear here is just my friend has used the term ""subsidy"" a lot in describing this program. This really doesn't feel like a subsidy because nobody -- none of my clients get paid a penny unless they suffer actual losses. So this is not a great subsidy program if the only way you can get paid a penny is if you lose lots of money by losing money by providing your products on the exchanges.
So what I would describe this program as is essentially more like an insurance program. The government says we very much want you to do this, and if you do it and lose money in the process, we shall pay a percentage of your losses.
That's why this retroactivity here is so pernicious, because what could be worse than getting an insurance policy and at the point that you actually suffer a loss and try to make a claim, they say: Oh, I'm sorry, we -- we -- we just decided we weren't going to fund that policy, even though you performed, even though you suffered actual losses.
So I really wouldn't describe this as a subsidy program. My friend on the other side suggested that there's no case law one way or another on this.
I just respectfully disagree. I think White Mountain Apache, I think Mitchell, the 1983 Mitchell decision, sometimes referred to as Mitchell II, are cases where this Court said there's money mandating directly from a statute.
And those were Indian trust cases where the direction was much less specific than this. You shall administer this property in a trust.
And the Court found an action there. There, you really had to do some inferring and some implying to get to the cause of action, not so with respect to this kind of direct ""shall pay"" obligation. My friend also relied a lot on the Amtrak case.
I think it's worth taking a closer look at that case, because the kind of contract at issue there was the kind of contract that would essentially bind the federal government in perpetuity and prevent them even from taking action prospectively. So, there, it was basically about whether the employees of the railroads that got consolidated into Amtrak were going to get essentially a free pass for life.
And the Court in that context said, well, we don't want to bind future Congresses forever on that. But this is different.
This is whether you're going to be bound to a contract where the counterparty has already performed to their detriment.
And in those circumstances, I don't think there should be any special rule. Again, I think the two paragraphs in the Bowen dissent are exactly right.
I think this is a unilateral contract that's accepted through performance, and then the government has to pay. But, if for some reason you think you don't get a contract unless the statute says the word contract, then you just treat it as a statutory obligation to pay. My friend said that all those cases that Justice Scalia relied on are salary cases. That's not actually true.
There are also pension benefit cases there for pensions that are available or special benefits that are available to law enforcement officers and firefighters.
So this is not some principle that's been limited strictly to the context of salary provisions. And my final point is on what Congress was trying to accomplish here.
There is no question that they wanted to get the insurance companies to provide these policies.
But there is equally no question that they wanted the premiums to be relatively low. And in thinking about the billions of dollars that this failure to uphold their obligations is going to cost the government, you shouldn't lose sight of the fact that they also saved billions of dollars in tax subsidies by reducing the premiums through this -- through this commitment. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-9526, McGirt versus Oklahoma. Mr. Gershengorn. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is resolved by the fundamental proposition that decisions about sovereign rights are for Congress to make and Congress makes those decisions by speaking clearly in the text.
The decision below must be reversed because the text makes clear that Congress never terminated the Creek reservation and never transferred federal criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma. I have four basic points to make this morning.
First, the Creek Nation had a reservation.
The relevant treaties reserved the lands from sale and solemnly guaranteed the lands for the Creek to govern.
The text of both treaties and statutes expressly identified the Creek land as a reservation.
Nothing more was needed. Second, Congress did not establish -- disestablish that reservation.
Indeed, Congress considered hallmark language of disestablishment and rejected it.
Congress initially sought cession yet instead provided only for allotment. Then, when congressional inaction would have dissolved the tribe, Congress instead preserved the tribe and its government for all purposes authorized by law, and it did so against the backdrop of existing tribal authority to legislate over reservation land.
Those congressional judgments should be respected. Third, Congress did not transfer criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma.
At statehood, the Major Crimes Act established exclusive federal jurisdiction over enumerated crimes in ""any state of the United States."" When Congress overrides the Major Crimes Act and transfers jurisdiction to a state, it does so expressly, and it did not do so here. Finally, Oklahoma's rhetoric about disruption does not change the result.
On the criminal side, this Court's decision in Ramos is a complete answer, and on the civil side, the main issues are tax and other regulatory issues that are routinely resolved by tribal-state agreements.
In any event, Parker makes clear that questions of sovereignty are distinct from claims of reservation status. This Court should resolve the reservation question, leaving jurisdictional disputes to Congress, the relevant sovereign, and then for this Court to resolve if and when they arise. Counsel, the -- So let me start this -- -- State argues that the territory should be analyzed as a dependent Indian community under 1151 and not as a reservation.
They base this argument on our decisions in Sandoval and Creek Nation and 1151 itself and the fact that the Creeks have always maintained, have been adamant about the fact that they are not reservation Indians. Now you refer, of course, to the many times in which the treaty is referred to as a reservation, but what is your answer to the State's analysis of our precedent? So, Your Honor, I think both the precedent and the language support the idea that this is not a dependent Indian community.
What this Court said in Venetie and what Judge -- then Judge Gorsuch said in Hydro Resources is that the dependent Indian community label is a catchall for tribes that did not have a reservation and are not on restricted lands.
The best evidence of what Congress thought about whether Creek use of Indians as such under the superintendence of the government.
And that -- that phrase appeared in -- in Potawatomie in describing is there a difference between trusts and -- and reservations. So that the same general concept was there, except for a reservation, as opposed to an allotment, for example, it's -- it's owned collectively.
And so, when the land is broken up, as it was here, particularly when it's broken -- when it's fee land that is broken up and when someone conveys their interest in fee to -- to somebody else, they are conveying all of their interest in it.
It's not like trust property on the typical reservation where the -- where, when it's allotted, the United States retains an interest and, therefore, on behalf of the tribe in some sense, retains an interest. When it's fee land, it is conveyed out of the tribe and the tribe loses all of its interest in the land.
And that's particularly clear under this allotment agreement because it provides that the United States also extinguished -- by approving the deeds, extinguished its interest in the land.
And that interest was a reversionary interest for when the tribe was disappearing. And so, by -- by relinquishing the United States' interest in that land at the same time it was conveyed to the individual allottee, it made it clear that the tribe as sovereign was being -- its sovereign authority over that land was being eliminated. Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Justice Gorsuch? Mr. Kneedler, tell me what's wrong with this sequence of -- of -- of -- of my understanding, that Congress did establish something it called a reservation with respect to this property at some point in time, that through the 1890s and the early part of the last century, there was an awful lot of debate about how to -- how to end that reservation, whether they could end it in anticipation of Oklahoma becoming part of the Union. And that things got very complicated and they came mighty close to ending the reservation but never quite passed the kind of language that we typically see when that happens, reversion of all lands to the public domain or cessation or anything like that. In fact, the Dawes Commission couldn't -- admitted it couldn't quite get there.
And so you're really left to rely mostly on a lot of demographic evidence, both then and now, which, while not everybody's acting in good faith, not everybody -- not everybody's acting in bad faith too, as someone pointed out. And it's a mixed bag.
And it's very hard to make much of it.
And to rely too heavily on demographic evidence is dangerous because you in some -- in some ways incentivize people to ignore the plain terms of the law. And, for example, as I pointed out earlier, I think it was until the 1970s that Oklahoma continued to try and enforce state law against Native Americans on allotted territory. I believe I have that right. So tell me what's wrong with that understanding, please. Well, first of all, I think there's a big difference between demographics before and after statehood.
The -- the overwhelming presence of non-Indians in the territory was precisely the reason why Congress said it won't work to have tribal governments running this and tribes couldn't emphasize jurisdiction over the non-Indians. And what Congress said is, this area needs a government for and by both Indians and non-Indians, and it established that in the territory so that it could hand that arrangement over to the new state. And it was contest -- this Court's decisions say that the contemporaneous understanding of what Congress was doing is significant.
The original public meaning of what -- what was done, and everybody, the state understood it, the state -- or the -- the state obviously implemented its compact of statehood, the federal government understood it.
Delix Cohen understood it.
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs at the time said there's only a shell of the government -- of the tribal government left. The tribal chairman -- the tribal chief said the same thing, that all we are in a position to do is distribute the property. And that -- that is -- and even the case that Petitioners and -- and the tribe rely upon, the Harjo versus Kleppe, specifically says that the tribe lost its territorial sovereignty even though it had the authority to run its internal affairs.
So -- Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Kneedler. Good morning. I want to follow up on a question Justice Sotomayor asked and one Justice Gorsuch asked. Justice Sotomayor mentioned quite rightly the 1832 and 1833 treaties.
My understanding, however, was that the 1866 treaty made clear that those treaty rights were, I don't know if the word is superseded, but diminished because the tribes had aligned and made a treaty with the confederates -- Confederate States of America, and the treaty language in 1866 said that that had unsettled the treaty relations. Anything you want to add on the 1866 treaty, the relevance of that? Yeah, I -- I don't think it adds significantly to the point, except that it -- it reflected an assertion of a greater federal responsibility in the territory. And it was contemplated that Congress could pass laws governing the territory. I did want to make one point about practical consequences on the criminal side. Not only would -- would this jeopardize all the prior convictions on the state side, but it would impose great burdens on the federal government.
It's estimated a 1300 percent increase in criminal prosecutions brought in state court. And then, of course, for the state, there -- there would be questions of taxation and whatnot.
And -- and I don't think City of Sherrill, which has been suggested, is a solution to that. Can I ask one other question, Mr. Kneedler, to follow up on Justice Gorsuch. My understanding given the demographics as of 1890 was that it would be very hard to have a tribal government over the whole territory because of the population at the time. And my question is: What tribal authority, judicial authority, or legislative authority to your knowledge was exercised over the whole territory, including the white settlers, in 1890 through 1907? It -- it was that the tribes had no authority over the white settlers, which is why Congress put in place the -- the courts for the Indian territory and it put in place federal law, mostly incorporating Arkansas law, to govern Indians and non-Indians alike. And that is the regime that Congress passed on from the territory to the new state and the new state received and has been faithfully applying that ever since statehood. And -- Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Gershengorn, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
A number of things. Justice Gorsuch, first, you're exactly right.
This Court may not be able to determine which party had the better reading of events on the ground 120 years ago, but it is surely well-positioned to determine which party has a better reading of the text.
And on that score, I submit this case is not close. Second, Justice Ginsburg, two points. With respect to fee title, that was meant to be an additional protection because everyone understood the -- the imperfections in Indian title.
The Creek didn't even get their patent until 1852, 20 years after the reservation was -- was given.
Elimination of fee title does not eliminate treaty promises.
Those have to be disestablished through plain text. In addition, Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly right, the right, title, and interest language, which is the only text the other side can point to, conveys only proprietary interest, not sovereign interest, and so there is no textual transfer. There has been a lot of talk -- discussion this morning about irrespective of race.
It is -- one quick point on that. When Congress -- when -- in the Enabling Act in Section 13, what Congress put in place was the laws of the territory of Oklahoma, which did not have the supposedly magic language about ""irrespective of race."" That suggests that Congress well understood that the arguments the SG and Oklahoma are making on this score are -- are made up for today. Fourth, there was a lot of discussion about whether there's a compromise available on criminal jurisdiction.
There is not.
Justice Alito listed a number of factors for Mr. Kneedler.
One of the missing ones was the text. The text is very clear.
I was amazed that Mr. Kneedler said there was no basis for believing that there was -- ignoring the text. Nagonset said that is true.
Secretary Udall's memo listed seven states in which it were true. Finally, the numbers today are mind-boggling in the back of the envelope.
They don't appear in any of the briefs.
The only fixed number is 178 petitions.
That dwarfs Ramos. I understand the Court's concerns about jurisdictional consequences, but there are no serious disagreements that these disputes are common in Indian Country -- Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1109, McKinney versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State seeks to put James McKinney to death even though he's never once had a sentencing proceeding that complies with current law.
There are two separate paths for McKinney to win.
The path in question 1 argues that the Arizona Supreme Court reopened McKinney's sentencing proceeding.
The Ninth Circuit had earlier granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus and gave the State the option of either imposing a life sentence or seeking the death penalty again. The State chose the latter, which required brand new state action in the form of new sentencing.
The Arizona Supreme Court then did everything itself just as it had in 1996. That was wrong.
This Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst required a jury sentencing.
If McKinney were sentenced today, no one doubts he'd be entitled to a jury trial. The State claims this would open the floodgates.
But McKinney is not seeking to use Ring retroactively as a sword to challenge his earlier proceedings.
Rather, he's saying that when the State conducts a new proceeding, that sentencing must comply with current law. Otherwise, the implications would be frightening.
For example, a state could run a re-sentencing today in 2019 with a pre-Batson jury, with race-based jury strikes.
That can't be right. And the second path, set out in question 2, is for this Court to simply say that the Eddings violation in this case requires a remand to the trial court for sentencing and that the appellate court was wrong to perform that delicate task itself.
This breaks no new ground.
Indeed, this Court has, on five separate occasions since the 1982 Eddings decision, ordered resentencing for Eddings violations. Both paths get McKinney to the same destination, but they are separate.
Question 2 is limited to the small universe of Eddings violations and how to fix them.
And question 1, by contrast, is about when sentencing proceedings lose their finality and are reopened. I'm fine waiving the rest of my time if there are questions. Well, what -- what about Clemons? Because Clemons is a precedent of this Court that says that the appellate court can do reweighing.
Is that still good law? So we're on question 2. And -- Yes. -- and with respect to question 2, Clemons is not an Eddings case at all.
Clemons is a case about whether or not an aggravating circumstance can be subtracted from -- in a re -- in a resentencing proceeding. That's a much easier case than what the -- Right.
You say in your brief, erroneously including an invalid aggravating circumstance is fundamentally different from erroneously excluding a relevant mitigating circumstance.
Why? I don't understand that. Because what the Arizona Supreme Court task had to deal with here was a full-blown reweighing of everything, mitigating and aggravating circumstances, whereas subtracting one element is very different. And, indeed, we know this from Clemons itself, Justice Kavanaugh, because the very end of Clemons actually brackets this case.
It says, in a circumstance to the defendant, and in -- in particular, but I think as a matter of type.
To the extent that a harmless -- It's very similar, I think, is what you're arguing. Yes.
As a type, it is very similar, but I would never say that what we did was -- In -- in Clemons, they -- they're analyzed back to back. Yes.
Both options were left open by the court as available paths for appellate correction of trial court error in Clemons.
And we believe -- May -- I'm sorry, could -- -- may I ask you a question about the -- the -- the error wasn't saying we won't count this mitigator, because there was no causal connection.
And then the Arizona Supreme Court says the causal connection still counts.
It doesn't mean you can't consider the evidence.
But it gets very little weight because there's no causal connection. They're not taking the causal connection out of it.
They're saying this mitigator is affected by the absence of causal -- causal connection is still playing a factor. Yes.
And -- and this goes to what Eddings does and doesn't require. Eddings specifically says that minimal weight or low weight can be given, that the court was not saying how much weight needed to be given, but that something must be considered. And -- and that's -- and that we believe is entirely satisfied by the second independent review here. There's no standalone new Eddings error. Could -- you resisted Justice Kavanaugh a little bit when he was trying to equate the harmless error to this. And I think you started to say this was something more than harmless error review.
Is that correct? My argument was that it was -- this is -- we believe this gives more process than harmless error review, but that, as a type, this is very similar to harmless error, and to the extent that harmless error is an available correction -- So what's the more process? The -- What -- what's your definition of ""more process""? The more process is not analyzing -- as a part of harmless error, not analyzing what would an imaginary person have -- have done -- what would an imaginary set of judges or a jury done if this evidence had been considered but, instead, allow briefing and say we're going to now look at the evidence and make our determination. And that's what happened.
So it was a whole -- how would it have differed from the original appeal? In an original appeal -- In a direct -- Yeah.
In -- in independent review on direct, there's two significant categories of differences.
The first one that I didn't get to earlier is the scope of the sentencing issues that will be addressed in independent review. In the initial independent review here, the Petitioner challenged the nature of the special verdict, that it was read instead of written. And the second independent review, the Petitioner brought up a new standalone Eighth Amendment claim.
That second time around, that's not revisited because the only analysis goes to the narrow aggravation and mitigation issue. The aggravators are still accepted, for example, for the co-defendant, the striking of the existing aggravator before stays, and all that's done is a -- is a -- How would the process have differed for the issue that was identified as an error? If you focus down all the way on the consideration of the mitigation, there is a consideration of the mitigation in the same manner as the first time around, but that's zooming in past all the rest of the independent review and acknowledging that when you get down, that means we fixed it. We went back and looked at the thing that was identified as a problem, conducted the analysis without a causal nexus, and corrected the identified problem that the Ninth Circuit had said occurred in the Arizona Supreme Court. It's an appellate court correcting an appellate error on a built record.
There's never been an allegation of something that was excluded from the record that might make this case very different. And this is, we think, a straightforward application of Clemons and that this entire case is driven by Question Presented one. And I would point out that Petitioner has offered no grounding principle for what would replace direct versus collateral as the measure for retroactivity if this Court were to upend modern retroactivity. He has cited the phrase ""any time something is again subject to modification,"" but I don't think that's a fair statement of the Court's opinion in Jiminez. But, more importantly, it would turn any 2255 proceeding, in which a sentence was again at risk, could again be corrected or vacated, into a direct proceeding for retroactivity purposes. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Katyal. Thank you.
I'd like to begin with Clemons, which, of course, is only about question 2.
It doesn't answer question 1 for reasons Justice Sotomayor has said.
So four things about Clemons: Number one, it's a very limited decision.
It's a subtraction of one aggravating factor.
As I was saying to Justice Kavanaugh, this is the opposite.
This is everything happened.
The Ninth Circuit, this is at Petition Appendix page 59a, required a resentencing.
And then the State came in and asked for a full-blown independent review, using that phrase four times.
That's at Joint Appendix pages 385 to 89. And that's exactly what the Arizona Supreme Court did.
My friend said, oh, it was a limited proceeding, this and that.
Absolutely not.
It was more extensive, actually, than the 1996 first independent review when they came back in 2016 and did it. They considered, for example, the aggravators and weighed them, at Petition Appendix pages 4a and 7a. Now, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked me about Justice Blackmun's dissent, which I had an occasion to look at again just now.
And Justice Blackmun's dissent is about one thing, which is the consideration of aggravating factors. And he said that's something that should be done by the trial court.
And, you know, whether he was right or wrong about that, that was only about aggravating factors. Our point to you in all of the decisions are about the consideration at the trial court of mitigating circumstances. So, for example, Mills at page 375 says, ""because the sentencers' failure to consider all of the mitigating evidence risks erroneous imposition of the death sentence, it's our duty to remand for resentencing."" And there's case after case about that.
Why is an aggravating circumstance different than a mitigating one? Because mitigating ones go to mercy, in which this Court in Caldwell has said that's the thing in which you need the jury to see, or -- or at least the trial court, to see upfront and personal as opposed to on a cold record. And that's why we don't think, you know, you should extend Clemons, particularly given this Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst and Haymond, all of which suggest that really juries have a fundamental role here. Now, with respect to question 1, our point to you is that resentencing was required by the Ninth Circuit.
They got a full-blown resentencing. We're not challenging -- he has some argument about a DIG.
We're not -- it wasn't in the briefs in opposition or below.
We're not challenging the Ninth Circuit's determination. We're challenging the Arizona Supreme Court's decision here to not comply with the law of this Court, Eddings and Jiminez, which reopened the conviction. Now, if you accept their view, you're going to basically license a state to slap the label of collateral review on and allow them to conduct new sentencing proceedings that will evade Batson, that will undermine everything that Justice Harwin tried to do when he tried to overrule -- when he overruled Linkletter.
And they'll be able to pick cases and say, oh, this time it won't be final.
That time it will. That's a very dangerous thing. I agree there are difficult cases, and my friend ended with this, there will be some difficult cases in the middle, but this is not that.
Eddings is the heart of what capital sentencing is about. And so, if you allow a reweighing for the first time on an appellate court when there's never been one in the trial court, you are -- you know, you're basically doing everything at that second stage.
And that, I think, is -- is profoundly -- profoundly against what this Court's precedents are. He's right to say Jimenez doesn't directly control this case.
That's not our argument.
Our argument is Jimenez states a truism, that when a case is final, as it was in 1996 when the Court ruled, it can be reopened by voluntary action by the state. And, here, that action happened.
The state reopened and set the clock back to 1996, and they -- you see when you look at and compare side-by-side the 2016 -- 2018 opinion to the -- to the 1996 one, there's actually more extensive analysis.
It's the opposite of harmless error review and the stuff he was talking about in -- in his remarks. If there are any questions. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-935, Monasky versus Taglieri. Mr. Tayrani. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction is designed to protect children who have a country of habitual residence from the harmful effects of wrongful removal from that country.
In this case, however, the Convention was applied to separate two-year-old A.M.T. from her mother, the only caregiver A.M.T. had ever known, and to return the child to Italy, a country where A.M.T. had spent only the first eight weeks of her life. The Sixth Circuit's decision upholding A.M.T.'s return to Italy rests on an erroneous definition of habitual residence.
The Sixth Circuit held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent to raise A.M.T. in Italy even if they had no meeting of the minds.
The court never explained how parents can share an intent about where a child will live if there is no actual agreement between them. Tellingly, neither Taglieri nor the United States defends the Sixth Circuit's habitual residence standard.
They instead urge this Court to adopt an amorphous, all relevant circumstances inquiry.
But, in cases involving infants, the foreign jurisdictions on which Taglieri and the United States rely actually apply a different habitual residence standard. That standard focuses on the primary caregiver's connections to the country of removal, a far more appropriate inquiry. Ultimately, however, under any of the competing definitions of habitual residence and standards of review, the outcome of this case is the same.
Eight-week-old A.M.T. was not habitually resident in Italy.
Indeed, the district court's unchallenged finding that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible is virtually dispositive. This Court should put an end to this already four-year-old litigation by entering an order directing A.M.T.'s return to the United States. I'd like to turn first to the definition of habitual residence. The Sixth Circuit applied a shared parental intent standard in name only because it held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent for her to live in Italy even if they had no meeting of the minds or actual agreement -- Mr. Tay -- -- on that issue. -- Tayrani, a -- a problem with your position, I take it your view is this child, taken to the United States at eight weeks old, has no habitual residence? That is our position, Your Honor. And if that's so, then there are many children who would not be covered by the Convention.
The whole idea of the Convention was to stop unilateral decisions to move a child.
And you would be taking out of the Convention's coverage cases of very young children. With respect, I disagree with the proposition that our approach would lead to a large number of children who do not have a country of habitual residence. First of all, we're talking in this case only about infants.
Older children are evaluated under a different standard, and in all likelihood, based on their connections, their acclimatization to the country in which are all facts that weigh in favor of Italy because they're principally the fact that the child has been located in Italy for her whole life before she was removed. And that's not something that was relevant necessarily to intent, but that's clearly a highly important fact that she was there with both parents. And so we don't see any other facts that could be adduced in this record.
The four-day trial was quite comprehensive.
We don't see any other facts that could be relevant that would require or even permit a different determination on -- on the habitual residency determination, which is why we think a remand isn't necessary. When you and, to the extent you know it, the SG, talk about totality of the circumstances, for older children, does that mean rejecting the view of most of the circuit courts that the key thing is acclimatization? No, I think acclimatization, as children get older, can be highly relevant.
And the -- the -- the courts that have adopted this test, the foreign courts have said that. I think the problem -- Well, but I think most courts have done more than just say that's highly relevant.
Most courts have said that's the question that we're trying to answer. And -- and that provides a kind of anchoring mechanism for courts, right? Okay, now I understand what the question is.
It's a kind of embeddedness in a particular country's life. So, you know -- but, if it's just like one thing that gets thrown in along with everything else, that seems sort of different to me. I -- I think the problem is there's no bright line between when you might think the young child standard applies and when you might think acclimatization becomes relevant.
There probably are crossing lines at one point.
It's really about the young child and -- and is he or she with her parents.
And then, at some point later, when the kids are 15 years old, it may be much more about them than about parental intent. I think most courts have been reluctant to say the parents' intent becomes irrelevant.
I think they -- the courts generally say acclimatization becomes much more relevant. So I wish I could help you with saying that -- that there's -- Isn't that what the European -- -- a dividing line there. -- isn't that what the European court said with respect to infants? It didn't say that you put parental intent or agreement as being the most important.
It used the word just an important factor I think was -- I think that's -- -- was their language. -- that's exactly right, Your Honor. So how do I discern that the mother's intent was to stay in Italy or that the child had acclimated to Italy or integrated into Italy when the child was being -- during those eight weeks, she was moved from one spot to another.
She didn't live consistently with the father.
There were separate -- Well, she moved between two places. Between two places, but the father wasn't in the first place.
Then the mother went for a couple of weeks with the father and then brought her back into the -- the shelter. The mother, I think, had some fairly potent evidence that she was making plans to leave Italy.
Everything about the entire situation surrounding this child was simply up in the air. Well, I think those -- sorry. So why couldn't a court reasonably conclude that no settled place -- Well -- -- no ordinary place had yet been formed for this child? That's a possibility we haven't talked about. But I have to presume that if we tell a court that it's the totality of the circumstances, that is, in fact, one of the options it has. I -- I think it is.
In this case, I think the -- the portions of the district court's opinion that I read on page 94a and 98a preclude that in this case because the district court rejected those -- that as the mother's intent. I -- I -- I think for the reasons that we've been talking about -- and I'd also say the movement from place to place is something that lower courts have rejected, if it's within one country, because the idea here is to find the country of habitual residence. And if those movements, the Second Circuit said, speaking through Judge Cabranes, if -- if those movements are within the country, they don't -- they don't really count with them -- when they're within two places. I -- I -- I wanted to mention the -- Justice Breyer raised a question about Italy and what the proceedings might be there.
There is a -- a proceeding in Italy, a custody proceeding, that a petitioner actually this past October has filed a custody petition. She filed some prior petitions.
They were rejected on jurisdictional grounds.
As I understand it, this petition is in the right Italian court and raises the custody question. But what about the -- the -- this ex parte declaration depriving her of her parental rights? That's still standing. I think that's one of the issues that will be adjudicated in this Italian proceeding.
And as -- as -- as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the current status is that the -- the legal custody of the child is with the Italian authorities. The father has generally physical custody.
The mother has visitation rights. There are periodic reports being filed by the Italian social services authority about what's going on.
So the Italian authorities are pretty seized of -- of -- of this matter. So just to -- to return to the -- the question of the -- of the remand, I think our view is, for the reasons I was discussing, that the district court's findings really deal with the intent issue, his -- his factual findings, let -- putting aside his ultimate determination on habitual residence. All of the other facts that could possibly be relevant under the Judge Boggs standard, framed as a -- a -- a -- a factual presumption, we think weigh in favor of Italy as the place of habitual residence. And we agree that -- that it would be great to cut off these proceedings.
Tomorrow will be the three-year anniversary of A.M.T. being returned to Italy, and it would certainly be good for the -- this uncertainty to be lifted so that she could then -- the Italian authorities could proceed with the custody determination without this issue being raised. And -- and I do think, as several members of the Court said, that there would be significant problems with the issuance of a re-return order, both in terms of a U.S. court's ability to issue such an order, given the equitable considerations, and also the extent to which such an order would be accepted by the Italian authorities. Unless the Court has any further questions, thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Tayrani. Thank you.
Three points, Your Honor. With respect to the standard applied by foreign courts to cases involving infants, I would point the Court to paragraph 55 in the European Union Court of Justice's decision in the Mercredi case. The Court there stated that an infant necessarily shares the social and family environment of the circle of people on whom he or she is dependent.
Consequently, where the infant is, in fact, looked after by her mother, it is necessary to assess the mother's integration in her family and social environment. That is the standard that Lady Hale adopts in the A versus A case at paragraph 54, sub (6): Applying that standard in this case leads to one clear inextricable conclusion, that Monasky was not integrated into a family and social environment in Italy and that, therefore, A.M.T. did not have a habitual residence in Italy. This Court need look no further than the parties' stipulation at JA 28 and JA 29 that, as early as August of 2014, Monasky was already laying the groundwork for her return to the United States by looking for U.S. healthcare and child care options, U.S. employment, and U.S. divorce lawyers. This Court need look no further than JA 200 and JA 217, which are emails between the parties sent in the critical days preceding and following A.M.T.'s birth, where Monasky reiterated her intent to return to the United States and to divorce Taglieri. And this Court need look no further than Pet. App. 94a, where the district court found that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible. That's precisely what she did.
The day A.M.T.'s U.S. passport arrived, when A.M.T. was eight weeks old, Monasky fled the dangerous situation in which she found herself and returned to the United States. This Court can and should make that determination and it should order A.M.T.'s return to the United States for a full and fair child custody hearing, which is the only venue in that -- in which that hearing can take place. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1432, Nasrallah versus Barr. Mr. Hughes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the jurisdiction-stripping provision in (2)(C), it expressly defined the key term ""order of removal."" It is an order that finds an individual deportable or orders deportation. A CAT order does neither, and the government does not disagree.
CAT relief is temporary, applicable only to the country where an individual is likely to be tortured or killed.
If CAT relief is granted, the removal order remains enforceable.
As the government says, ""a grant of withholding or deferral leaves the final order of removal undisturbed."" When Congress enacted (2)(C), it also stripped jurisdiction of expedited removal orders.
This is Section (2)(A), reprinted in the government's brief at page 4a.
It bars judicial review of ""any individual determination or any other cause or claim arising from or relating to the implementation or operation"" of an expedited order of removal.
That broader language expanded jurisdiction stripping beyond the removal order itself, but Congress did not use that broader language in (2)(C). If none of this carries the day and if some ambiguity remains, the presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative agency action would do the work.
Judicial review of administrative agencies is an essential part of the Constitution's separation of powers. Congress designed CAT relief to be available when all else is stripped away. Congress knowingly rendered those with criminal convictions eligible for protection from likely torture or death.
By its plain terms, 2(C) does not bar review of a CAT claim.
Ultimately, the CAT claim does not qualify as an order of removal. Again, the government doesn't contend that it fits within the clear statutory definition.
And I don't think it can, because the CAT relief comes temporally after in the proceedings the order of removal is entered. Do you agree -- That's both -- -- do you agree that, assuming that review of the -- of BIA fact-finding, assuming that it's available, wouldn't that review be highly deferential to the BIA? Yes, Your Honor, it would be for the substantial evidence review that would govern in circumstances when (2)(C) does not apply.
So I agree there is deference to the BIA.
But deference doesn't mean there's no judicial review.
It just is the appropriate deferential standard that would apply across the board of judicial review of administrative agency fact-finding. Do you agree that your CAT claim is covered by the so-called zipper clause? So I think there is an open question, Your Honor, if the zipper clause extends here.
Footnote 2 of Jennings suggests that the zipper clause might not apply in context of asylum, and I think this would -- would be similarly qualified.
But I'm willing to assume for a moment, even if the Court were to think that the zipper clause of (b)(9) applies to the CAT claim, I don't think that's any problem for our position. I think the zipper clause can be thought of doing two potentially different things.
The first thing it can do is, consistent you also agree it doesn't do. So you're saying, well, even though there's this explicit definition here, we should look back to a bunch of cases that were decided before the statutory definition came about, that were decided before (a)(4) and (a)(5) came about, that even when they were decided the Court said that the language wasn't clear, and the only reason that they were deciding the case that way was because they had a policy concern about bifurcation, which doesn't exist anymore. So why would we look to those cases rather than the explicit statutory definition? Well, Justice Kagan, we do think the history that preceded this statute should inform the Court's understanding of it.
We are also pointing the Court towards the explicit text of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, which makes clear that Congress anticipated that CAT claims would be reviewable as part of a final order of review, which is consistent with our reading of the statutory definition but not Petitioner's unduly narrow understanding of that term. Now, before my time expires, Justice Alito, I would like to address the question that you posed to Petitioner's counsel earlier.
We -- we do think that Petitioner has waived any argument that the court of appeals erred in applying the criminal alien jurisdictional bar. In this particular case, Petitioner did not seek rehearing en banc on that issue.
Petitioner did not seek this Court's review on that issue. Now, having said that, we think the Eleventh Circuit's rule is incorrect and ordinarily a finding of removability under Section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) is not itself sufficient to trigger the criminal alien jurisdiction bar. But that's of no moment for the purposes of deciding this particular case.
We think the Court can decide the case on the premise, which Petitioner did not dispute, that -- Back -- back to the main argument, the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have adopted Petitioner's view of this statute, obviously, big circuits with lots of cases. Are you aware of significant problems in how they've been applying substantial evidence review to factual components of CAT claims or other problems that that's generated? Your Honor, the -- the -- the standard has made a difference in some cases in the Ninth Circuit.
There are -- there are decisions in the Ninth Circuit in which, in our view, criminal aliens were able to reverse the agency's fact-finding on appeal and circumstances in which the Congress -- the -- the statute should have foreclosed that kind of proceeding on appeal. We also -- Which way does that cut? If I may simply -- I mean, doesn't that suggest there, at least the courts thought there were mistakes being made in the administrative process in those cases? Well, it's true that there are some decisions in which panels of the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the agency fact-finding. But I will just add, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the rule that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits have applied is not the rule that Petitioner has advocated here and, in fact, he has abandoned the reasoning of those courts. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Hughes. Thank you. I'd like to first begin with a point that the government made about the notion that the removal order is limited to removal only to the country specified in the removal order. Respectfully, that's just legally wrong.
The regulation is 8 CFR 1240.12, subprovision (d).
It does state that an immigration judge needs to identify one or more countries to which removal is to occur. But the second sentence in that provision, and I quote, ""In the event that the Department of Homeland Security is unable to remove the alien to the specified or alternative country or countries, the order of the immigration judge does not limit the authority of the Department of Homeland Security to remove the alien to any other country, as permitted by Section 241(b) of the Act."" So there is no need to amend or alter the final order of removal in the event of CAT relief to -- to Lebanon, even though that Lebanon specified in that order the individual -- that DHS without further administrative action can remove the individual to any country that's specified in Section 241. The second point, the government's claims that were -- This is just curiosity to me.
Can the government change a port of deportation? Assuming a prisoner comes and says, my mother is in this other country, I'd rather go there? I -- I think there -- Do they have to go back to the judge to get permission to do that? No, Your Honor.
This regulation allows the individual to be sent to other countries in -- in the section, this is in 1231 or Section 241.
One of the countries that -- can be a country that the individual agrees to go to, I believe, and that is willing to accept that person.
So, if those things match up and they work with the government, that -- that can be. But it's all laid out, as Justice Alito mentioned a few moments ago, about the different countries and orders that are permitted by the statute.
Those are all swept within the order of removal, even if it says Lebanon on it by the regulation. The second point, the government suggests that we're wrong about the legislative -- or about the history of the REAL ID Act.
I think we're clear on the text of what (a)(4) does and explain jurisdiction and the clear purpose. But, again, the -- the argument about the history, I think, is a bit misplaced because, if the only piece of legislative history that describes (a)(4) is in the conference report, and the conference report says that its purpose was to ""allow aliens in Section 240 removal proceedings to seek review in -- in court,"" so the only snippet of legislative history that we have on (a)(4) says that the purpose of it is to create judicial review. The government's contention that we're just mistaken about the history there, I think, is a misplaced argument.
This is exactly what Congress sought to do. Now the next point, I think this is a pretty straightforward question of textual interpretation.
This -- in AEDPA, Congress stripped courts from doing one specific act. That's the act of reviewing final orders of removal. For all of the reasons we've described, Mr. Nasrallah does not ask the Court here to review the final order of removal.
He asks the Court to review something very different.
That's the CAT claim. We've described how (a)(4) and the regulations and the definition all confirm that this is not the order of deportation. The government's attempt here is to effectively back-door in through all of these various different provisions a broader effect of (2)(C) than what Congress actually wrote in (2)(C). But (2)(C) was pretty straightforward on its face because I remind the Court in A-47, that definition, order of deportation, was enacted by Congress for the specific purpose of defining the scope of (2)(C). Congress said in Section 440(a) of -- of AEDPA, we are going to strip jurisdiction for criminal aliens with certain convictions.
And in -- in 440(b), we're going to define the scope of that.
This is just simply outside the scope of the jurisdiction-stripping statute that Congress enacted as it defined when it engaged in enacting that -- that provision. But, next, if there's any doubt about this, if ultimately the Court thinks that these other provisions create multiple plausible interpretations of the statutory text, this is where the Court's strong presumption in favor of judicial review of agency action would do the work. Again, it's the government's burden not to show that there are multiple plausible interpretations but that its interpretation is the only correct one.
We think the text is unambiguous in our favor. But, if the Court disagrees with us, at the very least, there are multiple plausible interpretations, and, there, the presumption in favor of judicial review would do the work. And -- and then, finally, Congress purposefully chose to make CAT claims absolute. Congress -- this was a broad recognition to the horrors of torture. When there is an error in the administrative process, as the government just identified below, what that means is a court has found that the administrative agency made an error in finding that torture was not more likely than not. When there -- a CAT relief -- when CAT relief is granted, that means that there is a finding that it is more than 50 percent likely that the individual is going to be tortured or extrajudicially killed upon removal to that country. The United States has made a firm commitment that our deportation system is not going to be used to send an individual to a place where they are more likely than not to be subject to torture or deportation -- or torture or death. It is completely sensible that Congress did not extend (2)(C) to jurisdiction stripping in these circumstances.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1268, Opati versus the Republic -- Republic of Sudan. Mr. McGill. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Sudan provided Al Qaeda with a safe haven and vital material support enabling it to carry out the embassy bombings, killing 224 people and wounding thousands more.
In retaliation, President Clinton sent 13 cruise missiles into Khartoum.
But to impose punitive damages, Sudan argues, somehow would violate principles of fundamental fairness embodied in the Landgraf presumption. If fairness is the issue here, then Sudan surely should lose.
The State Department had designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993, but Sudan continued to shelter Osama Bin Laden even as he issued fatwahs calling for attacks on U.S. interests. In 1996 Congress enacted the Flatow amendment which, which explicitly provided for punitive damages for acts of state-sponsored terrorism. But still Sudan continued to harbor Al Qaeda. Sudan had ample opportunity to conform its primary conduct to U.S. law.
It just chose not to.
And that's not particularly surprising, because Sudan is a foreign government and foreign governments generally are not guided in their policymaking by changes to U.S. law.
The central rationale underpinning the Landgraf presumption simply is not applicable where the legislation is directed at foreign governments. But, ultimately, this Court need not decide here whether Landgraf or Altmann applies, because the first step in the analysis is to determine whether Congress has clearly defined the statute's temporal reach. And here it is abundantly clear that Congress intended punitive damages be available in two carefully defined categories of cases involving past acts of terrorism. In the subsection entitled, ""Application to Pending Cases,"" Congress set forth two categories of cases, prior actions and related actions, each of which were unmistakably directed at past acts of terrorism. Then the amendments say, in Section 1083(c)(1), ""The amendments made by this section shall apply to any claim arising under Section 1605A."" Congress had said prior -- prior actions and related actions could file under this new 1605A, and now Congress is saying the amendments made by this section shall apply to any of those claims. And Sudan concedes, at page 43 of its brief, that that meant all of the amendments in Section 1983 apply to a claim arising under Section 1605A. That language, ""shall apply to"" -- ""to any claim,"" is virtually identical to the language in footnote 8 of Landgraf, ""shall apply to all proceedings,"" that -- that Landgraf described as an unambiguous directive and that the Court later in Martin versus Hadix described as unambiguously addressing the temporal reach of the statute. In a case involving private -- a private defendant, rather than a sovereign nation, are there constitutional limits on Congress's ability to make punitive damages retroactive? Yes, I think under this Court's decision at least in BMW versus Gore, the Due Process Clause imports some idea of fair notice that would be applicable to persons, but foreign states are not persons within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, mean, you would say, look, if we had filed this three years later, the punitive damages part wouldn't apply because this retroactive -- the ""as if"" thing doesn't apply. And so it can't be clear.
It can't be clear to a preceding one when, although they refer to ""as if,"" it doesn't make sense to apply retroactivity to the older cases and not to the newer cases. And that itself creates an ambiguity. Right.
Saying ""as if"" isn't enough.
Saying -- Well, that's a pretty -- I mean, you have to say something like that. And, boy, we're in outer space, I think, by the -- we're -- Landgraf tells us the -- the -- the notion of retroactive imposition of -- Yeah. -- punitive damages is such a draconian step, it -- it is against -- See, I've got that. -- the basic principles going back centuries about fairness. So before we attribute that intention to Congress, we're going to ask Congress to say it pretty damn clearly. So, Mr. Curran -- That's all it says. -- in your state of the world and if I understand it, it's not just punitive action, punitive damages now, it's really any new liability, any new damages. So you're conceiving of a state of the world where a defendant foreign state gets to walk in and say, well, there's this new thing and that wouldn't have been true before, there's this new thing and that wouldn't have been true before, and -- and that's what it will all come down to, right? And -- and, boy, that seems -- that seems awfully complicated and probably not what Congress had in mind, that somebody would say under Pennsylvania law it works like this. Under Wisconsin law it works like this.
And then different people would be treated in different ways, depending on which state they were in. Could that make any sense? Well, the -- first of all, these principles aren't just for foreign sovereigns.
Right? These are for -- this is for litigation writ large. Yeah. Right? And -- and we're not taking a position that, oh, oh, the federal cause of action shouldn't apply retroactivity because of people in Pennsylvania.
Look, we're not -- we're taking a more practical approach to this, that, in general, the -- the federal cause of action adds nothing new.
So it has no retroactive operation under Landgraf, therefore, it applies retroactively. This is what Landgraf says.
So I -- we're not asking for any change of the law. We're asking for equal-handed treatment of Sudan, as -- on the same footing that other litigants would enjoy the presumptions and other -- other statements in Landgraf, but we're not asking for anything new or radical here. This case presents a straightforward application of the Landgraf steps.
Is there -- is there a clear statement by Congress? If not, then we look and see whether there's a retroactive operation.
If there is a retroactive operation, such as with punitive damages, then the presumption kicks in and -- and the -- and the -- and the new provision cannot apply retroactively.
That's it.
We're not asking for anything radical here. There are other arguments we make in -- in our briefs, including on subject matter jurisdiction.
We invite the Court to consider those, including the one -- that that argues that the Helmerich decision of a couple of years ago has not been applied correctly here because the Court here found that -- applied a wrong standard for jurisdictional causation. We also take issue with the idea that -- that this case involves an extrajudicial killing, because that's a specific term of art under international law.
And we raise a series of other jurisdictional arguments that probably would require a remand or further briefing. Are they -- I know one is a limitation, statute of limitation question, which is an affirmative defense, not a jurisdictional issue. Well, that -- that's the issue, Justice Ginsburg.
The issue is whether the limitations defense is jurisdictional and, therefore, cannot be waived by a defaulting foreign sovereign or whether it is an affirmative defense that can be waived. And our position is, given the placement and text of 1605A(b), that it should be interpreted to be jurisdictional so the court of appeals should have addressed it on the merits. Mr. -- Mr. McGill says that if your interpretation of extrajudicial killing is correct, then the terrorism exception doesn't apply to terrorism. Yeah, that -- that's -- that's semantics. Well -- well -- If there's no question that the four predicate acts each constitute types of terrorism, okay, so -- so it's still the terrorism exception. My question for -- my question to Mr. McGill, I guess, is how come Congress rejected the -- the act of terrorism as it was proposed in the early versions of the -- of the terrorism exception? Well, which terrorists would be covered under your -- under your understanding? Only those who are -- are officially on the payroll of the state? No, no, agents and others engaging in the acts.
Well, it depends -- it may depend on the predicate act, right, there are four predicate acts.
Two of them, extrajudicial killing and torture, are acts under international law that can only be committed by state actors. The other ones, aircraft sabotage and hostage taking, under those conventions, anyone, you don't have to be a state actor, but you can be guilty of the violation under international law.
So it depends on -- on the predicate act. And -- and the ATA, right, we've got the antiterrorist act, which does criminalize and provide civil remedies for acts of international terrorism, that excepts foreign states. So when one considers the broad terrorism statutory scheme, one sees that acts of terrorism generally are prohibited and criminalized and provide for civil remedies, but not against a foreign state, but under the four predicate acts that are embedded in the terrorism exception, those are acts that Congress carefully considered with the advice of the State Department and concluded that those acts are all condemned universally by international law. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
Three minutes, Mr. McGill. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Breyer, let's start with what this case is.
If you turn to 28(a) of the government's brief, you will see the provision for related actions.
That's what these cases are. A related action is -- is one which is -- where there is a -- a case that has been timely commenced under the old terrorism exception, 1605(a)(7), and that's the Owens case, filed in 2001, then any other action -- turn the page -- arising out of the same act or incident may be brought under 1605A.
That is us. We -- because we are related to Owens, we arise out of the same act or incident as Owens, we file under 1605A.
What happens then? Under 1605A1 -- I'm -- I'm sorry, under 1083(c)1, the amendments made by this section shall apply to any claim arising under Section 1605A. The amendments of 1083, therefore, apply to our claims.
And at page 43, Sudan concedes that -- and I'm reading now -- ""Section 1083(C)(1) simply provides that all the amendments under Section 1083 apply to a claim arising under Section 1605A."" All the amendments.
That includes punitive damages. But he's saying -- I think he's saying, look at the -- look at the first -- look at 2(b)(a) in the application to pending cases.
And he's saying with respect to any action brought under 1605(a)(7) -- small a -- that's where this retroactivity, that's where the thing applies, and he says his was -- yours isn't. We're not -- we're -- But you come to -- We're not -- -- the related part. -- a prior action.
We're a related action. Arising out -- But 1605A - -- of the same -- -- applies to both. Prior actions is the Acree case.
Prior actions are cases that already had punitive damages judgments that Congress said could be revived. Any judgment in the action ""shall be given effect as if it had been filed under 1605A(c)."" And it was for that reason that the President first vetoed it, and it was in response to the President's veto that Congress gives waiver authority with respect to Iraq. Mr. McGill, the one argument that they make that I -- can we avoid reaching, is a subject matter jurisdiction, whether relatives of victims for their independent state tort actions fall within any of these statutes, because they all require a U.S. nexus. Yes.
So the -- the argument is that claimant in 1085 -- 1605A(a) means legal representative.
That's their argument.
That argument is wrong for several reasons: First, it's contrary to the plain meaning of claimant.
Second, claimant or victim was language added in a technical amendment in 1997, and it was consistent -- may I -- You can get to third, and then -- Consistently -- consistently applied by lower courts for some 12 years.
And Congress legislated against that background, ratified that, and I'd cite the Inclusive Communities Project for that. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-267, Our Lady of Guadalupe School versus Agnes Morrissey-Berru, and the consolidated case. Mr. Rassbach. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If separation of church and state means anything at all, it must mean the government cannot interfere with the church's decisions about who is authorized to teach its religion. In this country, it is emphatically not the province of judges, juries, or government officials to decide who ought to teach Catholic fifth graders that Jesus is the son of God or who ought to teach Jewish preschoolers what it means to say: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one. And at bottom, that is what these cases are about: who controls who teaches the faith to schoolchildren. Under Hosanna-Tabor, the answer is easy.
Churches must choose those who ""teach their faith."" Indeed, that is one of the most important religious functions for any religious community, passing the faith on to the next generation. And since the teachers here were the churches' primary agents for teaching the Catholic faith to fifth graders, teaching them for hours a week, much more than parish priests, they fall within the ministerial exception immunity. Respondents would have the Court ignore all that, substituting a formalistic standard that relies first and foremost on the employees' title to determine whether the ministerial exception applies.
That would wrongly elevate form over function and force judges to decide what titles sound religious enough to qualify, and it would hopelessly entangle church and state.
Unsurprisingly, no court has ever adopted Respondents' title test. If Respondent's arguments give some members of the Court déjà vu all over again, that is because Respondents have recycled many of the arguments the Court unanimously rejected eight years ago in Hosanna-Tabor.
The pretext inquiry, the notice requirement, the idea that freedom of association makes freedom of religion entirely unnecessary all were raised in Hosanna-Tabor and rejected unanimously.
Eight years later, Respondents' arguments are not any more convincing. In short, there's no reason for government to get in the business of teaching religion.
The Ninth Circuit should be reversed. Counsel, you say in your brief that personnel is policy and that teachers, as part of their job, personify church values.
Is that enough to trigger the exception in your case? I -- I think, in -- in this case, I don't think that's something you have to address, and I don't think that it would -- personification -- Well, I don't -- I don't have to address it, but you do because I asked. (Laughter.) Yes, Your Honor.
I -- I think, on -- on the basis of personification alone, I don't -- I don't think that that would necessarily mean -- mean that we would win the case. I think that the -- the right answer is that it's something -- they -- what functions were they performing, and those functions were to teach the faith for hours on end over the course of a week. Does your argument, both they sincerely believe that employees perform important religious functions.
But that just shows that that can't possibly be the right test here. And I think your earlier questions pointed that out.
And so you're exactly right, that courts should stay out of that business. And so what's the solution then? Well, we think what the solution is, is that these courts should look to the objective factors that are outlined in Hosanna-Tabor, the things that are more legalistic and the things that are more ex ante decisions of the church as to who to designate as its spiritual leaders. And then ask that legal question about -- about function and duties through the lens of the Establishment Clause as a matter of first principles.
We think it's telling, Justice Gorsuch, that for centuries of history that is discussed on the other side of this case, there's not one single example of a person who was not a titled member of the clergy receiving the kind of protection they're being requested today. We think if there were this deeply rooted First Amendment rule that they're describing, there would be thousands of cases, millions of cases because they're talking about expanding who is covered by the ministerial exception from primarily people that have objective indicia of ministerial status to making them truly the minority among a sea of employees, just -- just teachers alone, who have important religious duties but have never been thought to fall within the ministerial exception. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good afternoon and welcome, Mr. Fisher.
I want to start with a question that comes from the amicus brief of the Milwaukee Jewish Day School.
They say that the Ninth Circuit's approach, the more formalistic or objective approach, means that, in their words, ""Jewish schools have fared markedly worse"" under that test, under the Ninth Circuit's formulation at least of that test. I want to get your reaction to that and how we can prevent that. Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I haven't seen any empirical proof for that statement, and we don't see why that would be the case. Remember, the Ninth Circuit itself harmonized its decision with the Seventh Circuit's Grussgott case, which dealt with the Jewish Day School and said that even there, the teacher had special training to be teaching in that school and that teacher may well be different. And -- and, Justice Kavanaugh, if I would just return you -- I know I've said this before, but the cases we cite in red brief -- in our red brief in Footnote 1 deal with schools of the Christian faith, of Jewish faith, and I think even some other faiths. And across the board, we see a consistent treatment of lay teachers like our clients here being outside of the ministerial exception.
So -- Okay.
The next question is: In terms of formulating the legal test, as the Court said in Hosanna-Tabor, it's enough in the first case just to list the factors.
We may have to refine that in this case. If we refined it by adopting Justice Alito's concurrence, what would be the problems, if any, with that from your perspective? Well, I -- I think the -- we agree with much of the concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh.
We agree that title -- certainly, the -- certainly, the moniker minister but that titles more generally shouldn't be determinative. And we -- and we agree that function is important.
And we further agree, as I was just saying, that what the Court ought to do, particularly if it wants to be careful in this highly sensitive area, is follow the vast experience of the lower courts. Now where I depart from the concurrence -- and I -- and I -- and I just -- this is just my own difficulty understanding it, is that concurrence leaves out all of the cases that we cite in Footnote 1 of our -- of our brief.
So the concurrence on the one hand says we're saying to be consistent with past law but then suggests -- I think you're right, Justice Kavanaugh, has some suggestions that perhaps -- perhaps a broader ministerial exception for teachers would be appropriate. Okay. And I think the way that we would tell the Court -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to get another question or two in. You mentioned earlier a religious teacher who just picks up -- a religion teacher who just picks up the handbook and you referred to someone like that having no training. And I -- I guess I would question the training point.
There's no way to do this empirically, but my guess is a lot of religion teachers would say their life is their training. Well, Justice Kavanaugh -- How would you respond to that? Well, I -- I -- I think -- I think I'd respond to that by returning to one of Mr. Rassbach's own answers when he was asked is it enough to be a model or a witness. I think he said no. And so I think there's something more than being a model of the faith or using your own personal experience because I don't see how you would distinguish the teachers in this case if that were the -- a proper touchstone from the hundreds of thousands or millions of other employees of religious institutions who are told in their handbooks, in their contracts, by their supervisors to carry out themselves during work hours and their lives according to the faith. Thank you very much, Mr. Fisher. Thank you, Mr. Fisher.
You have a minute or so to wrap up if you'd like. Thank you.
Did I hear somebody else wanted to ask a question? Okay. Thank -- thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. With no other questions, I'll just simply return the Court to what I think is important to bear in mind as the overall question in this case, which is when is categorical immunity required on the one hand and when is it not enough to say you're -- you're entitled as a statutory matter to choose people of your own religion to work for you and you're also entitled as a statutory matter and as a free exercise matter to hire and fire and set their terms and conditions of employment according to your religious values. And we think the lay teachers here fall on the latter side of the line.
It is enough to give the schools in this case the ability to hire, fire, discipline, and otherwise set the terms and conditions of employment according to their religious values. And it is too much and it would blow a hole in our nation's civil rights laws and our employment laws in general to say that categorical immunity applies and so schools can pay people different amounts, use race, sex, other private characteristics even when they have nothing to do with the religion and the religious values at stake. So we ask the Court to affirm. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rassbach, two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A -- a few points.
The first is that the proof is in the pudding, and we have the pudding here.
The ministerial exception has been working well for decades and has been using the functional consensus both before and after Hosanna-Tabor. And you look at pages 8 through 9 of the yellow brief, we explain that there are other cases where lay teachers and -- and have been decided under -- under the functional test. So there -- I would advert to the fact that the -- the federal government said there are three buckets, pastors, musicians, teachers. Teacher cases are common and they get decided under the functional consensus all the time. And I would say post-Hosanna-Tabor, there's been a real crystallization among the lower courts around the Alito concurrence in Hosanna-Tabor. By contrast, the Respondents' test has never been used.
And their claims of things like, you know, nurses, lots and lots of nurse cases -- there haven't been nurse cases in four decades.
There's not going to start being a lot now. There's no need to decide the co-religionist issue in this case.
In this case, they -- they are -- they were co-religionists and both schools wanted their teachers to be Catholic, just like in Hosanna-Tabor, when there were non- -- not people from that same religion that were used -- there were sometimes gap fillers employed. And, finally, this is a heartland case.
These teachers are the primary teacher of the faith.
They are the stewards of the faith. They are the leaders of their classroom.
They -- they -- the function of teaching the next generation is central, as Mr. Fisher just conceded.
These -- these are the people who will teach the faith to the next generation.
If -- if they don't do it, no one else will. The decisions below would replace Hosanna-Tabor's well-designed framework for deciding delicate church/state questions with a constitutional thicket.
They should be reversed. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-801, Peter versus NantKwest. Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An unsuccessful patent applicant may seek judicial review through either a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141 or a district court suit under Section 145. Section 145 states that an applicant who files suit under that provision must pay all the expenses of the proceeding. The question presented here is whether those expenses include money that the PTO spends to employ lawyers and paralegals who assist with the agency's defense of the suit. For three principal reasons, the answer to that question is yes.
First, the term ""expenses"" unambiguously encompasses costs -- encompasses money paid to employees or other personnel to accomplish an -- a particular task. And unlike the term ""costs,"" which has a similarly broad common meaning, this Court has not construed the term ""expenses"" as a legal term of art with a more limited scope. Second, requiring patent applicants who file suit under Section 145 to pay personnel expenses of the PTO is consistent with the overall statutory scheme.
Congress has directed the PTO to charge fees that are sufficient to cover its aggregate operating costs, including personnel expenses. And the PTO has developed fee schedules that, in a rough and ready way, require applicants who cause the agency to incur greater expenses to -- to pay more in the way of fees.
And Section 145 applicants put the PTO to a particular expenses, and it's therefore consistent with the logic of the statute to require them to pay more. And, third, it's especially appropriate to require Section 145 plaintiffs to pay the PTO's personnel expenses because Section 141 is available as an alternative means of obtaining judicial review.
Section 141 is not a cut-rate or a substandard mode of judicial review.
It's ordinary, on the record, APA-style judicial review.
And it contains no requirement that the -- the applicant who chooses that course must pay the PTO's personnel expenses. And so -- Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, is there any other federal statute that provides for attorneys' fees on the basis of the word ""expenses"" alone? As you know, there are expenses and attorneys' fees, expenses including attorneys' fees.
But what other statute provides for attorneys' fees simply on the basis of the word ""expenses""? We're not aware of any, unless you include the trademark analogue to this provision.
And, presumably, the government's position on those two statutes will rise or fall together. We're -- we're frankly not aware of any other federal statute that uses the term ""expenses"" standing alone; that is, as -- as Your Honor's question suggests, when Congress has provided for shifting of expenses, it typically makes clear that it intends to provide for payment of attorneys' fees in -- in the course of doing that.
But sometimes it says expenses including attorneys' fees, sometimes expenses and attorneys' fees. How -- how about to the losing party? Are there other statutes that provide for fees, attorneys' fees, as 145. The prior 145 has the exact same language that the current 145 has, but it added a clause where the entire statute at the time was ""all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant, whether he shall prevail or not, prevail or otherwise,"" or words to that effect. So Congress, in adding this attorneys' fees provision for Section 285, where they use the word ""attorneys' fees,"" took out that last clause.
So it wasn't just carelessness, we're not worrying about the rest of the Patent Act. They were focused and focused in particular on 145. I want to point out also that the government argued that there is no other statute that would be affected.
We respectfully disagree.
The word ""expenses"" standing alone without a reference to attorneys' fees in an open-ended fashion appears elsewhere. Let me give you an example: 19 U.S.C. 1608.
19 U.S.C. 1608.
It relates to customs forfeitures.
So a party saying, Customs Department, you shouldn't have caused my property to be forfeited, I want it back, must pay ""all"" -- the word ""all"" appears -- ""all the costs and expenses."" It's pretty closely analogous to this statute here.
No party, no one, not the government or anyone else, not an academician has ever raised the question about ""all the expenses"" in that statute includes attorneys' fees. Here's another example: This is 19 U.S.C. 6337.
The IRS can levy on a taxpayer's property, if the taxes weren't paid.
So the private taxpayer says: I want my property back. And the statute provides: Taxpayer, you get your property back if you pay the expenses and the unpaid tax. I suppose a difference there is -- and maybe there is -- but I gather in those situations there weren't alternative proceedings that you could go through. I do not know before the statutes whether there were or were not alternative proceedings.
My main point is in those two examples, one that refers to all expenses and the other that refers to expenses, they are open-ended. Yeah, I -- I -- I don't want to preempt him, but I suspect Mr. Stewart will say don't worry about those, because those are different.
Here, you know, the -- the applicant has two different routes, and if he wants to take the route that imposes more -- excuse me -- more costs on the government, then he should be expected to pay for it. Well, that is their argument.
But that is rewriting the statute that Congress actually enacted in 1839.
Because it may sound sensible to the government today. In 1839 -- you've gone to a lot of work here, but in 1839, say 1840 to 1865, they did have a fund where the patentees paid all the expenses, et cetera.
And then they had this too for the 145 equivalent to 145. During that period of time, that period of time, did the government ever try to collect attorneys' fees as part of the expenses? No. No.
Okay. I thank the Court very much. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have six minutes remaining. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, there were -- there were various questions concerning the -- the legal significance of the PTO's, and formerly the Patent Office's, failure to take this position over an extended period of time. And there is no question this is an atmospherically unhelpful point for us, but I -- I -- (Laughter.) I -- I don't -- I don't think that it fits in any established doctrinal category, that -- that is, there are cases in which the Court has said when you have a body of court of appeals precedent that adopts a particular interpretation of a particular term, and then Congress reenacts the provision without changing that term, then Congress can be supposed to have acquiesced in or ratified the -- the prior judicial interpretation. We don't have anything like that here. We don't have a body of lower court case law saying that the term expenses doesn't include personnel expenses. You do have that interpretation through action by the agency itself over the period of 190 years or something. I mean, you could -- you could say at the most that a -- a view that these expenses were not recoverable is implicit in what the PTO has done or not done.
Even with respect to the PTO, it's not as though the agency ever promulgated a regulation or issued some similarly formal statement to the effect that we think expenses means the following things and it doesn't include -- But we do have a doctrine, the American Rule, that says that unless a clear statement of attorneys' fees is encompassed, we won't impose them.
So for 170 years the PTO didn't think of expenses, including attorneys' fees.
Very consistent with the American Rule. Okay.
The -- the two things I would say are it -- it might be that part of the PTO's motivation, we don't know, but it's a reasonable speculation, is that the PTO didn't seek these expenses in part because it wondered whether the term was sufficiently clear to overcome the American Rule.
But on close examination, we think that it is. That is, NantKwest has offered various examples of things that it would be covered -- thinks that it would be covered, things that it thinks wouldn't be covered, but it hasn't propounded a test.
It hasn't pointed the Court to a dictionary that would include some things and not the others. The other -- What about your -- I know this is slightly frivolous, but, I mean, we say we finally figured out what Justinian meant by this particular thing, a thousand years ago. Do you see the -- I -- I -- I see the point, but, you know, the Court -- the Court -- Can you share it with the rest of us? (Laughter.) The -- the -- the Court has said in cases like United States versus Fausto that the implications of existing statutory provisions may be clarified by newly-enacted provisions, and the PTO has examined this matter afresh in light of the totality of the statutory scheme. And the last thing I would want to say, and it's in -- in part a continuation of the point I was making earlier about the Section 145 suit being, in a very meaningful sense, in a legal sense, a continuation of the examination process. Up to this point, Congress has directed the PTO to ensure that its aggregate intake equals its aggregate expenses.
It hasn't directed the PTO to fine-tune the process to ensure that each patent applicant pays his or her fair share. But suppose it did.
Suppose Congress said each applicant shall pay all the expenses of the application and examination process.
If -- if the argument was made, that shouldn't include a pro rata share of the salary of the PTO examiner who worked on the case.
The Court would say that's crazy.
How could -- how could the PTO possibly effectuate its congressional mandate to collect aggregate expenses in a way that equals costs if it didn't -- if it didn't collect the single greatest expense that it incurs when a PTO examiner does his or her work? And, similarly, an appeal to the Board.
If each patent applicant was required to pay all the expenses of the Board proceeding, of course that would include an increment of money that was attributable to the time spent on the case by the Board judges, even though those judges are lawyers. No one would think that the American Rule required some clearer statement than that, that Congress intended the person who invoked that process to pay the extra expenses that the PTO incurs by virtue of that process. Similarly, the examiners on the patent side are typically not lawyers.
Trademark examiners are lawyers.
And the work that they do in examination is, therefore, lawyers' work. But nobody imagines that the American Rule has anything to do with the PTO's ability to make sure that people who invoke the examination services pay their fair share of the PTO's overall expenses. I think this goes back to a question that you got at the very beginning.
But setting attorneys' fees aside, could you tell us, Mr. Stewart, exactly what expenses you charge for and exactly what expenses you don't? I mean, sometimes we have charged for travel expenses.
We didn't in this case.
I don't believe we charged for printing costs, although I think we could have. With respect to personnel expenses specifically, we would charge for the lawyers. We would charge for the legal -- for the paralegals. In this case we had an outside expert who was -- was kind of paid money out of the agency's funds, and we did charge for that. There are other circumstances in which, rather than retain an outside expert, we get expertise from within the agency. So it could be the patent examiner who worked on the case or it could be somebody else, and we would charge a pro rata share of that person's time. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-107, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes versus the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Cole. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Aimee Stephens is a transgender woman. She was a valued employee of Harris Funeral Homes for six years, until she told her boss that she was going to live and identify as a woman. When Harris Homes responded by firing her, it discriminated against her because of her sex for three reasons: First, in firing her for failing to conform to its owner's explicitly stated stereotypes about how men and women should behave, it discriminated against her in the same way that Price Waterhouse discriminated against Ann Hopkins for failing to walk and talk more femininely.
It can't be that Ann Hopkins would lose her case on the same facts were she transgender. Second, Harris Homes fired her for identifying as a woman only because she was assigned a male sex at birth.
In doing so, it fired her for contravening a sex-specific expectation that applies only to people assigned male sex at birth; namely, that they live and identify as a man for their entire lives.
That is disparate treatment on the basis of sex. Third, Harris Homes fired her for, in its owner's words, changing her sex.
That's discrimination in the same way that firing someone for changing their religion would be religious discrimination. That Harris Homes would fire both transgender men for being insufficiently feminine and transgender women for being insufficiently masculine is, as the government concedes, two acts of sex discrimination, not a defense. None of these arguments ask this Court to redefine or, in Judge Posner's words, update sex.
They assume, arguendo, that sex means at a minimum sex assigned at birth based on visible anatomy or biological sex. I understand -- I understand that as the argument, and I -- I believe it's the same as in -- in the prior case.
But it -- does that argument hold up when you get to specific work requirements? In other words, if the objection of a transgender man transitioning to woman is that he should be allowed to use, he or she, should be allowed to use the women's bathroom, now, how do you analyze that? I understand how you analyze -- Yeah. -- status as it were, maybe that's hiring and firing on the basis -- treating it as just on the basis of sex, but when you get to specific policies, does that hold true? So, first of all, Your Honor, how one -- how you answer this case will not resolve how you answer that case.
Whether you rule against us or for us, the next case will arise in the -- in the following sense: A dress code that distinguishes on the basis of sex obviously is because of sex.
The question, then, is does it impose a discriminatory term and condition? And as this Court said in Burlington Northern, to discriminate is not just to differentiate, but to differentiate in my friends on the other side would have you update it, they're actually undermining the manner in which Congress has traditionally considered updating it. If you look at ENDA, which I think -- ENDA. -- refers to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, for nearly a decade now, when Congress has looked and considered expanding the scope of the liability provisions, it has acknowledged that there are religious liberty issues at stake.
And it wants to be able to take those into account too. If you look at the states, they've often come to very similar compromises where they found peace amongst otherwise very -- Got it. -- groups of very different views. But if you resolve this issue judicially, you are essentially delivering -- and I hate to use these types of terms -- All right. -- but a complete victory to one side of the fight and nothing to the other side -- All right.
I've got that point. -- of the fight, you're upsetting that -- Yeah. -- legislative balance. Look I -- I think that is an argument in your favor. Yeah. Moreover, I think this whole category is the elephant in the room and -- That -- that was actually the -- -- I think it is -- -- third point point I was going to make to Justice Gorsuch. Well, all right, I think it is.
But then on the other side of what you're saying is the following, which is abstract but no more so. In the '60s, we were only ten years away from where people who were real slaves and -- and discriminated against obtained a degree of freedom.
And these statutes were all part of a civil rights movement that was designed to give, include in our society, people who had been truly discriminated against for the worst of reasons. And at that time, this civil rights statute, when it was passed, would have put in the category gay people, transgender people, of people who were suffering terrible discrimination.
And over time, this Court has moved away from that view finding it unconstitutional. And now, doesn't that fact, which is an overwhelming fact to me about the nature of the country under law, argue that that's a change.
That's a change that both explains why they didn't put it in initially and explains why we should, other things being equal, interpret it to include gay people and transgender people now? No, Your Honor, for a couple of reasons, I would argue against that.
And, again, I'm going to put the text to the one side, but, though I do think that that is our strongest argument. I -- I -- I -- I actually find it troubling for courts to take that approach because I actually think it deprives the people of the ability to struggle with these issues democratically. And I think it is very important when we have these kinds of big changes, that we actually convince one another that this is the right thing to do. No one ever -- And when courts -- No one ever thought sexual harassment was encompassed by discrimination on the basis of sex back in '64. It wasn't until a book was written in the middle '70s bringing that out. And now we say, of course, harassing someone, subjecting her to terms and conditions of employment she would not encounter if she were a male, that is sex discrimination but it wasn't recognized -- And -- -- to be such in the beginning. And, Your Honor, I think that that is a straightforward application of Title VII's text. With respect to what I was talking about with Justice Breyer where we were putting the text aside, I think it is important to allow the democratic processes to resolve these issues so we have a stable resolution of the issue and one that takes into account what everybody would agree are legitimate interests on all sides. In Obergefell, this Court made very clear that there were good and decent people who had different views with respect to gay marriage and they should be respected. The legislative process is the process that allows those views to respect -- be respected as well as the very powerful views of my friends on the other side -- May I -- General Francisco -- -- which also should be respected. May -- may I just ask, at what point does a court continue to permit invidious discrimination against groups that, where we have a difference of opinion, we believe the language of the statute is clear. I think Justice Breyer was right that Title VII, the Civil Rights Act, all of our acts were born from the desire to ensure that we treated people equally and not on the basis of invidious reasons. And we can't deny that homosexuals are being fired merely for being who they are and not because of religious reasons, not because they are performing their jobs poorly, not because they can't do whatever is required of a position, but merely because they're a suspect class to some people.
They may have power in some regions, but they're still being beaten, they are still being ostracized from certain things. At what point does a court say, Congress spoke about this, the original Congress who wrote this statute told us what they meant. They used clear words.
And regardless of what others may have thought over time, it's very clear that what's happening fits those words. At what point do we say we have to step in? I guess my answer, Your Honor, would be at the point when Congress actually addresses the issue.
And the main argument that we are making and have been making from beginning to end is that Congress has not resolved this issue because sex/gender identity, sex/sexual orientation -- General, these are some -- -- are different traits. -- some thoughtful responses that you have given to this set of questions. But in responding to Justice Breyer, you said, if we thought that there was a clear application of the statute.
So I would just ask you, if you thought that this was a clear application of the statute in the same way that sexual harassment was a clear application of the statute, even though nobody recognized it at the time, if you thought that this was a clear application of the statute, would we have to come out against you? Yes, Your Honor, if the statute is unambiguously against me, you have to rule against me.
I actually think that the statute is unambiguously in my favor for the reasons I was given and the third reason, which is the reason that Justice Breyer alluded to, Justice Scalia's great line about how we don't hide elephants in mouse holes. Everybody here agrees that Congress never thought that by prohibiting discrimination based on sex, they would also be prohibiting discrimination based on two very different traits, sexual orientation and gender identity. My friends would have this Court essentially reach that same result indirectly. I think all of the textual arguments cut in our favor straight away, but to the extent there is any doubt, there is no way to find that elephant in this mouse hole. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Cole. Thank you. Interpreting a statute is not depriving the democratic process.
It is doing what the Court is supposed to do within the democratic process, and of course if the democratic process disagrees with the Court's interpretation of the statute, it can change it. So there's no deprivation of the democratic process here. Secondly, the purpose of Title VII as this Court defined it was to make sex irrelevant to people's ability to succeed at work, to make sex irrelevant to people's ability to succeed at work. When Harris Homes fired Aimee Stephens because it learned about her sex assigned at birth being different from her gender identity, it did not make sex irrelevant to her ability to succeed at work.
It made it determinative. Think about it this way.
If Harris Homes fired a man because he was a man that would be sex discrimination.
If it fired an employee because he was insufficiently masculine, that would clearly be sex discrimination. In this case, Harris Homes fired Aimee Stephens because he thought she is a man who is insufficiently masculine.
That too must be sex discrimination. She's not seeking any special protection.
She is seeking and all transgender people are seeking the same protection that everybody else gets under the law.
This Court 30 years ago said in Price Waterhouse: ""We are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by insisting that they match the stereotypes associated with their group."" We are certainly beyond that day today as well, and what Harris Homes did was to insist that she match the stereotypes associated with her group.
That's impermissible under this Court's precedence, that's impermissible under the literal terms of the statute and this Court should rule for Aimee Stephens. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-5924, Ramos versus Louisiana. Mr. Fisher. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Last term in Timbs against Indiana, this Court reaffirmed the well-settled rule that incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights apply the same way to the states as they apply to the federal government. Taking that rule as the given, the state does not defend Justice Powell's pivotal vote in the Apodaca case.
And, indeed, that reasoning flouted precedent at the time and has since been relegated to nothing more than an isolated relic of an abandoned doctrine. The state's only defense in -- in support of the judgment below is that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity at all; that is, not in state courts or in federal courts. This Court should reject that argument.
As the Court has said many times over many decades, the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict to convict.
In particular, what the Court has said is that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury carries with it the essentials of the common law. And the common law authorities are uniform, explicit, and absolute.
Unanimity is an absolute requirement to trial by jury.
And the reasons that the common law commentators gave for that rule are the -- are -- resonate just as powerfully now as they did then.
In a nutshell, we are not prepared to take away someone's liberty unless a cross-section of the community uniformly agrees that criminal punishment is appropriate. Now, I don't think the state disputes that historical account that I just gave you or even that unanimity is central to the proper functioning of the jury trial right.
Instead, what the state says are two primary things: First, that the drafting history of the Sixth Amendment suggests that the framers meant to dispense with that historical rule, and, second, that that historical requirement of unanimity is no more important than the 12-person rule, which this Court said is not part of the Sixth Amendment, in Williams. So let me turn to those two arguments. Let me start with the drafting history.
And we think for three reasons the state has over-read the drafting history. First, as the Court itself said in cases dealing with provisions like the Second Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause, we do not read into a deletion of language any meaning when there's no contemporary evidence that it was designed to change the meaning of the provision. And that's all the more true here because of the contextual backdrop.
The state talks about the fact that many states at the time had trial by jury provisions in their own constitutions and correctly notes that some of those provisions explicitly required unanimity but some of them didn't. And the rule was the same across all of those states, so the thing that the framers would have taken from the context at the time would have been that it doesn't matter whether you have unanimity in the provision; it requires it either way. Well, convicted and sentenced to life, 10-2 or 11-1, who otherwise would have not been convicted.
So that seems like a serious issue for us to think about in terms of overruling. And the second is that the rule in question here is rooted in a -- in racism, you know, rooted in a desire, apparently, to diminish the voices of black jurors in the late 1890s.
So do either of those two -- and that doesn't go to the Sixth Amendment.
That goes to the stare decisis angle. Do either of those two things -- or I guess I should say why aren't those two things enough to overrule, if you accept the legal premises, which I know you don't, but if you accept those, why aren't those two things enough? Again, unfairness to defendants and rooted in racism. So as -- as to the first question with regard to unfairness to defendants, I just do not see how you can separate this from the six-man jury that -- that was approved of in Williams, which is a six-man jury for all crimes less than capital, and six, granted, unanimous rule but still only six, and Louisiana's rule will -- still requires ten. So I -- I don't think it's fundamentally unfair, nor do I think that this Court in any precedent has ever held that it is. But Williams held that the number, the number of jurors was not at the heart of the jury trial right.
The Court said it was a historical accident.
It resembled certain biblical references like 12 apostles, 12 tribes of Israel.
There was nothing inevitable about the number 12.
But there was about the requirement that, whatever the number is, they all agree. Mr. Chief Justice? You may respond. Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think that it was not an historical accident.
I would disagree with that -- that description. I think that these two things were married together in every description, the number 12 and unanimous in every description, have always -- But, it's hard -- -- been married together. It's hard to say you disagree when Williams described the number 12 as a historical accident.
Did you just say Williams was wrong in that respect? I think that characterization of it was dismissive.
That's all.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Fisher. Thank you.
I'd like to make a couple of quick factual points and then talk about stare decisis and reliance. Justice Breyer, you asked a couple of questions about numbers and facts.
So we say in our reply brief, using one of the state's own filings, that there are 36 cases on direct review right now in Louisiana where this issue has been presented. And then even within those 36 is -- even within that 36 you're going to have arguments about whether it was adequately preserved and all the rest.
And so we think, at least in the direct review level, the numbers are actually quite modest and low. And as the Court has described throughout the -- the last half of the argument, the retroactivity questions can be left for another day and covered by their own reliance doctrines. You also asked about Puerto Rico. In Footnote 10 of our brief, we note that the Court held in Balzac that the right to jury trial does not apply the same way in Puerto Rico as to the states.
And so that would be a question about the Insular Cases.
You're going to be talking about that next week, perhaps. But it's something that this case doesn't -- doesn't necessarily address. So as to stare decisis and reliance, let me make a couple points about the state's framing of its arguments and then talk about, I think, Justice Kagan, your sort of alternative framing of the arguments. As to the state's framing of the arguments, I think it's helpful to remember why we have the stare decisis in the first place. It's about settled expectations in the law. And what we're asking you today to do are to reaffirm two things the Court has said many, many times over the years.
One is the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous verdict. And, second, when an incorporated provision applies to the states, it applies the same way as it does to the federal government. So to write that opinion all you have to do is reaffirm what you said many, many times under the law. It is the state's position that it would create upheaval as to the law.
It would raise questions like the one the Chief Justice asked about whether seven to five is okay. The state not only doesn't answer the question in its brief, it provides no way, no way to answer the question.
And that would just be one of many questions that would arise if you agreed with the state's view. So I think then you are left with the alternative argument, that what about -- what about putting a reliance interest into Apodaca itself? I'm not sure, by the way, that Oregon does that.
I think it's also telling that Oregon is not willing to defend.
I know it doesn't go the other way like the state does but it certainly isn't willing to defend Justice Powell's reasoning in Apodaca. But let's imagine that argument were in front of the Court.
I think there is three reasons why you would still overrule Apodaca. The first is the one that a couple of you mentioned, which is that it's not just -- it's not just the interests of the state that have to be taken into account.
It's the interests of defendants. And before we take away somebody's liberty over 600 years of common law tradition, and Sixth Amendment tradition, is we demand a unanimous verdict, unanimous consent of a cross-section of the community. And that is important, as the social science brief in this case shows, for accuracy, public confidence, and all the rest.
And so those reliance interests, which -- by the way, the state itself is not renouncing unanimous verdicts; it maintains the ability under its law to try anyone going forward for a crime committed before January 1st, 2019, and seek a 10-2 verdict.
And so that could go on for years, and that ought to be taken into account. Secondly, I think incorporation is just different.
I think that's the lesson of the sweep of this Court's cases, is reliance interests are less important when it comes to incorporation because the Bill of Rights themselves are so important.
When the Court says something is a fundamental rule under our way of doing criminal justice, the states have to follow that rule the same way as the federal government. And then the last thing I think that makes this case different than an ordinary stare decisis case is the vote in Apodaca.
It's not just that it was a 4-1-4 vote, but it's just that -- it's that the other eight justices rejected the decisive reasoning in that case. And I think that makes this almost a universe of one. And if I could push it even further, I would say that if you have any doubts, look at Justice Powell's reasoning.
Justice Powell's reasoning in Apodaca itself was based on a refusal to follow precedent.
What he said was I'm agreeing with the past dissenters.
I know you have this rule from Malloy against Hogan from five years ago that requires the same standards to apply in a federal court as they apply -- in state court as they apply in federal court, but I don't want to follow that rule. He didn't even try to distinguish the Court's old holding.
So in a sense Apodaca itself was born of a disregard for stare decisis.
And so if you feel strongly about stare decisis as a value, this case is almost singular in its -- in its -- in the compelling reasons right now to -- to overrule Apodaca. Since you mentioned Balzac, can I ask you a question about that? So let's imagine this case is decided in your favor, and then a -- a defendant who has been convicted by a non-unanimous verdict in Puerto Rico comes here and he says, look, I am a citizen of the United States, and the only reason why I was able to be convicted by a non-unanimous verdict is -- are these old Insular Cases that reflect attitudes of the day in the -- in the end of the -- after the -- the aftermath of the Spanish American War, and just as you brushed aside Apodaca, you should brush aside the Insular Cases. I think I would -- I would say that would be different for all the reasons I just outlined.
The Insular Cases were majority decisions from the Court.
They were -- they were based on a view that has not been disregarded or left behind in the Court's jurisprudence. There may be arguments parties can make under ordinary stare decisis principles, but the last point I would leave you with is this is not an ordinary stare decisis case. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-938, Ritzen Group versus Jackson Masonry. Mr. Lehman. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 28 U.S.C. Section 158 provides that district courts shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final order of bankruptcy judges entered in cases and proceedings referred to bankruptcy judges under Section 157. The order in this case merely determined where the parties would litigate Ritzen's contract claim.
Under Section 158, such an order is not a final order entered in a case or proceeding. As this Court determined just four terms ago in Bullard versus Blue Hills Bank, the fact that an order disposes of a proceeding is not, despite what -- despite what Respondent and the government contends, the test for determining finality.
That, in the words of the Court, slices the case too thin. Rather, an immediately appealable order is determined by considering the larger process at issue and whether the order is final by examining whether it alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties. In Bullard, the relevant process was the plan confirmation process.
Here, the relevant process is the claims adjudication or the claims allowance process under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code. As in Bullard, the order here did not resolve the larger process.
It did not alter the status quo, nor did it fix the obligations of the parties.
On the contrary, it simply continued the automatic stay so the underlying claim would proceed in bankruptcy court. In arguing otherwise, Respondent and the government badly misperceived the role of the automatic stay in bankruptcy cases. The automatic stay is not itself one of the substantive processes of bankruptcy.
It is a utility provision that supports the operation of these other processes.
In fact, it was Jackson who argued that Ritzen's motion for relief triggered the claims adjudication process, claiming the stay motion constituted an informal proof of claim. Such an order changes little and, in the words of this Court, does not alter the status quo or fix the rights and obligations of the parties. Contrary to what the government has represented in its brief, Section 158 was not actually enacted in 1978.
In fact, Section 158 was enacted in 1984.
The reason this, what appears to be a small mistake, I believe, is a very significant matter because it misunderstands the history of the bankruptcy jurisdictional framework. But, as I understand what you've just said, you're not contesting that this was a proceeding.
You're just saying it wasn't a final order in the proceeding.
Is that right? That's correct.
As this Court noted in Bullard, there's an endless number of contested matters, many of which are not -- are -- are of a less significant nature. The question is not on what is a proceeding but what is on an immediately appealable proceeding.
And in Bullard, the Court looked at the process to determine whether or not that had the indicia of finality. And when would that -- when would it become final? At the end of the case? an opportunity for effective review at the end of the case anyway.
So, in this case, as a practical matter, there would likely be a requirement of taking an immediate appeal. Now, on the broader question, the issue essentially is: When a litigant takes an appeal from the final order at the end of the case rather than the final order at the end of an individual proceeding, is he allowed to raise, as a ground for reversal, some mistake made earlier in the proceedings or earlier in the case even if he had an opportunity to raise that earlier on and chose not to do so? The government hasn't taken a position on that.
But, if it would be helpful, I could lay out the arguments on both sides. On the one hand, in ordinary civil litigation, the rule is that you're allowed to raise any error made along the way in the case at the end when there's a final judgment, even if under the Collateral Order Doctrine or some special interlocutory appeal statute you had a right to take up the appeal earlier on and you chose not to do so. On the other hand, there are good reasons to think that bankruptcy might be different.
In bankruptcy, there is this concern about unscrambling the entire bankruptcy at the end because of some -- some error made along the way earlier on. So I -- I -- I think in this particular case the Court doesn't need to know the answer to that question in order to resolve whether an automatic stay -- You're suggesting then that this kind of relief, and motion to lift the stay, should never be considered revisitable at the end, but there may be other types of motions that should? I'm a little confused. We are highly skeptical that this type of order can be a basis for overturning a final judgment at the end of the whole bankruptcy case. We're not ruling out that there might be other types of orders that might be treated -- So an -- But what -- Go ahead. Why shouldn't we just decide this question? What -- what -- why doesn't the government have a position? Why isn't this ripe to decide it now? It seems very tied up in the whole thing. The Court shouldn't decide the question because no one's briefed the question.
And the government doesn't have a position on it because that was not part of the question presented.
It was not argued below. It was not argued as part of this case. When you very objectively and nicely laid out the competing positions, ""must"" certainly seemed a lot stronger than ""may."" That is a fair inference about where the government might be leaning on that question. (Laughter.) I'd -- I'd like to address the broader issue of what counts as a proceeding.
Essentially, when we're looking for a proceeding, we're looking for something that's a case within the case, something that could stand on its own outside the bankruptcy as an independent lawsuit. An example of that is the automatic stay adjudication.
Its equivalent outside bankruptcy would be a freestanding lawsuit about whether to enjoin the creditor from taking particular action against the debtor. And if that lawsuit ends in a permanent injunction, we'd all say that's a final judgment.
In the same way, when the stay relief proceeding ends in a final -- in -- stay relief order, that's a final order as well. In contrast, some of the examples that Justice Breyer raised would not stand alone as independent lawsuits.
Motion for summary judgment, for example, would not be its own lawsuit outside bankruptcy.
It would be part of another lawsuit.
So we wouldn't count that as a proceeding and we wouldn't count the order ending that as final. Why is lifting the stay separate? You could have a lawsuit outside bankruptcy that is analogous to a lift stay proceeding.
This is discussed in both of the conference -- both the House and Senate reports, which is just a lawsuit about whether a creditor should be enjoined from taking action against the debtor. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Lehman. Thank you. I'd like to begin with where the government ended and then move through some of the questions that were raised.
But we have here today the same arguments that the government presented last time. Last time, they took the same position that the Court should determine the finality of the order based on the proceeding.
And the only difference here in their briefing is, well, now it should be proceedings that are significant. The Court rejected that logic last time and it should reject that logic again this time. In this case, I would strongly disagree with my friend, who suggests that the stay has an equivalent proceeding outside. Unlike -- there -- there are things that are similar, such as the claims adjudication process.
That's a state law contract type of claim.
A DIP financing, a debtor-in-possession financing, which would be like a state court lien dispute, or a 363 sale where a state court complained to enjoin the sale or quiet title. But the idea that the stay has a parallel common law state cause of action is not something that is supported and is not something that there's any basis in the briefing to suggest. Now I'd like to go back to the questions raised -- raised by Justice Sotomayor about revisiting the automatic stay, and I'd like to address the four points that were given. First of all, the Respondents actually cited a case to the Court that changed that. On page 38 of their brief, the Gledhill case from the Tenth Circuit actually granted relief from stay and 10 months later then reconsidered and changed that.
Of course, we've granted other circuits where the result was the opposite, where the Court denied relief from stay and recognized that that might change later. Number two, there was a suggestion by my friend that it would require a new proceeding to -- to renew the automatic stay.
That's exactly true.
No different than in Bullard, where it required a new proceeding for a new plan confirmation, but the Court recognized that didn't change the analysis.
The fact that a new plan would have to be submitted under a new proceeding did not suddenly make the old proceeding an immediately appealable proceeding. Number three, the Respondent suggested that the motion to dismiss was not a proceeding, but, in fact, that is -- in fact, it's deemed a core proceeding under 3 -- 157(b). And then, finally, the government suggests in a rather surprising way that there's no basis to suggest that 60(b) -- or -- or that we have to have 60(b) as the standard for revisiting the automatic stay, with absolutely no authority to support that view other than the suggestion that 362(e) somehow imports a standard under 60(b). First of all, there have been no cases to suggest that.
In fact, the only cases that have been submitted to this Court suggest just the opposite. But the Respondent and the government continue to ignore the fact that 362(e) relates only to actions against the property.
And if the Court would look at the appendix to the government's brief, we did not include 362(e) because we did not believe it was relevant. But, on the government's brief at 4A, if you read 362(e)(1), the provision provides: ""Thirty days after a request under subsection (d) of this section for relief from the stay of any act against property of the estate under subsection (a) of this section."" Now, with respect to the questions about the permanent injunction, again, neither party has addressed the question that by definition under the statutory rules, 363 -- 362(c)(2)(C) says that the stay expires.
The word ""injunction"" is nowhere in 362. The stay expires on the discharge, which is what this Court recognized last term in Lorenzen.
And, by definition, it cannot be a final order because it is not a final injunction. It very well may act as a preliminary injunction under 1292(a), but that is something that this Court and Congress recognizes as an interlocutory appeal, not a final order. Now, with respect to the question about the scrambling of the eggs, the concern of the Court has been addressed by what exactly happened here. First of all, the creditors have been paid, as the Respondent represented, but they all got 100 cents on the dollar.
That was represented from day one.
And that was, in part, the basis for the bad faith claim that the bankruptcy was filed inappropriately. So the fact that the debtor -- that the creditors were paid 100 cents on -- I see my time is up. You can finish your thought. The fact that the -- the creditors received 100 cents on the dollar did not mean that this will be unscrambled, but that -- and they received 5.6 million dollars in cash since then, we believe would satisfy any problem that we have. Thank you very much. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1269, Rodriguez versus the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Reich. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is what body of law courts should apply to determine ownership of consolidated tax refunds. In our view, the answer to that question is straightforward. Courts should apply state law.
That's the body of law that virtually always governs property rights disputes in our federal system, and, here, the political branches have not displaced that traditional area of state power either by statute or by federal regulation. The FDIC takes a different approach, although exactly what that approach is has changed somewhat over the course of this litigation.
In the lower courts, the FDIC advocated a rule of federal common law known as the Bob Richards rule, which holds that ownership of a tax refund presumptively resides with the subsidiary whose losses gave rise to that refund.
That's the rule the FDIC has advocated for decades, and that's the rule the Tenth Circuit applied below. But, in this Court, the government has abandoned any defense of the Bob Richards rule, and as our opening brief explains, that rule fails every test this Court has established for the creation of federal common law and contravenes the tax laws themselves. Instead, the government advocates a brand-new rule, one that it's never pressed in the lower courts, and that, to our knowledge, no court has ever adopted.
But this rule suffers from an even more basic flaw than Bob Richards itself.
It simply assumes the answer to the very ownership question at issue. The government's argument starts from the premise that where a parent has agreed to pay its subsidiary the amount of a tax refund, the subsidiary has been vested with ""ultimate entitlement to the refund itself."" That assumption serves as the load-bearing pillar of the government's entire argument.
Yet, it has no basis in state law. The government disclaims any argument it's grounded in federal law, and it can't even find footing in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 1973 Bob Richards decision. Starting with state law, it's simply not the case that where a parent agrees to pay its subsidiary the amount of a refund, the subsidiary necessarily has any property rights in the refund itself.
Rather, there are two possible ways of characterizing that payment obligation, which have substantially different legal consequences. Before you proceed with that argument, you now said your question presented was about Bob Richards.
You say that the government has abandoned that position. The Tenth Circuit, on the other hand, the opinion is shot through with quotes from the contract and what the Tenth Circuit said, it -- it was examining the parties' agreement to determine whether the parent or sub gets this. So it seems that the Tenth Circuit, while it might have cited Bob Richards, was relying on contract interpretation. Why should we take up Bob Richards at all in this case? Because both sides agree that that's not what the affiliated group does not give the parent temporary equitable title to the refund."" So you are bringing up Bob Richards as in support of your position that there's -- that the temporary possession doesn't create the equitable title. That's correct, Your Honor, but that -- that aspect of Bob Richards is an interpretation of the federal tax regulations.
It's not a rule of federal common law.
And it's a correct interpretation of the federal tax regulations. Justice Kagan, just to return to my answer to your question, again, I think on page 16 of our brief in opposition we made clear the very limited work that we think Bob Richards does in the lower courts and in this case. And we said that where the parties have a contract, you resolve ownership under the contract.
And that is our core submission here. So I -- I think, again, it's important to understand what the regulations do and do not do and the fact that the regulations prevent Petitioner from making some of the arguments it has tried to make in this case, but at the end of the day it would be very, very difficult, I think, for this Court to look at this contract and say that, where the parties wrote an ambiguity-resolving provision in favor of the bank, where they specified that UWBI should be a mere intermediary, the parties, nevertheless, unambiguously intended to make UWBI the equitable owner of this refund. Petitioner agrees that he cannot prevail in this case unless he is unambiguously correct.
And the reason for that is not because of a rule of federal common law.
It's because that's the clause that the parties wrote into their agreement. That was the basis of the judgment below.
There's no error in that judgment.
And so that's why at the end of the day this Court should affirm. I also think, as I stated, that I hope the Court will clarify what the regulations do, and make clear that it's easy for parties to specify that a party like the bank who earned the refund is the owner of it. A perfectly sensible way to do that is to say we want to make UWBI the agent.
We want to make them a mere intermediary. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Reich. I think I'll start by what my friends conceded at the podium, which is that on the sole question on which this Court granted certiori, is the Bob Richards rule valid, the answer is no, that that rule is not a valid rule of federal common law and that courts should not apply it. Therefore, the Tenth Circuit erred in saying that Bob Richards clearly applies to this case and sets forth the framework that must govern the parties' disputes. And, Justice Kavanaugh, you're exactly right.
This is a -- the -- the lower courts need clarity on this question.
It's a subject of a significant circuit split of great economic significance every day. The -- the -- my friend argued that this decision didn't play a role, that Bob Richards didn't play a role in the decision below, despite what it said, because everyone ostensibly agrees that where there's an agreement Bob Richards has no effect. That's not the FDIC's position in the lower courts and that's not what the Tenth Circuit said.
Indeed, in its brief in opposition in this case, on page 16, it said that Bob Richards governs unless an agreement clearly addresses the ownership of tax liability and departs from that rule. And in its brief in the AmFin case, which we cite in our cert reply, the government's position, which has been consistent for decades, is that an agreement must contain specific language that conclusively disavows the Bob Richards rule in order to depart from this presumption. So it's -- it's not a rule that vanishes whenever there's an agreement.
It's a rule that all the lower courts understand as a clear statement rule which puts a very heavy federal thumb on the scale in favor of particular allocation of liability.
And that's the role it played in the decision below. My friend says that the sole role that the regulations ostensibly play in this area is clarifying that a party can't claim a federal law entitlement to a refund just because it's been paid to them.
That -- that is a response to a straw man.
That's nobody's argument. Our argument is states' law governs without any federal law preference one way or the other.
And -- Well, I don't want to interrupt your rebuttal but I didn't quite understand his point to be that, that -- that -- I thought his point was that the fact that the IRS for convenience purposes chooses to pay it to the parent is not -- cannot be taken as a factor under state law. I -- I -- Do you disagree with that? We do disagree with that. And we don't think that the regulations say anything to that effect.
The regulations say the refund is paid directly to and in the name of the parent.
And at that point the government's liability is discharged. The regulations express no interest or concern with how state law allocates the refund after that. I will note in their brief they make this point many times, that parties can't claim a federal law entitlement by virtue of that. But the critical point is that others -- Do you think that the -- that the federal government could not make that -- could not take that position? I think it's entirely within the federal government's power to at least dictate a default rule.
And if the IRS enacted a regulation to that effect, we would not argue that's outside of its power.
And, indeed, to some extent they have done so in cases where they've said that refunds should be directed to subsidiaries, in Section 16642-7 and 78 of the IRS regulations. I -- But the -- I apologize for interrupting your rebuttal as well, but just to follow up on Justice Alito's question, do we even need to resolve this? I mean, we took this case to decide the Bob Richards rule. Now we're being asked to address the subsidiary question about the effect of an IRS regulation or the non-effect of it.
Do we need to -- do we need to do that? No, Your Honor.
And I think my friend's suggestion that this argument was raised on page 13 of the Tenth Circuit brief is just not correct.
That -- that -- that page of that brief just quotes the ordinary Bob Richards rule without any suggestion of this new argument about what the regulations mean. And -- and my friend also made this argument that it would seem absurd under state law to not allow the term agents to do all the work of establishing an agency relationship. This is Black Letter common law represented in the third restatement, the second restatement. It's illustration two in the entire second restatement, is making the point that calling something an agency agree -- agree -- an agency does not establish an agency relationship.
And the Colorado Supreme Court has said many times that words are not enough, in the City of Aurora case and in the Moses case.
And this doesn't mean it's hard in any way to assign a refund to the subsidiary. The easiest way to do so is in the government's -- in the banking regulators guidance, their 2014 addendum to their policy statement, which is cited on page 9 of the government's brief, it provides model language that parties can use to achieve the result it's advocating here, which establishes a trust relationship, which is very easy to establish under state law, requires nothing more than designating someone a trustee and requiring funds to be held to -- to -- to be clearly set aside for the subsidiary. And we think that model language is perfectly sufficient to achieve this result. An agency relationship is harder to create.
It requires interim control.
And -- and that's been the law in almost every state and in Colorado for a long time. I -- I -- I'd like to -- Maybe I don't hate interrupting as much, but -- (Laughter.) -- it seems I don't know exactly what you're seeking.
If I say you're my agent, you get this money, pay it over to me in ten days, do I have to tell them how to pay it over to me? Do I have to tell them that I have the ability to redirect payment to someone else? I have to do all those things under Colorado law? May I finish? Briefly. To establish an agency under the common law, the -- the subsidiary would at least need to reserve the right to direct how the subsidiary fills out -- how the parent fills out -- fulfills that task either by having authority to direct it to seek the refund in the first place or direct how it handles the refund once it's received. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1233, Romag Fasteners versus Fossil, Inc. Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act authorizes courts to remedy trademark violations by awarding infringers profits subject to the principles of equity.
The question presented here is whether the -- this phrase ""principles of equity"" requires trademark owners to prove willfulness as an absolute precondition to profit awards. The answer is no for three reasons: First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" signifies a multifactor analysis where no one factor is controlling. Second, the phrase -- excuse me.
The statutory text and structure supersede any settled willfulness requirement. And, third, there was no such settled background willfulness requirement. First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" refers to the familiar equitable principles that courts have long applied in determining whether to award profits in trademark cases.
A defendant's culpability is a weighty factor, but it should not be controlling.
Other traditional equitable factors are also important to further the landmark -- the Lanham Act's purposes to protect consumers and trademark owners' goodwill. Such traditional factors include whether other relief adequately compensates the plaintiff and whether the defendant is enriched by his violation of law. And these factors can all exist along a spectrum.
For instance, culpability can range from fraudulent to innocent and everything in between, including callous disregard and negligence.
So in a case where a defendant is completely innocent, courts should require a greater showing of other factors before awarding profits. Conversely, greater culpability justifies a profit award that deters future infringement.
And courts can be trusted to use their discretion to balance the equities for the cases in between.
The statute also requires the amount of any award to be compensatory and not a penalty, and just, according to the circumstances. Second, even assuming a settled willfulness requirement before the Lanham Act, the statutory text and structure reflect a congressional intent to supersede it.
From the Act's inception, i.e., from 1946, Congress has expressly distinguished and protected defendants and which defendants from awards of monetary relief based on a heightened mental state. Today the Lanham Act contains eight provisions tying monetary relief to a heightened mental state.
That's -- that's a lot of provisions.
The provision that dictates monetary relief, Section 117(a), is the provision that controls this case.
That case -- that provision, excuse me, requires a willful violation for trademark dilution under 1125(c), but no such mental state requirement appears for infringement violations under Section 1125(a) or any other cause of action under the Lanham Act. We think the inference is particularly strong that the omission of a willfulness requirement is intentional.
The same Congress in 1999 that amended the statute to add a willfulness requirement for trademark dilution cases under subsection (c) affirmatively distinguished this type of infringement case under subsection (a) because the amendment simultaneously struck out the word ""violation"" of Sections 1125(a) and then reinserted that same phrase, violation of subsection (a), and then added a willful infringement -- Ms. Blatt, could you concentrate on the word ""equity""? have 37 of the 50 cases which do state a rule, and 13 cases which are fully consistent with the rule.
I think that's at least as good as what the Frag -- But in -- -- Music case was. -- stating the rule in your brief, you consistently say good faith, not willful, innocent, not willful.
But there's a huge gray area, maybe not huge, but there is a gray area of behavior that's not good faith or innocent but reckless but nonetheless is not willful. Right, and -- And that -- and that -- your description in the brief consistent also seems consistent as Justice Sotomayor says with the rule. And I should have made this clear with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question.
Yes, the cases sometimes say ignorance or accidental or something like that. And so -- but there's at least a threshold of actual knowledge. There is no case that she's able to cite in which -- outside of the Oakes language in 1883, that you could read to say that something lower than -- something in which there's objective recklessness is enough to sustain a award of profits.
They always rely on subjective actual knowledge. How about subjective recklessness, conscious disregard of a substantial risk? Yeah.
So, you know, I don't think that -- I don't think the cases have gotten too into that one way or the other, but -- Right.
And that's that's key, right? No, I don't think so. Here, I think -- you know, here the question is that, you know, because here -- the district court here found, this is at page 47A, the evidence at trial at most could support a finding that Fossil was negligent, not that it acted in reckless disregard with willful blindness and the like.
So -- Mr. Katyal, could you explain the features of trademark that make it different from copyright and patent where as -- if I understand correctly, you can get profits without showing willfulness? Yeah.
So trademark law is fundamentally different from those.
Those are about ownership.
Here this is about consumer confusion and protection of consumers. And as our brief explains, once you go down that path, you have to worry -- and this is one of the reasons for the willfulness requirement, that willfulness litigation will be used to browbeat entities like Fossil and to seek massive amounts of profits, every dollar they made, and also downstream, not just the -- you know, not just the designer of the handbags but every entity that sells them, the Macy's of the world to the tune of $7 million. If Congress really wanted to do that and authorize such a revolutionary change in trademark law, one would think they'd say so and not leave it to negative implication because at the end of the day, what she's asking you to do is to say that Congress in 1999 put into the statute something that literally had never been done once in practice.
She has not a single time it's done. That's why this Court in interpreting the phrase ""principles of equity"" in -- in the Halo case said, look to the long tradition, look to what actually happened. You don't need an ironclad rule, just look to what happened.
Here what happened is one thing in the U.K. and in the U.S., for at least 180 years, which is no profits awards in the absence of willful conduct, at least subjective knowledge that what they were doing was wrong. That is the common denominator in Nims, the Restatement, and Ludlow and Jenkins and -- and the 37 cases cited in the brief. No other questions? Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt, five minutes. You may want to cut me off. So I -- I don't know what to say.
I didn't go to a fancy law school, but I'm very confident in my representation of the case law. Mishawaka is a case by you guys and you said in there, in the dissent, it was an innocent infringer, the profits were awarded. The district court case says, hey, I don't like the assertion that innocent people shouldn't get profits, but you guys can read the case and decide whether our assertion is credible but that is a district court case and it's a Supreme Court case by the dissent that acknowledges innocence. Oakes, it is what it is.
You can read it.
And Prest-O-Lite is the same. In terms of give me an example of an unjust case, I would start with this case, the argument is we get zero, even though there was callous disregard, even though their snaps were ripped off, even though it's a small business, even though, you know, that's all they make and it was a counterfeit snap, if we get zero or even a quarter, that would be unjust.
So that's my example. Second, on the treatises, I hope you read them.
Four of them use the word ""damages."" They don't distinguish profits.
They say a principal of trademark law is you don't get damages.
No damages absent willfulness.
He doesn't have a response to that. All of their cases but one say ""fraudulent intent."" So every case that articulates the rule uses the word ""fraudulent."" Not ""wrongful"" but"" fraudulent."" And that's not his argument here. Third, no case that we found under the 1905 Act applied a mental state requirement.
I don't -- I didn't hear him say a case. Four, he did drop the law professor brief, which I'm so glad because I'm going to quote from the leading cite of the law professor's brief, Thurman. The law was quote, ""not clear from 1870 through 1905."" The issue was ""unclear when the Lanham Act was enacted."" Specifically notes -- this is my favorite -- ""there was a majority and minority rule on the subject and the Supreme Court was in the minority."" So you guys had the minority rule because you didn't require willfulness in the Champion Sparkplug case and then apparently you muddied the waters in Mishawaka.
So that -- that's their treatise.
Oh.
Wait a minute, ""the end result is ambiguity."" So that's from their treatise.
And -- and four out of their five treatises use the word ""fraud."" You're quite right that I'll read the treatises and I've read the Lemly brief, and I will read the sources, but I don't understand your statement that they would receive no damages. So -- I thought the statute, that I have in front of me, says that they're entitled to recover profits and any damages sustained. Right. And so you don't need willfulness to recover any damages sustained, do you? Or have I miss understood what -- No.
I'm just saying -- -- they're saying? -- the logic of the Respondent's argument is that the same common law rule that required willfulness for profits in the same breath said fraudulent intent was also required for damages. So it's a -- All of those cases say that -- All of the treatises -- You're right. -- four out of the five. All of the treatises. Yeah, forgive me. One of the cases. Nobody is claiming, are they? I wouldn't -- Nope. No. Nope.
That's our argument. Nobody is claiming that you need willfulness for -- that the client, no matter how poor, no matter how -- he gets his damages, right? Right.
Our argument is -- the other side just wants to take you up to where they win this case.
The actual common law sources say fraudulent intent and it also extends to damages. This is just another way of saying the law was a mess and it wasn't that clear.
When three out of their eight cases say there was a conflict, I just think the whole notion of the Morissette or we cite that Fogerty versus Fantasy cases, if you just have a lack of clarity on the issue, you don't have a basis to presume that Congress wanted you to read in an unstated requirement. And I think in at least in the -- the -- -- the Justice Scalia and Garner book, it says, when you're talking about clarity, it's something that all the members of the bar had to agree was settled, and if the very case as it's -- that was conflicted, if the treatises say it wasn't clear, and if the cases are all over the map, again, the fact that we have three cases where they award profits is kind of either here nor there when we had eight cases that are just inconsistent with the willfulness requirement, including, I will end with, I will sit down early, is Champion Sparkplug case.
It's a case in 1947, it was construing the 1905 Act, said it's relevant.
And then it cited two other factors as part of the equities. That's, to me, you know, just -- it -- it would be hard to find a settled rule from 40 years of silence under the Lanham Act's predecessor.
Thank you. Ms. Blatt -- Thank you. -- Texas is a fine law school. I was just going to -- (Laughter.) Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-328, Rotkiske versus Klemm. Mr. Gant. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While this case is about the FDCPA, it is also fundamentally about the relationship between this Court and Congress.
That relationship has long been governed in part by two important presumptions relevant here: first, that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law and, second, that Congress legislates aware of this Court's decisions. When Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, this Court had long ago adopted a common law rule eventually known as the discovery rule applicable to cases of fraud and concealment. Citing to and quoting the Bailey decision of this Court from 1875, in Holmberg in 1946, this Court stated that it had long ago adopted as its own the old chancery rule, that where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any false or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered, though there will be no special circumstance or efforts on the part of the party committing the fraud to conceal it from the knowledge of the other party. The Court then continued in Holmberg explaining unequivocally this equitable doctrine is read into every federal statute of limitation and added even those where ""an explicit statute of limitation for bringing suit."" The United States concedes, as it has in prior cases, that there is a common law discovery rule applicable to fraud and concealment. In the decision below, the Third Circuit never mentioned the Holmberg case.
Its analysis began and ended with two words in Section 813(d), ""violation occurred."" The Third Circuit understood that those two words by implication, not expressly, but by implication -- that's at appendix page 8 -- displaced the common law discovery rule applicable to fraud. In reaching this conclusion, the Third Circuit deployed what I believe is a false dichotomy, what the Third Circuit described on the one hand as an occurrence rule and on the other hand a common law discovery rule.
And in the view of the Third Circuit, if a -- Congress deploys in a statute a so-called occurrence rule, a common law discovery rule is presumed to be displaced. The Third Circuit cited no decision of this Court in setting forth this dichotomy between an occurrence rule and a common law discovery rule.
The analysis is at page 6 of the appendix.
That conclusion of the Third Circuit is also in opposition to this Court's decision in 1918 in the Exploration case, which is discussed at length in our brief and the briefs of the other parties. There, that is, I think, fairly characterized as an occurrence rule.
The statute in Exploration ran from the date of issuance of a land patent.
So that was a date certain tied to facts. That, under the theory of the Third Circuit and my friends, is an occurrence rule, and there the Court determined that had an express discovery rule and the question is what does discovery mean. So the Court surveyed equitable practice, state statutes, and all manner of things that were relevant to figuring out what Congress meant in that provision. Do you think that that equitable principle is the same as the way the Court has defined equitable tolling, meaning we have very -- we have very strict construction under equitable tolling and certain elements to it. Do you think the same apply more broadly to all the equitable principles, or is it a separate principle all together? So our -- our view -- and I'm not sure anything turns on it here -- is that it's a subset of that broader equitable principle.
You might think of it in terms of the kind of fraud that satisfies Bailey, which is fraud that is either concealed affirmatively or self-concealing, satisfies by itself the extraordinary circumstance requirement of tolling. And then the second element, diligence, is just the same across both -- both contexts. So it seems like a subset of the broader principle of equitable tolling, which explains why the Court's decisions in cases where it mattered, not just in ANZ but in Lampf and in Rotella, described cases like Holmberg and Bailey as falling into this bucket. So we -- we understand it to fall in the equitable tolling or the equitable relief side of the line, but, at the end of the day, to decide this case, I don't think you need to resolve that particular question. If it's any kind of equitable relief, I think Petitioner has disclaimed reliance on that and certainly didn't present that below or in the petition, but even if you think it's a -- a -- a statutory rule that could be read into every statute, we don't think this falls within the category of fraud claims. As Mr. Dvoretzky was explaining, I don't think the complaint here, the single allegation that concerns improper service, paragraph 14 of the complaint, doesn't allege any kind of misrepresentation, isn't premised on fraud. And to the point of amendment, when the district court asked Petitioner's counsel if he would like to amend -- and this is at page 104-A of the court of appeals appendix, Volume 2 -- Petitioner's counsel emphatically said no. So I think that ship has sailed. Ultimately, we don't have a strong interest in whether you apply that rule here or leave it to the Third Circuit, but I think respect for the court of appeals and the integrity of the certiorari process suggests that you should take the Petitioner -- the petition at its word and decide the case on those terms. If the Court has no further questions. I have one. (Laughter.) Why does it matter that it is a fraud claim, rather than, whatever the claim is, fraud has been used to prevent the plaintiff from noticing it? So, if you understand Bailey as an application of more general equitable principles that grant relief not just from fraud but from fraudulent concealment and other kinds of extraordinary circumstances, like the earthquake, then we don't think it does matter. Bailey, I think, is best understood as applying those general principles in the particular context that was recurring at the time of fraud claims. So, if you understand it that way, there's no rigid boundary.
Bailey is simply explaining how those general principles apply in a particular setting. If instead you understand Bailey, however, as a rule of statutory interpretation that departs from the way we ordinarily read -- read statutes, then we'd suggest you should apply that exception, that departure on its own terms rather than expanding it, as I think Petitioner had suggested in the briefing. But, again, if you understand it as an application of equitable principles, you don't need to draw a line between the gravamen of the underlying claim, which is what Bailey focused on, the object or foundation of the suit, or other examples, like Holmberg, which wasn't a fraud action but involved fraudulent concealment. If you view those cases of a piece as involving general principles of equitable relief, then everything hangs together. If the Court has no questions. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Gant. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Perhaps ambitiously I will try and quickly make five points that I hope address some of the questions raised by the Court this morning. First, there's no question that this Court, although, when Bailey and Holmberg were decided, didn't use the label discovery rule. In more recent cases, like Merck and Gabelli, has clearly identified a discovery rule which I think under the best reading is separate from equitable tolling. The second point is that there's an argument advanced in the briefs and today by both counsel for the Respondent of the United States that the issue is whether a statute is all or nothing.
Either a -- a common law discovery rule applies to every claim under the statute or to none at all. That -- that view is unsupported and contradicted by Bailey, Exploration, and Holmberg itself.
Bailey was a bankruptcy court -- a bankruptcy act case.
Exploration dealt with a statute concerning land patents.
And Holmberg concerned the Federal Farm Loan Act. Those were not cases -- the Holmberg/Bailey rule applied to a subset of cases under the statute where the doctrine otherwise applied.
It wasn't all or nothing, as my friends suggest. The third point concerns confusion about the relationship of the doctrines.
Mr. Bond said that the Court has in the past sent mixed signals.
I think that's a fair characterization.
And I think that, unfortunately, those mixed signals caused confusion both on the part of the parties and in the courts below. In Gabelli in Footnote 2, this Court observed that the Second Circuit in the case being reviewed had -- had -- was adding to an equitable tolling claim the requirement that there be some action in addition to the cause of action that caused the concealment.
That is the same idea that is present in Footnote 5 in the Third Circuit's decision below. The Third Circuit said -- and this wasn't -- this was for the Court, it wasn't just on behalf of those four members who would have wished to review equitable tolling.
The court as a whole said our precedent has not previously recognized that a defendant's self-concealing conduct may be the basis for equitable tolling. So the Third Circuit, which, by the way, had gone en banc sua sponte, was recognizing that previously its own cases had said that there had to be some additional acts, not that self-concealment alone wasn't sufficient for equitable tolling, that was the reason why that equitable tolling was not pressed below, because, under existing Third Circuit law, there was a requirement for some additional action, which Petitioner's counsel did not believe was present here. The next point is -- concerns this question of whether the discovery rule is a matter of an exception, an equitable exception to a statute which is imposed by courts themselves, or whether it's statutory interpretation. The touchstone in either case, as Justice Kagan, I believe, was -- was alluding to, is congressional intent.
And we believe that Congress here, when you look at the statute as a whole, not ignoring the language in 813(d) but the statute as a whole, including its purposes, including its exhortation that it wanted to eliminate the practices at issues, clearly would not have meant to foreclose a lawsuit by -- which presented facts like Petitioner's facts here. The final point I'd like to raise concerns -- sorry, one final -- other point related to that. I believe I heard counsel for the Respondent say that under his view the discovery rule is a subset of equitable tolling.
I could understand why one would come to that view given the confusion in the doctrine.
I've set out a different view, which we think is the better understanding. But, if their view is correct, then I don't know how they can argue it was waived.
If the discovery -- the Holmberg/Bailey rule is a subset of equitable tolling, we pressed the Bailey/Holmberg rule below.
Those cases were cited in the supplemental briefing after the Court decided to go en banc. So I think the assertion that the arguments that we're presenting here were waived are -- are incorrect. The final point concerns Respondent's challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint. The district -- the district court in the Third Circuit here understood exactly what was at issue. I must candidly acknowledge that the complaint here was not a paragon of clarity.
It could have been done better.
And if we were given the opportunity on remand, which we would because Rule 15 provides for liberal amend -- amendment of pleadings, we would make clear that the challenged conduct violates 1692(e) and (f) of the statute, which we believe clearly falls within the ambit of the common law discovery rule. Unless the Court has further questions, I thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 19-7, Seila Law versus the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Shanmugam. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The structure of the CFPB is unprecedented and unconstitutional.
Never before in American history has Congress given so much executive power to a single individual who does not answer to the President.
By significantly limiting the President's ability to remove the CFPB's director, Congress violated the core presidential prerogatives to exercise the executive power and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. This Court has recognized and reaffirmed the principle that the Constitution empowers the President to keep principal officers accountable by removing them at will. While the Court created a narrow exception in Humphrey's Executor in the context of a multi-member commission, it has since distanced itself from the reasoning of that decision.
And there's no valid basis for extending it to the The Court should also reject amicus's proposed test, seemingly based on Morrison versus Olson, which would extend Morrison to principal officers and permit significant limitations on the President's ability to remove even his closest advisors. Now, as to the question of remedy, the Solicitor General contends that the Court should rewrite the Dodd-Frank Act to give the President the power to remove the director.
But the constitutional question in this case arises in the context of a defense to an enforcement proceeding and not a facial challenge. The Court can provide complete relief by invalidating the Civil Investigative Demand and reversing the judgment below. In any event, the text and context of the Dodd-Frank Act make clear that Congress wanted to create an agency that was independent to the fullest extent possible and not to vest vast power in an agency that was subject to presidential control without any congressional control over its funding. The government's proposed remedy would have the perverse effect of making the CFPB less independent than agencies it was replacing. The Court should leave to Congress the quintessentially legislative task of deciding how to fix the CFPB's defective structure. Mr. Shanmugam, this case has kind of an academic quality to it.
The demand in question was ratified by an acting head who was subject to the President's removal power, without qualification. I don't see how the composition of the Bureau affects your client since your client was -- the adverse action is now attributable to someone who the President could remove at will. And I don't see how differently you would be affected if the same thing occurred with the President having the power to remove at will. So whatever might have been with the Board head that was responsible for this demand, the acting head is fully removable by the President. Justice Ginsburg, there is a live dispute between us and the government because we want the Civil Investigative Demand to be invalidated and the government seeks to enforce it. On this question of ratification, we don't believe that there is a live issue on ratification, case. Do you have anything you want to say on what I'd call that basic difference of approach in these cases? Yes, Your Honor, and -- and you're absolutely right, this is a basic difference here. The -- the point is that we -- we do not agree -- I do not agree with Mr. Clement's argument that we should water down the standard. But we definitely agree, the House believes -- and notice the House has not tried to have cabinet members be anything other than at will. And I think my friend, Mr. Clement, hit on a very key provision.
One is the succession, that cabinet members who are in the succession, not all cabinet members are -- succession to the President -- but, two, the basic independent powers that the President has because of the Constitution. So it's not just the Defense Department, as -- as my -- So where -- I'm sorry. -- would you draw the line, Mr. Letter, then? If -- I guess I have two questions for you.
First, if -- if the standard isn't watered down, what does that standard mean for removal in your mind? And, number two, what would be the stopping point for Congress's ability to place high levels, serious impediments to presidential removal powers of -- of members of the cabinet and other executive -- what we think of traditionally as executive agencies? Your Honor, I'm going to start with the second one.
I don't know the answer of how far Congress could -- could go, Congress and the President together could go. Isn't that a pretty vital question for us to be able to answer to decide this case? I don't think so, Your Honor, because you have decided in Humphrey's Executor, Wiener, Buckley, Free Enterprise, Morrison versus Olson, you've decided all of those cases and you've said that removal protections are constitutional without answering that question. I -- I searched in vain.
In none of those decisions have you -- No, fair enough. But you're at the podium, so take a shot at it. (Laughter.) They -- I'm going to pick up on a word that -- that I believe this Court has used, which is they should be modest.
I think the test is, Your Honor, what -- again, this Court has said, I believe it's in Morrison, but you've said it in various situations, is it -- does it so interfere with the executive's ability to carry out his constitutional responsibilities? I think that's the test that this Court has -- has said in a variety of separation-of-powers cases.
I know that's -- that's vague, but I can't do better than what -- what you have said. What -- what do you do about -- Well -- I -- I -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Go ahead. I'm sorry.
I hope you'll get to my first question at some point, but I -- No, go ahead.
Go ahead first. Justice Gorsuch, would you mind repeating your first question? I apologize. Sure.
What does that removal standard mean to you? If -- if we shouldn't water it down, what does it mean? Your Honor -- and, again, I'm going to agree with Mr. Clement insofar as this.
A lot of times, this is going to depend on context. So, for example, and -- and, again, this Court hasn't defined what it means, so I don't have a great answer yet from you all.
You tell us what the Constitution -- Your client wrote it.
So I'm -- I'm just wondering what your client's view is.
And you say you disagreed with Mr. Clement on this, and now you say you agree.
So I'm really quite confused. I -- I disagree with Mr. Clement about watering it down.
We don't think that it should be made basically at will. But the -- I -- I will agree -- I don't think Mr. Clement said that either. Oh, I -- I apologize.
I thought he was saying a watered-down version. But, Justice Kagan, I will very strongly agree with Mr. Clement.
It does depend on the -- the circumstances. For example, if a President says, I'm -- I'm firing you because you are investigating one of my big political donors, and I don't like that, so you're gone, I don't think that anybody would feel that that fits within the IMN standard. So what if the President just says we don't agree on policy? Would that be permitted? I don't believe -- I think in Free Enterprise, I believe you said no. So -- so I think you've already answered that. If -- So -- so we don't always think about the future implications of these things, but that's one of the things I've tried to think about. Yes. The next President in 2021 or 2025 or whenever will have to deal with a CFPB director appointed by the prior President potentially for his or her whole term without being able -- given your answer to Justice Alito -- being able to do anything about that difference in policy. Are you comfortable with that result? Does that give you any concern? Should we be concerned about that? It does give me concerns, but -- and I'm -- I'm very glad you brought that up because you've asked that and it's a very key question, Your Honor. What I would say, though, is let's compare it to, for example -- may I finish my -- Sure. If you compare it to, for instance, the Fed, that has seven members who serve 14-year terms.
A President who serves a four-year term is, therefore, very likely to have almost no influence over the Fed.
They won't -- I've not -- I'm not a good mathematician, but I don't think that means that they get to come anywhere close to appointing a majority of the Fed members. So this is a problem that you have already decided to -- to recognize. Mr. Letter, I think Justice Gorsuch's first question is still on the table. As I said, what we -- Thank you. -- what we think it means will be fact-dependent.
It will depend -- as I say, if it is -- it -- it can't just be we have a policy difference.
You've already -- you've told me that. You've already told me that it can't simply be I don't like you.
We -- we know that. But, for example, if it's a situation where the -- the -- the President says you are doing something that undermines national security, one of my core functions, or undermines foreign relations and I want -- and I direct you to stop, an agency that says -- no, I believe that that would be, Your Honor, cause for -- that would meet the standard. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Your Honor. Two -- two minutes, Mr. Shanmugam. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just three points on jurisdiction, the merits, and the remedy, respectively. On jurisdiction, amicus, who is appointed to defend the judgment below, now seems primarily to be arguing that this Court made a mistake in granting certiorari because of the existence of the ratification question. As a preliminary matter, that was flagged by both sides at the cert stage and this Court, nevertheless, granted review, and I would respectfully submit for good reason. Ratification goes at most to the remedy for the constitutional violation here. And that issue is obviously not briefed before this Court.
It was raised by the government in the Ninth Circuit. But notably, unlike in the other cases involving challenges to the CFPB's constitutionality, the government provided no factual support, no declaration, nothing in support of ratification. I think the ratification is deeply legally problematic here, too, and I would refer the Court to the amicus brief of RD Legal Funding if the Court has questions about that, and ratification wouldn't solve the constitutional problem because, even if the CID itself had been ratified, the continued prosecution of this enforcement action would still present exactly the same constitutional concern. Now, on the merits, amicus disparages the notion that the removal power is illimitable.
Ironically, the Court used exactly that adjective in Humphrey's Executor, at least where agencies are performing executive functions. No one defends the rationale of Humphrey's Executor distinguishing between executive functions and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial functions. And our approach gives meaning to Humphrey's Executor and allows the Court to leave it in place by limiting it to the multi-member context. Amicus's proposed approach by contrast would really create an exception without limit. And the exception cannot be limited to cabinet officers because, for those cabinet officers who exercise enumerated constitutional responsibilities, that's only two, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. All 13 of the other cabinet officers as the cabinet is currently constituted would be removable.
The judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below.
You have ably discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-6662, Shular versus United States. Mr. Summa. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Shular has prior convictions for drug offenses lacking the mens rea element necessary to distinguish between blameworthy and otherwise innocent conduct. In 1986, one state, North Dakota, had dispensed with the element of guilty knowledge for its drug trafficking crimes.
Today, Florida is the only state lacking a guilty knowledge element.
Florida's law is an aberration. The question here is whether Congress intended convictions under such an aberrational law to support the extreme sentencing enhancement of up to life in prison under ACCA. The answer is no for a variety of reasons. First, the state offense provision presents a list of generic crimes which all include a mens rea element. Second, the text of the state offense provision itself implies a mens rea element irrespective of any generic offense analysis. Third, Congress described the qualifying state offenses by tracking almost verbatim the language of the federal drug trafficking statute.
Congress used the same terms and even in the same order as the federal statute.
We know that when Congress transplants language from one legal source to another, the language carries the old soil with it.
And here the old soil includes a mens rea element. While tracking the federal statute, Congress used the term ""involving"" to sweep in similar crimes described with different terminology, such as promoting, producing, or furnishing a controlled substance.
And Florida uses the term ""sale,"" which we agree comes under the umbrella of the term -- the federal term, ""distribution."" Finally, since Congress legislates against the background of the common law even in the sentencing context, the requirement for prior convictions for felony offenses itself carries a presumption of mens rea for all the serious drug offenses, federal and state, and shows moreover that the state predicate provision is offense-driven and not based upon discrete conduct or activities. That's a summary of our argument, but I can be more specific.
Here we have a phrase ""manufacturing, distribution, possession with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance."" This phrase incorporates well-known drug trafficking crimes under the federal code. And virtually identical language is used to describe the -- the -- the drug trafficking crime -- crimes under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. In 1986, Congress knew that every state had adopted the Uniform Act to a substantial degree.
It is only natural, therefore, that Congress would use this same language to identify drug trafficking offenses and not discrete conduct or activities under the state offense provision. The difference between the Florida statute and the federal statute, as I understand it, is the following, but you'll correct me if I'm wrong: Under the federal statute, the prosecution has to prove that the defendant knew that the substance in question was a controlled substance; whereas under Florida, that is an affirmative defense, so if the defendant raises the affirmative defense, then the state has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant but the elements of the complete offense or of each of these three offenses in 1986. You also -- And also -- I'm sorry. I was just going to say you emphasize in your brief the difficulty of -- I -- I -- I'll just quote -- ""attempting to synthesize generic versions of these offenses from the motley raw material of state and federal laws."" Your office will keep that in mind the next time you urge us to adopt a generic approach? (Laughter.) I think there's a -- there's a material difference between state drug trafficking laws in 1986, and I think Petitioner acknowledges, and the offenses that Congress recognized were sufficiently well defined in 1986 that it could refer to them by name and understand that -- and courts would understand what Congress was referring to, particularly the offenses that previously had already been defined in the ACCA before the 1986 amendments, like burglary and robbery, which is no longer -- I -- I -- -- defined. I wonder whether you'll also keep in mind this -- this question about involves, you know, the use and carry provision of 924 has kept courts awfully busy, right, what is a ""use""? Are we going to, you know, what is our assurance we're not going to have similar amounts of concern and litigation about what's an ""involving""? So, again, both sides have the same problem with respect to the word ""involving."" And the ordinary meaning of it, as the Court explained in Kawashima, is relatively straightforward. And, again, you look to the ordinary meaning of these words.
The same as you did in Waseem, look at use of force, that connotes a certain amount of volitional conduct.
It doesn't necessarily mean knowing -- The use of a gun involves -- the government has told us involves bartering, it involves -- it's in the room, it's somewhere in the house, it's in the neighborhood.
That's a use of a gun. Why -- why aren't we going to be going down that road here? I don't think that the language compels you to go down the road.
It simply tells you to look to the elements of the offense and determine whether they necessarily entail this conduct. And in this case there's no reason to go beyond determining -- Mr. Bond, Florida is the only state that takes out mens rea; 49 other states don't.
And I don't actually know why it's -- why there would have been a fear of what other states were doing since most of them were adopting the uniform definition of manufacturing, sale, and production -- and distribution. So -- Yes, there might be production uses but I -- I'm not quite sure what the worry on your part is. Well, so -- I think -- if I can challenge the premise about what was clear in 1968, as Petitioner acknowledges, the North Dakota Supreme Court had directly rejected this mens rea requirement.
I don't think it was clear in -- in a number of the other two-thirds of the states whose statutes did not expressly require mens rea. Petitioner cites cases that come long after 1986 or address different enhanced -- But right now, 49 other states include it. We're not aware of any other state besides Florida that has emphatically rejected this -- this knowledge requirement as Florida has done. Either as expressed or implied, correct? We're not aware of a -- of a state that falls in that category.
I'm not sure it is as clear in every state to the extent the Petitioner is describing.
But -- The point of the statute is to tell people who have these prior convictions not to possess firearms? Exactly.
The point of this enhancement provision is those that have three or more -- And there are a lot of people in Florida or who have prior Florida offenses who Congress didn't want to possess firearms. That's exactly right.
And so the idea that we would read into mens rea for these already completed crimes is just detached from Congress's purpose here, which is to impose a sufficiently serious sanction on those who in Congress's judgment pose an increased risk when they possess firearms because of their history of repeatedly engaging in drug trafficking crimes or violent felonies that carry significant penalties, and a -- for the case of drug trafficking crimes, a ten-year maximum sentence or more. If there are no further questions. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Summa, five minutes. The purpose of the statute is not exactly to tell people who have prior convictions not to possess firearms.
The purpose of the statute is to identify those people, those felons who possess firearms but who would also deliberately use those firearms to harm other people. As -- as the Court stated in Begay, identify the people who are likely to point their weapon and fire their weapon. When you have a statute that criminalizes the truck driver who doesn't even know what substance is, that person is less culpable, that person does not have the motive or the intent to defend this unknown substance by violent action or by use of a gun. To the extent that the Court is concerned about the scope and the effect of the term ""involving,"" I think this Court should be guided by the interpretation of the RICO statute in the Scheidler case.
There the statute proscribed acts or threats involving, followed by a list of crimes such as murder, kidnapping, arson and extortion, and in that context the Court said the term extortion must be regarded in its generic sense. And, to the extent that there's still any lingering ambiguity about the scope of the term ""involving,"" the legislative history that we cited in our initial briefs shows the intent of Congress. When Congress drafted this state offense provision, the history shows that Congress intended to add ""offenses,"" not ""conduct,"" not ""activities,"" but add ""offenses"" described generally, which translates to the generic sense. And I would also point to this Court's Moncrieffe decision, when the clerk was confronted with elicit trafficking in a controlled substance, the Court said illicit -- illicit trafficking in a controlled substance is a generic crime. Compare that to what we have here, phrases such as ""manufacture of a -- of a controlled substance"" and ""distribution of a controlled substance,"" these phrases even more specifically describe generic crimes. Their -- Congress uses models to identify predicate crimes.
What we're asking the Court in this case to do is no more and no less than the Court did in the Esquivel-Quintana case, when the predicate crime was described as sexual abuse of the minor and that crime may not be clearly defined, the model says look to a related federal statute. Now, if the Court still thinks there's ambiguity about what ""manufacturing of a controlled substance"" means or ""distribution of a controlled substance"" means, begin by looking to the related statute for how it defines the crimes.
The related statute here is, of course, the federal drug trafficking provision, which describes the crimes to include a mens rea element, and the Court said in Esquivel-Quintana, then look to the survey of state law to see how the states define the crimes and all those factors contribute to the -- to the finding of the definition of what constitutes the generic federal crime. If Congress had before it when it drafted this provision of ACCA these two models, the federal model where the prosecution has to prove that guilty knowledge of the nature of the substance, and the Florida model, which differs only in that the defendant has to raise this as a -- an affirmative defense, has to say I didn't know that it was an illegal substance, Congress would think there's enough difference between those two models to say that only the former is included and not the latter? I think Congress -- yes, Congress would have decided the law is so overwhelmingly in favor of a mens rea element, that's what we generally would contemplate. Is there any practical difference between those two? I -- I mean, I don't see it.
I don't think very many people are going to get -- get acquitted under the federal law unless they're willing to stand up and say I didn't know this was cocaine, in which case the two things are exactly the same. Well, Your Honor, I respectfully say that you are giving short shrift to the general requirement -- my time's up, may I -- You may.
Go ahead. You are giving general short shrift to the significance of jury findings. If a jury does not find, as it does in the Florida law, that the defendant has engaged in blameworthy conduct, the court, in a federal court, in a sentencing proceeding should assume that the defendant did not have that guilty knowledge because the -- the -- the federal sentencing court cannot make that finding for the first time in a collateral sentencing proceeding.
And I thank you very much. Thank you, counsel.

"On behalf of the Respondents 34 We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-1712, Thole versus United States Bank. Mr. Stris. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My clients are beneficiaries of a pension trust.
We allege that the trustees, through disloyalty and imprudence, caused the trust to lose $750 million.
The suit presents a justiciable case or controversy for three reasons: First, my clients have an equitable interest in all assets of their pension trust. That is a property interest.
And when $750 million of that property was lost, my clients suffered a concrete injury. Respondents are between a rock and a hard place.
They can't argue that participants have an equitable interest in only some of the trust corpus, because the trust is unsegregated and undivided.
So they're forced to take the incredible position, to quote their brief, that defined-benefit plan participants have no interest in plan assets. If Respondents were right, no one would have an equitable interest in any of the trust's assets.
But a trust can't exist unless someone holds equitable title to its assets, and that someone here can only be the participants. Second, and independently, my clients have a right to loyal stewardship of their retirement savings.
When Respondents engaged in self-dealing, my clients suffered a concrete injury.
Under the centuries-old ""no further inquiry"" rule, beneficiaries could sue even when there was no conceivable possibility of a financial loss.
The breach itself gives rise to a case or controversy. In any event, and third, my clients have representational standing to vindicate injury to their plan.
Since before the founding, when a trustee was unwilling to sue, equity courts allowed beneficiaries to do so on behalf of the trust. And so I'd like to begin with our property injury.
A defined-benefit plan under ERISA is a private exchange of services. Workers forgo wages in exchange for a promise of a future payment secured by trust property. This is critical because there is an unsegregated, undivided pool of assets, the trust, that pays the pension of all the beneficiaries.
So plan participants, like my clients, have an equitable interest in those assets. Does your argument depend upon a forward-looking theory of injury? In other words, it's -- if -- it's one thing to have a -- a conflict of interest or all the other things you allege that lead to a situation that causes you no direct financial harm, but is your theory that, well, because they did that in this situation, and even if that didn't hurt us, somebody like that is likely to do it again and that might hurt us? Or is it purely the fact of -- retrospective, this person did something that under common trust law would be regarded as a bad thing, and under the no inquiry rule, that's enough, so you shouldn't worry about the fact that it didn't harm us at all? So the answer to that question is we have multiple concrete injuries here.
And the things that we're seeking flow from the particular injuries, -- then they've properly alleged standing and then there would be a factual question -- Yeah, but then you would -- -- down the road. Then it's a question of subject matter jurisdiction under Article III.
So it's not like Iqbal and Twombly where it's failure to -- a question of whether it stated a claim. Wouldn't you immediately file a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction? And that wouldn't be -- the determination of that would not be based solely on the pleadings. Exactly right, Your Honor.
And that's actually what happened here. We dismissed under 12(b) -- we moved to dismiss under 12(b)(6).
That was denied.
I think that was incorrect but it was denied. And then we made a motion under 12(b)(1) and the district court actually engaged in fact finding and found as as a matter of fact that there were -- there was no risk to these -- to the -- That's what I was getting at. Because the plan was actually overfunded, right? I think that's right.
You have a separate factual proceeding on whether the allegation that the employer wouldn't be able to meet the obligations. Exactly.
And that's actually what happened here.
The plan then was overfunded and the overfunding line, that's the line that Congress has -- has drawn, it says if you meet that level of funding in the plan, there's enough there to pay all the future benefits, so this plan at the relevant time was overfunded.
That was the basis for the dismissal here. And I think that -- And Mr. Palmore -- Yes? -- what do you do about the fact that these plans can be underfunded in January and overfunded in February and underfunded in March again? And what do you do about the fact that the health of even, you know, secure companies, if you're in 2008, all of a sudden it turns out they're not so secure after all. Well, Your Honor, I think that's why the -- the -- I think if a plan is overfunded, I think that's sufficient to defeat standing.
I don't think it's actually necessary. And -- and I think for the reasons that you state, if something is toggling between overfunded and underfunded, there isn't going to be standing unless the critical second step of the inquiry can be alleged or factually determined at a -- at the 12(b)(1) stage that the employer won't be able to meet its legal obligations to make the minimum funding contributions to make sure there's enough money in that plan to insure the stream of benefits. But just kind of speculation about AIG and maybe there will be another market meltdown, that's clearly not enough under -- under Article III.
You -- and especially -- and if that's their theory, they picked the wrong defendant because there were, you know, $86 billion in liquid assets at -- Under your theory ---- -- the time. -- the PBGC doesn't matter, correct? I think the PBGC does -- does -- does matter.
It's -- You did not -- you did not articulate that when you articulated -- Yeah.
Well, we articulated that in our brief and the courts of appeals cases that are all on our side do articulate that as well.
That's the ultimate backstop.
And that's funded through insurance premiums paid by the employer. So it's not what -- what my friend on the other side said, that the beneficiaries somehow had their own insurance that would cover the loss. This is part of the employer's obligation to pay these premiums so that there is an ultimate backstop. Wouldn't -- wouldn't that theory, taken to its logical conclusion, mean that a participant could never sue, a defined-benefit participant or beneficiary could never sue? No, Your Honor, because the PBGC guarantees benefits only up to a certain level. Anyone whose benefits are under that limit, they can never sue, is that your theory? That -- that -- it -- that would be a theory, Your Honor.
I don't think -- Is it your theory? Yeah, it is my theory. I don't think you need to adopt that theory here because U.S. Bank by itself was fully sufficient.
But to the extent, again, that there -- and to the extent that that's no employee or defined-benefit -- beneficiary whose benefits are at risk and there -- so therefore wouldn't have standing. First of all, that's not a reason to find that they're standing because there are other enforcers -- the Department of Labor, co-fiduciaries -- but that's actually a good thing, not a bad thing. It means that the employer stands ready to make good on the pension payments just as -- We're told -- -- the rest of the -- You went quickly -- I'm having a very -- You went quickly over the Department of Labor, but we've heard from the Department of Labor, they can't do this job.
It has to be someone who is able to sue. And it's not going to be the trustee because the trustee is the one who has alleged to engaged in imprudent or impermissible transactions. So the only one possible is the plan participant.
So the government itself is telling us Congress set this thing up knowing -- depending on the participant's ability to sue, because the Department of Labor just doesn't have the resources to do the job. May I answer? Yes. The Department of Labor has the legal authority to bring -- to bring an action.
Co-fiduciaries have a -- a legal -- have a legal authority to bring an action. Trustees can bring an action.
You have to look no further than this Court's own cases.
Harris Trust.
It's called Harris Trust because the plaintiff there was the trustee that was suing to rescind a transaction. And in this very case, there was an early claim about a securities lending program that fell out because U.S. Bank had taken action against an employee who had committed misconduct and had recovered that money for the plan. So there are plenty of other tools available, other than fiduciary lawsuits brought by uninjured parties. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Stris. Thank you.
Three brief points.
The first two have a lot to do, I think, with question begging. So the first is we have a concrete property interest.
If we lose that argument, we lose, but saying that we're uninjured doesn't do the work. Justice Alito, you, I think, asked a question that's very important.
You said, well, can Congress put a property label on anything? And I think that goes to the heart of this case because they can't and they didn't. Here's what happens in an ERISA plan: Private parties make a bargain with real private interests and real money.
A worker gives up wages in exchange for a promise to be paid in the future with money put in a trust as security.
That's all fact.
No one can dispute that. The question is do we have a -- an interest, my clients in the trust, and what is that interest? So let's sweep aside the question begging and get to the main issue. Our point is it's always been the case since the 15th century that we have an interest. At first, my friend doesn't dispute this.
Look at page 25 of their brief.
He says in the 15th century, chancellors began to recognize the beneficiaries' interest as a form of ownership, protecting it much like the common law treated the legal interest in property. This is why he spends much of his brief and he gets up here today and he says: Ah, the participants, the beneficiaries, they're not actually the beneficiaries.
The plan is the beneficiary. If he's right, we lose.
But he's obviously wrong, because the beneficiaries are the beneficiaries.
To your questions earlier, Justice Kagan, you don't need to look any further than the congressional statements of purpose.
Everything in ERISA says that to protect the interest of these individuals, we're putting the money in the trust. So that's the property interest. There's nothing abstract about it.
That's how it's been for a while and for good reason. Okay. I'm going to take my points out of order.
The second one is the practical concerns.
What is the good reason? Because I think there's a reason why the United States Government across a number of -- of administrations have endorsed this position of standing.
It's because -- Justice Breyer, you say imprudence cases.
Well, maybe standing should be a gatekeeper, because can people sue in every case, like when there's been a loss -- I get it.
That's a concern.
I don't think it should inform the standing inquiry.
Think of the flip side. The flip side is if their rule is correct, you will have to have, to figure out if there's an injury, a battle of experts in every case about the level of risk and potentially throughout the case about the level of risk. Entirely unworkable.
Again, this shouldn't drive standing, but if it's the elephant in the room.
And in situations of catastrophe like AIG and Enron, there's no solution.
We ask that you reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-916, Thryv Incorporated versus Click-To-Call Technologies. Mr. Charnes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of the America Invents Act, the statutory history, the statute's policy goals, and this Court's decision in Cuozzo all confirm that Section 314(d) precludes judicial review of the director's time-barred determination under Section 315(b). Begin with the text of the statute. Congress drafted the appeal bar to apply to ""the determination whether to institute an inter partes review under this section."" Congress could have written Section 314(d) to review only the determination whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the petition -- petitioner would prevail, but Congress wrote the provision more broadly to apply to the institution decision as a whole. Further, Section 314 itself instructs the director to look beyond that section in making the institution determination in at least two ways.
First, subsection (b) instructs the director to ""determine whether to institute an inter partes review under this chapter."" And more expressly, subsection (a) tells the director to consider the patent owner's response in determining whether to institute review.
And Section 313 says the patent owner in that response can present reasons explaining why the petition fails to meet any requirements of the chapter. In other words, the text of the statute makes clear that the institution determination occurs under Section 314 based on the prerequisites in the entire chapter.
And because subsection (d) provides the institution determination cannot be judicially reviewed, the agency's application of those prerequisites located elsewhere in the chapter cannot be appealed, including Section 315(b). Now the statutory history confirms this reading.
Congress knew how to limit the appeal bar just to the preliminary patentability determination.
That is, after all, how it wrote the similar -- the analogous limits on judicial review for ex parte reexaminations in former Section 312 and inter partes reexaminations in Section 313. The inter partes reexamination statute, former 312, although now repealed, is particularly instructive.
Like with IPRs, Congress included several prerequisites to institution in former Section 311.
But, when it wrote the appeal bar, it wrote it narrowly focused on ""the determination under subsection (a)."" Subsection (a) contained the preliminary patentability standard, which is a substantial new question of patentability.
That -- by writing it that way, Congress excluded from the appeal bar the agency's determination of the statutory prerequisites.
With the America Invents Act, however, Congress broadened the appeal bar in Section 314(d) to apply to the institution decision as a whole. And this deliberate drafting decision essentially refutes Respondents' reading of the statute.
This reading -- our reading of the statute is also confirmed by this Court's decision in Cuozzo. Now Cuozzo dealt with a prerequisite to institution that was not in 314(a).
It was in 312(a)(3), the particularity requirement. Nonetheless, this Court held that it was subject to the -- the Board's assessment of -- the particularity requirement was subject to the appeal bar in Section 314(d). And it's important to focus on what the Court explained -- why the Court explained it what you can't review. Well, again, I don't think it is -- is so broad.
And I do want to make one thing very clear.
The ex parte reexamination under 303 does not proceed the same way that an inter partes reexam or inter partes review does. It -- it mimics the initial examination process, it gives the patent owner vastly greater rights.
They get to interact with the office.
They have additional amendment rights. Yeah, yeah. So the process looks absolutely nothing like inter partes review. It's not just that they can say, you know what, we made a mistake.
We'll just switch -- we'll scratch off -- Right. -- inter partes review and rewrite ex parte reexamination.
It doesn't work that way at all. And it's -- Well, it's -- it's different, I'll give you that, but, I mean, it's focused on the same ultimate question. Well, sure, Your Honor, but -- but Congress decided in granting this new procedure that has a potent -- you know, a potent danger to patent rights that the -- the patent owners are entitled to significant safeguard and the main safeguard that they implemented are the ones in 315. Well, I guess the question, though, that -- that we're struggling with is, so what's the big deal? If you're stuck going to ex parte review anyway, why should we care? What's your answer to that? Well, I -- I think you should care because inter partes review is a very different process than ex parte reexamination.
And, again, if Congress wanted -- But somebody else can -- Spell that out. Spell that out.
Why? It's because, instead of having an opportunity for a single response, truncated discovery, you're in an adversarial proceeding.
You're before a panel of three PTAB judges who might give you an hour oral hearing. You get a long, iterative process with -- with a talented patent examiner who can say this is what I think is wrong, and then you have lots of opportunities to show them exactly why that concern is unfounded. And, again, the PTAB is reversed a fourth of the time.
It's not like this process, because it's so truncated, I'm assuming, is perfect or without error. Well -- But, if it's not with this Petitioner, it can be another petitioner. And -- and if -- And, indeed, even when a petitioner drops out under this statute, the Board can keep the proceeding going without the petitioner.
So the fact that it's this Petitioner seems utterly unimportant under this statute. Not at all, Your Honor. And I think the key is that if Congress thought that the Board -- that the Board can do whatever it wants, it would have mimicked the same language it had in 303 saying they have a sua sponte right to institute review.
This is a procedure that is keyed directly on there being a proper, timely petition. You -- you don't deny that another petitioner can just step into the shoes of this Petitioner. If they file a timely petition, they can seek review.
I absolutely concede that -- And you don't deny that if a petitioner drops out for any reason, the Board can go on without any petitioner? Assuming that it was a properly filed petition in the first place.
We don't disagree with that.
But, again -- It just doesn't seem as though this Petitioner makes all that much difference. Well, Congress felt otherwise in this heavily negotiated process that produced 315(b) as a fundamental safeguard for patents. But, again, why would it have made that judgment, I guess is the question? Why does it matter whether it's one petitioner or another petitioner? Well, because Congress felt that it was important in this adversarial scheme. Why? To -- to make sure that you don't have someone gaming the system, waiting out over a year or even in this case 10 years before they seek review, where you don't have repeated inter partes review petitions filed by multiple people trying to hold up the patent and prevent a legitimate litigation in an Article III court seeking recourse for infringement. There are lots of reasons that Congress would have had in mind.
But, typically, the -- the way the system works is Congress passes a law, the agency gets to enforce it, but this Court ultimately gets to say what those provisions mean. Congress thought this was an important provision.
Congress could have said: You know what, it doesn't really matter if it's timely or not, do your best, agency, and then we'll -- we'll move on.
But they limited this, located it in a specific section, keying it to a specific determination, as this Court has already recognized in SAS, and it said that only that determination, the one under this section, not under this chapter, is a thing cut off from appellate review. So I -- I don't think it's enough simply to -- to throw up our hands and say maybe someone else could come along.
Maybe they can, but maybe they won't.
And, even if they do, they still need to mount a challenge that the director is willing to accept. So -- and I would like to say one other point about the statutory history.
Again, I do think that this is actually pointing in our favor, not my friend's.
It shows exactly Congress following a -- the same pattern in cutting off a similar type of appellate review. It's very narrow. And I think that it would be extraordinary to presume that Congress expanded that in such an oblique, indirect way as they did here. When Congress wants to cut off appellate review and say that the -- the usual Article III function is delegated exclusively to an agency, where no court at any time gets to look through any of these provisions that Congress took care to articulate to limit the agency's power, Congress presumably writes in a clear and unmistakable way. I would submit that I'm not aware of any case that this Court has ever decided that -- may I finish? Sure. -- that would find Article III review cut off entirely based on language as indirect as this. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Charnes. Thank you.
I'd like to make four points. First, with respect to the language under the section in 314(d), other provisions of the -- of Chapter 31 make perfectly clear that Congress viewed the institution decision under 314. For example, 315(c) says -- refers to ""the institution of an IPR under Section 314."" There's similar language in 316(a)(2). So -- so we believe that's all Congress meant by that, those three words, is that institution occurs under 314.
The title of 314 is Institution of Inter Partes Review.
And there's no other provision of the statute that could plausibly involve institution. The second point, my -- my friend referred to several times the Section 303 and former Section 312 and suggested that they're analogous to what Congress did here in 314.
But that -- that's simply not true. If you look at former Section 312(c), what it says is ""a determination by the director under subsection (a) shall be final and non-appealable."" If Congress meant to limit the preclusion of judicial review to the preliminary patentability determination in subsection (a) of Section 314, there is no reason it would not have used the language that was already in the statute, that it was replacing, when it drafted the America Invents Act.
It did not do that. It specifically changed the language.
And that change has to have some -- some meaning. Third, my friend also mentioned, when asked, I believe, what work Section 314(d) did, said that, well, it bans interlocutory review. Well, that rationale was specifically rejected by this Court in Cuozzo, where it said it was not limited to simply prohibiting, you know, interlocutory review.
In fact, it would have been superfluous if that was the purpose of -- of the statute -- of the -- of the provision. And, fourth, going to your question, Justice Sotomayor, we -- we disagree that there's not -- we think there is an asymmetry here if -- if Respondent is correct.
This Court in Cuozzo said clearly that denial of an IPR petition is committed to the agency's discretion. And that means it's unreviewable.
And that's how the federal circuit in several decisions has interpreted it.
In the Wi-Fi One case, which is the en banc case that was applied below, the court said that a denial cannot be reviewed.
And in the Saint -- more recently in the Saint Regis Mohawk case, it said the same thing. So I think you've got an asymmetry here, which is that legal determinations made by the Board in the course of granting review, if Respondent is right, can be reviewed after final written decision on appeal. But, if the -- if the Board denies review on the basis of a legal determination, that will never be reviewed. So here, for -- here, for example, if the Board came to the opposite conclusion, it would not be reviewable. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"The first case we will argue today is Case 19-715, Donald Trump versus Mazars, USA. Mr. Strawbridge. Before these cases -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The subpoenas at issue here are unprecedented in every sense.
Before these cases, no court had ever upheld the use of Congress's subpoena power to demand the personal records of a sitting President, and no committee of Congress had even tried to compel production of such a broad swath of the President's personal papers, let alone for the stated purpose of considering potential legislation. There is a reason that this is the first time a congressional committee has attempted such a gambit.
It has long been understood that because Congress's subpoena power is implied, it is auxiliary and subordinate.
And when that power is deployed against the President, it must yield absent any long-standing tradition or particularly compelling showing of need.
The committees can satisfy neither condition here, and that should decide this case. The committees contend that these subpoenas satisfy the limits this Court has always applied to congressional subpoenas.
But their arguments would render those limits meaningless.
For example, they contend that this Court should ignore the committees' avowed improper purpose so long as they simply tack on a broad reference to potential legislation. They claim that Congress can use subpoenas to uncover individual wrongdoing simply because that will always inform the sufficiency of existing laws.
And they challenge this Court's ability to even question the constitutionality of the potential legislation that they rely upon. The committees' obvious overreach is sufficient to invalidate these subpoenas even in a typical case.
But the Court simply does not proceed against the President as it does against an ordinary individual.
The committees have not even tried to show any critical legislative need for the documents these subpoenas seek. Now it is no secret the relationship between the House of Representatives and the President is frayed, but this is neither the first nor the last time that one House of Congress will be at odds with the President. The rule that the Court applies here will affect not only this President but the presidency itself.
The Court should deny the committees the blank check they seek and reverse the decisions below. Mr. -- Mr. Strawbridge, I want to make sure that I understand the scope of your argument. Your -- your brief begins by questioning whether the House has any power to subpoena presidential records, but you seem at the end of the brief to pull back from that. You say that such subpoenas ""press the outer limits of Congress's authority"" and that there is every reason to doubt whether subpoenaing the personal documents of the President is a necessary incident of lawmaking. Do you concede any power in the House to subpoena personal papers of the President? I think it is very hard to imagine that the House is ever going to have the power, you know, pursuant to its legislative powers, to subpoena the records of the President because, quite frankly, the of that Senator or House member, that would be invalid. Well, let's say they're similar to the subpoenas here.
So they don't have anything to do with the performance of the legislative function.
They are records regarding the personal activities of this individual, purely personal activities.
And we can even say that they concern things that were done before the person was elected to Congress. Still -- and does part -- part of your hypothetical include that they would, nevertheless, be pertinent to a -- a legislative purpose? Well, pertinent to a legislative purpose. Then -- The committee wants to use someone in a leadership position in the other House as a case study for possible legislation. Then, if it met then your hypothetical, I -- I think that -- that would be a valid subpoena.
I'm not aware that it has ever happened in the history of the House or Senate.
I'm -- I'm not -- I don't know of anything that would be like that -- Justice -- Justice Sotomayor, anything further? Yes.
That's the whole point, though, isn't it? Justice Alito is raising this hypothetical because he says shouldn't then we look at history.
And it's only modern history where committees have asked for personal papers.
So he presumably would discount that.
And he would say shouldn't we respect the separation of powers, that what's personal to the President is similarly personal to a Congressperson? Justice Sotomayor, I -- I have to -- to disagree strongly with one thing you said, a key part.
No, the history -- we -- we have history of seeking, Congress seeking personal papers of Jackson, Buchanan, Grant, et cetera.
No, there -- there's been lots of seeking of personal papers by Congress for many, many decades.
This is not just a modern practice at all. So how do we get -- Justice Kagan? Mr. Letter, I'm wondering if I could ask you to comment on a potential difference between, on the one hand, the Oversight and Intelligence Committee subpoenas and, on the other hand, the Financial Services subpoena. The -- the first two subpoenas address the President directly, you know, the financial disclosures that the President makes, conflicts of interest, foreign involvement in Presidential campaigns, but the Banking Committee, Financial Services Committee, you know, was taking a much broader scope. And -- and when the -- when -- when that's true, when the Congress doesn't seem to be looking into the President but in a much broader topic, might there not be some heightened need for Congress to say why it is that they're focusing on Presidential records for that purpose? Your Honor, I think that still would get into -- would raise major separation of powers problems.
As a court would have hearing, the court would ask chairmans of various committees to come and testify as to what they were doing and why. You're certainly right in your description.
This is -- there are 11 subpoenas issued by financial services to members of, you know, banks, et cetera.
And -- and only two of them have to do -- I mean three subpoenas, two entities, have to do with the President.
This is a much, much broader investigation. And last is there's massive public reporting about the -- the -- the subjects of these subpoenas and their banking practices, and Deutsche Bank and Capital One have both been sanctioned many millions of dollars by banking regulators for failing to properly comply with money laundering laws. Justice Gorsuch, anything further? No, Chief.
Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Yes.
Thank you, Chief Justice. And, Mr. Letter, I want to follow up on Justice Alito's question, and this really goes to the fact, I think, that there's concern about what the limiting principle is here, I think, pertinent to a legislative purpose is almost no limiting principle at all, at least I think that's what some of the questions have explored, and his hypothetical about a committee would start subpoenaing members of Congress of the other House or of the other party, and you said, well, that hasn't happened. But isn't the whole point that once you start down this road and this Court articulates too low a standard, that something like that will start happening? That's the concern that I heard identified or that I took away from that hypothetical. So I want to give you a chance to respond to that hypothetical of why it wouldn't spiral. I -- I greatly appreciate that chance, Justice Kavanaugh.
Two -- two responses. First, remember exactly what this Court did in Clinton versus Jones.
And -- and, you know, I was on one of the losing briefs there.
But this Court said we're going to let this happen because -- and then -- but we will -- the courts will monitor the situation and -- and if there are abuses, the courts are still here. In addition, you know, Justice Alito's hypothetical, I also realize it -- it might be there getting into things like privileged information or information involving constitutional liberty interests.
And that's -- this Court has struck down criminal convictions, et cetera, for subpoenas that -- that do involve -- Well, if it was personal records exactly identical to the personal records here but for members of Congress, none of those would apply, presumably, at least under what you've articulated so far today. I -- I think that's right.
But, again, this -- I -- I come back to Clinton versus Jones.
You -- you -- this Court issued a very clear decision saying we're going to allow this one, but, obviously, the courts are going to monitor this. So, if, contrary to what has happened in the past over our -- our lengthy history, if there are situations when there -- the President's ability to do his job is being undermined, thank goodness the courts still exist and they are there to take care of it. Mr. Letter, would you like to take a minute to wrap up? Your Honor, I -- I greatly appreciate that. The -- I'm sorry.
Just flipping back to my notes.
I apologize. As -- as I was saying before, remember that some of the key records here are ones that the -- the President has never seen and never had anything to do with. And the -- we ask the Court to focus on the specific subpoenas in this case because we're not dealing with ""what if's"" here.
We're not dealing with situations where -- like a lot of the Justice Department argument focuses on. As I said before, fortunately, this Court exists to fix those kinds of situations should they arise. Thank you, Mr. Letter. Mr. Strawbridge, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. You know, my friend from the other side struggled with every hypothetical that he was given about his ability to set some sort of limiting principle or some category of information or documents about the President that would not be obtainable under his theory. And I think that's very telling because there are no limits to their theories. And, in particular, let's just consider the example that was given regarding medical records.
There is no reason under his theory why the President and his family and his grandchildren could not be declared useful case studies and, therefore, Congress could send out a subpoena for their medical records. For that matter, the President eats and drinks like everybody else and Congress naturally has the ability to regulate food safety. But that does not mean that Congress can subpoena medical records or even the President's DNA.
My friend refused to even rule out that hypothetical categorically below, and I think it's telling that -- that he can't provide any meaningful limit today. And I think that's consonant with the fact that they failed to consider what their actual legislative need is.
This is an implied power in aid of legislation.
It's not a free-ranging warrant to investigate wrongdoing going back 10 years. They -- he cites to a laundry list of legislative proposals, almost all of which were passed before these subpoenas even issued.
And at no point in the argument section of their brief or today does he try to tie any particular legislative proposal specifically to the President's finances, let alone the vast swath of documents that they seek here. This is not an attempt to preserve the separation of powers.
It's an attempt to eviscerate that. On that point, I wanted to note, in response to Justice Breyer's question, which I may have misunderstood, the Senate Watergate committee, in fact, did serve congressional subpoenas under the legislative power and, applying the heightened need standard, the D.C. Circuit invalidated it, just as this Court invalidated the attempt to hold in contempt somebody in Kilbourn when it violated the separation of powers, just as the lower courts every time separation of powers has squarely been presented have invalidated it. These subpoenas are overreaching. They are an obvious distraction.
They are going to multiply if this Court accepts the path that the House is attempting to lay.
The decisions below should be reversed.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-635, Donald Trump versus Cyrus Vance. Mr. Sekulow. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No county district attorney in our nation's history has issued criminal process against a sitting President of the United States, and for good reason.
The Constitution does not allow it. Temporary presidential immunity is constitutionally required by Article II, and, accordingly, the Supremacy Clause defeats any authority the DA has under state law as to the President.
The Second Circuit is wrong and should be reversed. If not reversed, the decision weaponizes 2300 local DAs.
An overwhelming number of them are elected to office and are thereby accountable to their local constituencies.
The decision would allow any DA to harass, distract, and interfere with the sitting President.
It subjects the President to local prejudice that can influence prosecutorial decisions and to state grand juries, who can then be utilized to issue compulsory criminal process in the form of subpoenas targeting the President. This is not mere speculation.
It is precisely what has taken place in this case and with the subpoena we challenge.
In the argument just concluded, we asserted that the subpoenas did not serve a legitimate legislative purpose and they were burdensome.
Yet, the DA copied almost verbatim the House Oversight Committee's subpoena, with an additional 13 words, which seek the President's tax returns. How revealing.
The exact same language utilized by two congressional committees would subsequently be copied by the New York County district attorney covering the exact same documents and sent to the exact same recipients yet purportedly for two completely different reasons. Under Article II or the heightened scrutiny standard under Nixon, the subpoena we challenge today cannot survive.
As the Second Circuit concluded and the DA represents, the President's being investigated for potential criminal violations in a state grand jury proceeding with a local DA issuing coercive criminal process against the President.
This, he cannot do. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, for all that, you don't argue that the grand jury cannot investigate the President, do you? We did not seek to have an injunction, as was the case involving Vice President Agnew, in enjoining the grand jury. We have targeted the utilization of the temporary immunity here to the subpoena.
That's correct. Well, in other words, it's okay for the grand jury to investigate, except it can't use the traditional and most effective device that grand juries have typically used, which is the subpoena. It can't use a subpoena targeting the President.
And under his Article II responsibilities and the Supremacy Clause, that, is our view, would be inappropriate and unconstitutional. So we have not challenged the -- I don't understand -- I don't understand -- your theory in terms of distraction and all that would seem to go much farther than resisting the subpoena. I don't know why you don't resist the investigation in its entirety or why your theory wouldn't lead to that. Well, our -- our position is that criminal process against the President -- and that's what we're activities.
And that's, I think, what we're talking about. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg, anything further? Nothing further. Justice Breyer? No, thank you.
Go ahead. Justice Alito? One quick question.
I don't know how good this Court is about predicting the consequences of some of our decisions, but would you say that the -- the Court's prediction in -- in Clinton versus Jones that the decision wouldn't have much of an impact on the Presidency has been borne out by history? I guess, Your Honor, I -- I -- my view of the chronology in Clinton v. Jones, I'll try to be brief, is that I -- I think, contrary to some people's view of history, I think that the -- the -- the district court, following this Court's decision, kept a rather close rein on discovery in that case and, don't forget, later granted summary judgment in favor of the President long before trial. It was only that it came out later, of course, that it turns out that in his brief deposition in the case that the President committed perjury, which is what led to the impeachment proceedings and other travails he had. So I don't think it was this Court's opinion or the litigation itself that led to those problems.
Frankly, it was his decision to lie under oath. So I -- I -- I don't -- I think that this -- this Court's conclusion in both Nixon and Clinton that they could not -- you could not, you know, accept the notion there's going to be a parade of horribles, either in a particular case or across the board, still has borne out over history. Justice Sotomayor? I'm not sure that I understood your statement earlier that the only difference between you and the SG -- well, there are two differences, one in -- in the articulation of special needs or heightened standard, but you said it's the burden of proof. But you've already conceded to -- to one of my colleagues that there is an automatic burden on an article -- on the Article II clause by subpoenaing a sitting president, period. No, I've not -- I've not, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, but I have not -- I have not conceded that. All right.
What then are you conceding when you say there's a burden? I'm -- I'm conceding -- And -- and what kind of burden are you talking about? And, number three, articulate more precisely what problems you have with the heightened standard that Nixon set in its grand jury subpoena. Yeah, I guess, in my response, I think, to Justice Gorsuch, my concern -- my -- what I acknowledged was that, yes, a subpoena like this implicates Article II issues and potential burdens, and it's those which have to be weighed in a case-specific analysis. I wasn't conceding that the mere fact of a subpoena imposes ""an Article II burden."" I think that's -- that's the distinction I would -- I would -- I would draw. And, again, getting back to the language question, I -- again, it's the DOJ's language that calls for a stringent showing that a request is directly relevant to central issues at trial and specific charging decisions. And, again, very simply, as a practical matter, no court and no prosecutor could -- could meet that standard because, in a grand jury, one is not thinking about charging decisions or central issues at trial.
And that's why I think the simple language that the DOJ is -- is applying in its new heightened showing standard is just not workable. Justice Kagan? Mr. Dunne, on -- on the question of a possible distinction between state prosecutors and federal prosecutors, the President's lawyers have urged that there's a legal difference arising from the Supremacy Clause.
And I don't think we've talked about that argument yet. What -- what is your response to that? I think the response, Your Honor, is -- I alluded to it before.
But I think all it means is that there is a -- a balance to be struck between, in this case, the state prosecutors, the Supremacy Clause concerns, against the rights of states under their police powers and the concepts of federalism and the -- the requirements of the Tenth Amendment to allow the states to exercise their -- their rights, especially in the criminal context, which, you know, are -- are so important. So I think that that's the parallel to the -- the balancing in the -- in the federal prosecutor context, but I think it's even more important given the federalism concerns and the fact that, you know, state prosecutors, of course, not only do they have the reserve police power of the states, but in -- in context of criminal investigations, there, a large body of criminal conduct is only prosecutable by the states.
So that's the thing that has to be balanced here. Justice Gorsuch? Nothing further. Thank you, Chief. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. I just wanted to ask again, deferral of the investigation until after the presidency, assuming statute of limitations issues were solved -- which is a big assumption, I understand -- can you tick off the concerns you would have about that so that we have those clear? Yes.
Yes, Justice Kavanaugh.
Again, it's -- point number one would be the -- putting aside statute of limitations concern, which I don't think one can discount here because I don't think it's been addressed, you know, ever, obviously, by this Court in -- in this context, and that's what we're -- that's our paramount concern, to be honest, at this point because the clock is ticking. But even if that were to be addressed somehow, the risk of -- you know, over time by waiting, of losing evidence and losing witnesses and that kind of thing is a very real risk. Again, I think the OLC Moss memo addressed that expressly in -- in saying that a grand jury proceeding should be allowed to proceed. But, secondly, here -- and it's not unusual -- since there are other third-parties at issue in the investigation, requiring us to delay because a president is still in office as to those third-parties in -- in gathering important evidence could yield them being above the law if the statute of limitations runs as to them. Thank you. Mr. -- Mr. Dunne, would you like a minute or two to wrap up? Yes, Your Honor, thank you. Your Honors, the issue presented here today is extremely narrow but extremely important.
We have a state investigation that's well founded, implicates no official conduct or executive privilege, involves a variety of third-parties, faces serious time constraints, and has been found to impose no Article II burdens. These facts put our subpoena well within the scope of legal process permitted by this Court for generations, indeed, back to 1807.
Past decisions have consistently found that courts already have robust tools to protect presidents from abusive claims or demands. There's no need here to upend precedent or to write a new rule that undermines federalism, especially when such a rule would create a risk that American presidents, as well as third-parties, could unwittingly end up above the law. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sekulow, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start with this, and there's some agreement.
The New York district attorney, New York County district attorney, acknowledges that their subpoena implicates Article II issues and burdens.
They also agree that there is harms that could arise to the presidency.
We say those harms have actually existed. The other aspect of this is the ordering, who carries the burden here.
That seems to be the issue that's left open.
This Court's decision in Cheney answered that very clearly, that said that the exacting standard is carried by the party requesting the information. So it would be carried by the Respondent in this particular case. There has been no showing and no findings of heightened need standards being met here.
That -- and I think it's again also important to remember -- and I think this came up in the context of earlier questioning -- there's a different stigma that attaches to criminal process than civil litigation.
And I don't think that stigma should be ignored in a case like this. But the irony of all of this is that the House of Representatives and the district attorney issued essentially the same subpoenas to the same custodian for the same records. The House said it wants the records so it can legislate, not for law enforcement reasons.
The district attorney says he wants the same records for law enforcement reasons; he has no legislative authority. But what's really happening here could not be clearer.
The presidency is being harassed and undermined with improper process that was issued, in our view, for illegitimate reasons.
The copying of the subpoena speaks to that. The framers saw this coming, and they structured the Constitution to protect the President from this encroachment. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-46, United States Patent and Trademark Office versus Booking.com. Ms. Ross. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is a fundamental principle of trademark law that no party can obtain a trademark for a generic term like ""wine,"" ""cotton,"" or ""grain."" As Judge Friendly explained and as the Lanham Act confirmed, a generic term is never entitled to trademark protection no matter how much money and effort the user has poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what success it has achieved in securing public identification. In other words, secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness is simply irrelevant to generic terms.
That principle controls here. It is undisputed that ""booking"" is generic for the hotel reservation services Respondent provides.
Respondent thus could not federally register ""Booking."" Nor could Respondent register ""Booking Company"" or ""Booking Inc."" In Goodyear, this Court held that the mere addition of an entity designation like ""Company"" or ""Inc."" to an unprotectable term does not create a protectable mark.
That is because those terms indicate only that parties have formed an association or partnership to deal in the relevant goods.
By prohibiting a first adopter from obtaining a trademark in a phrase like ""Booking Inc.,"" Goodyear ensured that no party can monopolize a generic term. The same result should apply to Booking.com.
The addition of "".com"" is the on-line equivalent of ""Company"" or ""Inc."" It conveys only that Respondent provides its services via a commercial website on the Internet.
There is no sound reason for Respondent to be able to federally register ""Booking.com"" as a trademark when it couldn't register ""Booking, Inc."" Registration would effectively give Respondent a monopoly on the words ""Booking.com"" and would interfere with competitors' ability to use similar domain names.
That's particularly problematic because it's how the Internet works. Only one entity can obtain the contractual rights to a domain name at a time.
So Respondent already enjoys significant competitive advantages that brick-and-mortar equivalents like ""Booking Inc."" would lack. That same feature of the Internet also means that if Respondent's survey evidence is enough to obtain federal trademark registration, that nearly every generic.com business can do the same.
Because domain names are one of a kind, a significant portion of the public will always understand a generic "".com"" term to refer to a specific business, even if it is not familiar with the particular business at issue -- Counsel -- -- thus resulting in -- -- counsel, you mentioned the Goodyear case, but you did not quote the language from the trademark statute that is at issue here.
That language says that the primary significance of the mark to the public shall be the test for determining whether the mark has become generic. Now the Goodyear case had a different test, an absolute rule.
And it seems to me that, in trying to decide what Congress had in mind, it makes more sense to follow the language that Congress chose in the statute rather than a 130-year-old case of ours. So, Mr. Chief Justice, two a -- is a real store. So only about -- as -- as I understand it, about 41 percent on a net basis recognize your mark.
What -- what do we do about that? What -- what should we say in this opinion, if anything -- Well -- -- about the standard -- Yes.
So -- -- if not the facts? Okay.
So you've read the Tushnet brief and the government's brief.
You have not obviously read our expert -- Well, now -- -- that explains how -- -- that's not fair. Now come on. Okay.
So why it is so funny is that you would never net them out.
You don't take 74 and subtract 33.
It's just based on a -- like, a very sort of lack of understanding of survey methodologies. You net out the participants.
And so, when you net out the participants, you say Lisa Blatt dumbly thought washington. -- washing -- washingmachine.com was a -- was a -- was a brand, so we're going to take her out of the survey.
So, if we look at the people who correctly saw washingmachine.com as generic, 64 percent still saw Booking.com. And so I guess I can say is there's just -- there's an extensive discussion of this in the -- Oh, I -- I understand that.
I'm -- I'm trying to extract just a level up from the facts -- Okay.
Okay.
I'll -- -- and ask for your guidance as to what the Court should say with respect to these kind of survey methodologies, if anything. So I think -- Briefly, Ms. Blatt.
Ms. Blatt? Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
So what I would say is that, you know, the survey is -- the survey instructs the consumers -- I'm sorry, the participants ahead of time that ""office supplies"" is a common -- ""officesupplies.com"" is generic.
And if they didn't understand that, they couldn't take the survey, that staples.com was a brand and officesupplies.com is generic.
If the -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Blatt.
I want to make sure I understand what you think about our precedent in Goodyear exactly. Could the principle of Goodyear still have some value outside the "".com"" context in the classic company context in which that case arose because the "".coms"" are inherently unique, or is your position more broadly that Goodyear just has no value anymore? So I'll -- I'll fall back to certainly you shouldn't extend it to "".com"" because "".com"" is closer to the words ""store"" and ""shop"" -- and ""shop."" But, if you took Goodyear at its word, you're killing non-profits because of the association problem. Goodyear -- the terms of the opinion say it means association.
And that's how non-profits identify themselves.
So we have -- or a coalition or a society.
And so you have the Amputee Coalition, the Christian Coalition. You have -- there are so many of these associational marks that I think Goodyear would destroy, in addition to ""foods co."" or ""Container Store."" And I -- I just want to say one thing about the government's making fun of the Cheesecake Factory.
""Crab House"" is not a little house where crabs live.
They're actually dead and you eat them.
And the government thought ""Crab House"" was generic. So, if you go down this road of thinking that certain words are off limits, I just think you're creating a real mess that's very unstable, unprincipled, and unworkable and unclear. Picking up on Justice Kagan's line of questioning, it seems that your rule invariably will lead to a situation where most every "".com"" business that sells good or -- goods or services will be able to obtain a trademark.
Maybe -- in other words, your position leads to the opposite kind of bright-line rule.
Maybe that's okay, but is that wrong and, if so, when -- when wouldn't it be? I think it's wrong, but I -- I hear that -- I hear at least six of you concerned about it, so I can try to help on -- on this. What you can do is make clear in your opinion that a district court, if there is evidence of -- from all kinds of sources that the PTO uses and all those examples I gave in the beginning, they cite all kinds of examples proving that generic word "".com"" marks flunk the primary significance test -- that the PTO can look past survey evidence and so can courts if you're really worried about a survey bias. Now we have a whole brief of survey experts saying this was a great survey.
So I -- I hate to trash our survey.
A lot of people thought our survey was great.
It's the -- it's the classic Teflon survey. But, also, let me just take you to Waffle House.
Waffle House, there was a fight about the survey.
The -- the PTO said it was generic, and Waffle House came in with a survey and they -- they trademarked it.
So I -- I don't know why "".com"" is having some sort of, you know -- it's scary and, therefore, it should be treated differently because of this fear that all "".com"" marks have an unfair advantage because of a website.
It's -- you know, the PTO has been doing this for -- for two decades now without a problem. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross, you have three minutes for rebuttal.
Ms. Ross, three minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Sorry about that. The -- if I could just focus on three main points.
First, I think Respondent's rule operates from the presumption that the Lanham Act knocked out all prior common law unless it was expressly preserved.
That's the opposite of the way that we usually think about statutory change.
I think just a couple of weeks ago in Romag, this Court, nine justices, looked to the common law to determine what the Lanham Act preserved.
And I think the same should be true here.
That's particularly so because, in the examples that Respondent cites, like the geographic terms and descriptive terms, Congress was clear when it wanted to overturn pre-Lanham Act precedent. I think, on the second point, Respondent suggests that the primary significance test did it.
In particular, I think I heard my friend just suggest for the first time today that Kellogg itself did it. That's inconsistent with the position that they take on page 22 of their brief, which acknowledges that Kellogg actually discussed the primary significance test to determine when a descriptive term would get protection under unfair competition law, so that's entirely consistent with the view here that generic terms are never susceptible to trademark, even with primary -- even -- or even when a showing of secondary meaning has been made. Again, we think that the primary significance test coexists with prior law, which includes Goodyear.
And I think Respondent points to this idea that the PTO has been applying the primary significance test.
That's true with the Goodyear sort of guardrail.
It understands that a generic term can't be made into a trademark simply by showing that a bunch of consumers think that it -- it's associated with a particular mark or a particular brand. Now Respondent's example actually -- or Respondent's survey actually proves this point.
There was a lot of back and forth about washing -- ""washingmachine.com"" versus ""Booking.com,"" but I think what's really instructive here is ""washingmachine.com"" versus ""supermarket."" Thirty-three percent of Respondents in Respondent's survey thought that ""washingmachine.com"" was a brand name.
Zero, not a single survey respondent, thought that ""supermarket"" had that -- that characteristic. So, clearly, the .com context is doing a ton of work on Respondent's view. The third point that Respondent really hit was this idea that there wouldn't be any competitive harm from Respondent's rule.
I think that's clearly not correct. We know that because of the same reason that we know that booking companies shouldn't be allowed to be trademarked.
We just know that when you have -- that a trademark law is not supposed to take terms off the table, that everyone needs to describe their goods. I think, you know, Respondent focused on certain examples, like ""tickets.com"" and ""Container Store."" I think, again, Respondent is misunderstanding that you have to always look at how -- what those are registered for.
So ""tickets.com,"" for example, for ticket management services, not for tickets generally. So they're massively overstating what's going on here. I think, again, there might be hard questions at the margins on some of these, whether something like ""container"" or ""tickets"" is being used in its generic sense, but that's not reflective of the .com or the company. That's at that first root level. Finally, I think, if they're not going to sue ebooking.com and hotelbooking.com, it's really unclear what they want out of this. Ripping off Respondent referred to is covered by unfair competition.
Typosquatting likewise is covered by unfair competition.
And Section 1125(d), which Respondent pointed to, presumes that you have a preexisting trademark like Kodak or like Xerox or like Teflon in the old days, and someone goes along and -- Thank you, counsel. -- gets the trademark -- Thank you, counsel.

"This morning we will hear argument in Case 19-177, United States Agency for International Development versus the Alliance for Open Society International.
I note at the outset that Justice Kagan is recused in this case. Mr. Michel. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Twenty years ago, the HIV/AIDS pandemic was devastating the world.
In response, President Bush proposed and Congress adopted the Leadership Act.
Since reauthorized three times, the Act has committed nearly 80 billion dollars to global AIDS relief, and it has worked, saving more than 17 million lives in the most successful American foreign aid effort since the Marshall Plan. The funding condition at issue here requires recipients to have a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, which Congress found are coercive practices that spread HIV/AIDS and degrade women and girls.
This Court held that applying that condition to Respondents' domestic entities violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.
But Respondents sought more, and the question now is whether the condition can still be applied to foreign grant recipients operating abroad. It can for two straightforward reasons.
Foreign entities lack constitutional rights, so they cannot bring an unconstitutional conditions claim, and neither can Respondents because they are not subject to the funding condition.
Thanks to their victory in this Court, Respondents can accept and use funds without any compelled speech.
To be sure, Respondents can choose to affiliate with foreign entities that must comply with the policy condition, but any effect on Respondents' message is now a product of their own choice, not government compulsion. Respondents' contrary view is startling.
They would allow U.S. non-profits to export constitutional rights to legally separate foreign entities abroad simply because they share similar brands.
That novel theory has no basis in this Court's prior decision, it could undermine long-standing regulations of foreign speech, and it has no practical justification. For 17 years, foreign recipients have adhered to the policy condition without harming the AIDS relief program or Respondents' speech. This Court afforded Respondents all the relief they deserve.
The decision below should be reversed. Counsel, one thing that I think is not clear from the record is the precise relationship between the domestic entity and its foreign affiliates.
We -- we know that there are no formal corporate ties but that these entities share the same name, the same logo, the same brand. What -- what would you require beyond that before attributing the speech of the foreign entity to the domestic one? Mr. Chief Justice, you're correct that the record is not particularly thorough on that issue, despite 15 years of litigation on -- on this matter.
The district court ultimately entered the injunction it issued here based simply on -- on letter briefing. But our position is that the formal distinction between the two entities, the -- the U.S. entity and the foreign entity, is all that is required to attach separate legal rights. Of course, it's important to note the Respondents and the foreign entities that they claim as affiliates made the choice to be separate legal entities.
That choice, of course, has mired into the corporate formalities, which we don't advocate. Rather, we think a more limited holding based on the nature of speech and the First Amendment would suffice. On -- on that score, what evidence is there that there is this risk of confusion or attribution, given that the domestic entity is free to disavow the statements of any foreign affiliates? What -- it seems to me an empirical question.
Do we have any empirics? Yeah, I think the best evidence is -- is in the record in the unrebutted sworn declarations of these organizations, which talk about how they are perceived in the public health community, the price they are paying in the form of hypocrisy and the way that they lose their integrity and their reputation and their brand when they're forced to speak out of two sides of their mouth. The -- the declarations that were -- I -- I understand -- I understand that harm, counsel.
And I'm sorry to interrupt, but I -- I understand the harm that -- that people will see the disavowal and will -- will take cognizance of it. But is that the same thing as anyone really thinking that the domestic entity abides by the government restrictions and endorses them? Does anyone really think that when they -- when they -- when they read that, or do they think that this is a statement made by a foreign entity in order to secure U.S. dollars that obviously the U.S. entity itself does not promote or agree with? Why wouldn't that be the natural reading by the -- by the average reader? Well, I think, when these public health organizations take a pledge saying that they believe something, I think people take it very seriously.
When they say that they believe that HIV/AIDS is transmitted in a certain way or when they say they believe that prostitution should be dealt with in a way that stops the spread of the disease, people listen to them. The reason they're so effective in these programs -- I'm sorry, counsel. Counsel, I accept that, again.
That's not really quite my question. Couldn't a reasonable person hold in his or her mind two things: one, the foreign entity believes X; two, the domestic entity does not believe X? Well, Your Honor, I think that falls apart when the organization speaks with one voice, as these organizations do.
They -- they have a right to speak that way.
They have a right to -- to join with their affiliates in having their -- their -- their common voice and their common mission. And when they're told to say one thing and then disavow it in another breath, I think it undercuts their reputation and brand and their own speech. Well, are -- I think Your Honor had it exactly right. -- are we back then, counsel, to -- to the -- the belief that people will always confuse this as one entity and it's not possible for a local chapter of an organization to have a different view than the national organization or the international organization? That people cannot hold that -- that concept in their heads? Briefly, counsel. Yes, briefly.
I think the public doesn't know that these are separate corporations.
The problem is they're -- they are indistinguishable and they -- they look to the public to be exactly the same. And so it really would be more like Your Honor's case in Masterpiece Cake Shop, making the baker say one thing and then attempt to disavow it in the next breath. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, counsel.
I want to clarify, first, one thing from your colloquy with Justice Ginsburg.
You agree, I assume, that unaffiliated foreign entities acting abroad have no constitutional rights under this Court's precedents? We do, Your Honor. Okay.
And then I want to pick up on Justice Alito's concern or question about the foreign policy effects of your approach, and I have a hypothetical as well. Suppose the U.S. government wants to fund foreign NGOs that support peace in the Middle East but only if the NGOs explicitly recognize Israel as a legitimate state.
Are you saying the U.S. can't impose that kind of speech restriction on foreign NGOs that are affiliated with U.S. organizations? I think that's a -- a harder case, because I don't -- I don't hear that as requiring affirmation of a belief. Rather, it's in recognizing a fact that the U.S. has established a certain diplomatic relationship with -- with Israel, and the U.S. government gets to say what that relationship is for the United States. I don't think that's making the entities espouse that view as their own.
And so I think that's different.
I think that would be acceptable. That would be acceptable in your view? I -- I think it would be. Okay.
And then the government says that your position would unleash foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations to pump money into the U.S. election process. And I wanted to give you a chance to respond to that claim, which was in the government's reply brief and then repeated here today. Yeah, I -- I disagree with that.
That's a very different case.
That is a -- that is a speech restriction.
It is not speech compulsion.
And that restriction doesn't apply to the U.S. organizations. And so -- and I think this Court dealt with that the right way in Citizens United and distinguished the foreign organizations from the U.S. organizations, and it's a different case. Thank you, counsel. One minute to wrap up, Mr. Bowker. Thank you, Your Honor. Applying the policy requirement to foreign members of these tight-knit international entities fighting HIV/AIDS overseas puts words in the mouths of the U.S. members of those entities, and the program regulations effectively prevent the U.S. members from even disavowing what the foreign members are compelled to say. The injunction should be upheld. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel, three minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just a few points in rebuttal. First, to respond to Justice Sotomayor's question about facial invalidity, Footnote 1 of our reply brief explains that the government's prior submission was clear that the statute was -- it was being challenged only with respect to domestic entities, and, in fact, a true facial invalidation would invalidate the statute even as applied to foreign entities that have no connection to the United States, which I take it my friend has just conceded is not his position. Second, my friend concedes -- my friend stated that the U.S. entity truly is in control.
And I think that's exactly right.
But that ultimately underscores that it's the U.S. entity, the holder of the First Amendment rights, that is making a choice to affiliate with a foreign entity that accepts Leadership Act funds. Unlike in this case last time and unlike in cases like Hurley and Masterpiece, the U.S. entity is not required to make that choice. The U.S. entity has a separate choice to accept Leadership Act funds itself and operate itself without -- in -- in foreign countries without any risk of hypocrisy or -- or a mixed message. As Justice Gorsuch says, you have to take the sweet with the sour when you decide to set up a separate corporate entity. Now my friend suggests that either U.S. funding conditions or foreign law somehow give an incentive for -- for U.S. entities to use foreign affiliates, but they're not challenging any U.S. funding decisions, which would, we believe, beyond -- be beyond challenge anyway.
And foreign law certainly cannot change the scope of a U.S. entity's First Amendment rights. My -- my friend's position ultimately rests on what he frames as a risk of attribution test.
But I think Judge Straub got it right below when he called that position startling. As Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Alito both, I think, alluded to, that test would be unworkable and it would call into question all manner of U.S. speech restrictions on foreign entities abroad. Now my friend says there's a distinction between speech restrictions and speech compulsions, but the risk of attribution test that he has outlined, where you simply compare names, logos, and brands, has nothing to do with the distinction between speech attribution and speech compulsion. And in all events, the foreign entities here are only, if the -- if the U.S. entities choose, required to make the statement in a -- in a letter to USAID, not to shout it from the mountaintops and not to say anything that will ultimately interfere with the U.S. recipient's message. Finally, I want to note Respondents never made this argument for more than a decade of the litigation.
I think what happened is that, having secured rights for U.S. entities, they decided to ask for the world. But there's no basis in this Court's prior decision or any other source of law for that -- for that holding.
It would invalidate a provision that Congress has adopted and reauthorized and that is working. The decision below should be reversed. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1587, the United States Forest Service versus Cowpasture River Preservation Association, and the consolidated case. Mr. Yang. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the Trails Act converts all federal, state, and private lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail into lands administered by the Park Service.
It does not. The Act simply charges the Secretary of the Interior with overall administration of a trail.
It repeatedly distinguishes between the agency administering the trail and the land managing agencies administering the land.
The Park Service thus coordinates -- or -- agencies and organizations responsible for their own segments of the trail, and informs certain trail-wide responsibilities, but the land managing agencies ultimately -- ultimately take care of the trail on their lands. If a tree falls on Forest lands over the trail, it's the Forest Service that's responsible for it.
You don't call the nine Park Service employees at Harpers Ferry and ask them to come out and fix the tree. Respondents' theory is inconsistent with the Act and would dramatically change the national trail system.
Respondents, for instance, argue that the trail is land and it's administered by the Park Service.
So their position is that the entire trail is federally administered -- a federally administered area of land. But if you look at page 14a, this is Section 1246(h)(1), it requires that the Secretary shall encourage states to operate, develop, and maintain portions of such trails -- and this is scenic trails -- located outside the boundaries of federally-administrated areas. If they're right, there is no thing, nothing, outside the -- the trail outside the federally-administrated areas because the trail is a federally-administered area.
Their reading cannot be right. Second -- it would also dramatically increase -- dramatically change the trail system by transferring vast amounts of land into the National Park Service, which the Park -- the Park System, which the Park Service administers and regulates to conserve the natural environment.
Not only would TVA's two hydroelectric dams be put in the system; nearly a thousand miles of the Forest Service lands, more than a dozen towns, including Hanover, New Hampshire and Dartmouth College, which crosses straight through, numerous bridges over rivers, including the bridge over the Hudson near West Point, over 600 roads, a hundred interstates and other highways.
And until this case, no one has ever thought that such all lands and waters under the trails were -- Mr. Yang, may I ask you a preliminary -- Sure. -- preliminary question? This issue of the Mineral Leasing Act is the third of the issues that the Fourth Circuit dealt with, and it was the one to which they devoted the least number of pages. This case, in any event, am I right, is going back for reconsideration of the environmental consequences, going back under the Forest Management Act and the National -- NEPA? Correct. So, since those reviews will be going on, is there the potential that the Mineral Leasing does not completely repeal the Weeks Act.
It just layers onto the Weeks Act jurisdiction in the Secretary delegated to the Park Service that goes along with the Weeks Act, and then assumes that these two agencies will figure out a sensible distribution of regulatory and other authority. And if that's the case, and that's what happened -- has happened, do you -- does -- does -- is it necessarily true that the Secretary has authority over the right-of-way that's at issue here? Well, 1248(a) says explicitly that it's either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, and as the case may be, we know refers to the Secretary who administers the land. The government in its reply brief recognizes that's a fatal point for them, and so they try to say, no, it's not really mean that, but two provisions before in 1246(i) Congress uses the phrase ""as the case may be"" in a context that unmistakably refers to the Secretary administering the trail. So that means the Secretary of the Interior, and only the Secretary of the Interior can grant the rights-of-way in question here. So -- Mr. Kellogg -- -- the head of the Forest Service -- -- I'm sorry, did you misspeak? You answered Justice Kagan by saying if we believed there was dual administrative powers, that we had to reverse, but I thought you won below? I'm sorry, then you'd have to -- Affirm? I'm sorry, then the Fourth Circuit -- my apologies -- the Fourth Circuit was correct that the Secretary -- that the head of the Forest Service did not have authority to grant this pipeline right-of-way. So you would have to affirm on that basis.
My apologies for -- No, you were confusing me, so I -- I don't know that you have fully satisfied the parade of horribles that have been put forth. In my own judgment, the most serious one is the view that if everything the Park Department administers, the entire trail, that that means that it can stop pipelines or other things across the country, the -- the 200,000 or whatever miles that this is. And I -- I don't know that you have actually articulated concisely a -- a response to why that parade of horribles is not likely. I can -- I can give you -- I don't think it's enough to say that they haven't done it. I can give you a very concrete example.
In the past 50 years, since the Trails Act was passed, there has not been a single new pipeline right-of-way through federal lands under the Appalachian Trail. There have been a number on state, local, and private lands, and the same would apply to other trails.
Now, they acknowledge, for example, that the Blue Ridge Parkway is land in the Park System.
They acknowledge that wild and scenic rivers are land in the Park System. So the same principle that they would block pipelines would apply to them as well. And there is no reason why a parkway constitutes land but a trail does not or why a wild and scenic river would constitute lands and a trail not. Congress even provided ways in which you could move the trail under certain provisions by acquiring new land on which to run the trail.
It did the same thing with the Blue Ridge Parkway. Why would Congress allow pipeline under the Blue Ridge Parkway but not under the trail when those two run parallel to each other and are very close in some spots? That's actually a highly disputed point, whether they have allowed a pipeline under the Appalachian Trail -- under the Blue Ridge Parkway.
460(a)(3), the provision at issue there, is entitled Licensor Permits to Owners of Adjacent Lands. So the one question is, well, is a right-of-way to a pipeline to an owner of an adjacent land, but otherwise it says that it has to be non-consistent with use of such lands for pipeline purposes. So -- For -- for pipeline purposes? For pipe -- for parkway purposes. Parkway purposes. And what you look for in the parkway is the Park Service regulations governing the parkway.
What you look for for the national -- for the Appalachian Trail is the Park Service regulations governing the trail, which specifically cover the kinds of rights-of-ways and pipelines, et cetera, that can pass over -- Well, if -- -- or under the trail. If the statutes allow it to go under the parkway, is there any reason why Congress would say: Well, you can go this far, but you can't go another thousand feet in some spots and go under the trail? Because they wanted to keep the Appalachian Trail, insofar as it's on federal land, where the most beautiful parts of the Appalachian Trail are to be found, through the national forest, through the -- through the Park System, Congress drew a bright line. Well, I mean, that gets to the fundamental question I have about your argument. There may be all sorts of very good environmental reasons why this pipeline shouldn't be built.
And those, I take it, are involved in the other issues in the case, but do you have more than a ""gotcha"" argument? Do you -- I mean, and -- and sometimes they work, but if you fit these statutes together, this is what they say, and you can't get out of it, but do you really have an argument that this is what Congress intended when it adopted the statutes on which you rely? I think we do.
We know, for example, that they had the General Authorities Act before them when they passed the Mineral Leasing Act and created an exception for lands in the Park System from -- from the pipeline authority that they were granting in that Act. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang, two minutes remaining. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you. The statutory regulation of in-holdings was addressed in Sturgeon, Section 10751.
Counsel has not suggested that that broad authority does not apply.
This strikes close to home.
The Potomac Heritage Scenic Trail runs straight through Alexandria. Counsel suggests that such regulation of lands in the National Park System is limited to purposes of the trail.
I would not feel comfortable as a municipal officer given that's the case. And, moreover, that threatens the cooperative management system whereby municipalities have allowed the trail for 50 years, and then going fact -- going back to the 1920s and '30s to cross their lands without necessarily having easements for the trail. Two, land as a property right going down to the earth, that is a very odd fit for this trail that runs across the surface and that can change locations. Three, Congress in Section 1246(a)(1)(A) specifically says the Interior has overall administration of the trail, but then says there's no transfer of management responsibilities for federally-administered lands.
That's the antithesis of the clarity that Congress acts with when it wants to transfer -- Excuse me, Mr. Yang -- -- its exertion of land -- -- that's the problem, which is read that definition. Management and administration have two different meanings.
It says we don't transfer management when -- I get the point.
But the problem is -- That's the problem. -- Petitioner -- the first sentence says: ""Overall administration is administration and management of the trail."" If Petitioner is right that the trail is land, that includes management of the land. But that makes a hash of the second sentence, which says, ""no authority over the land management is transferred."" So Petitioner also -- or Respondent has a problem with Sections 1246(e) and (h)(1), both of which apply only outside the boundaries of federally-administered land, (h)(1) where the trail is outside, and (e) where the right-of-way is outside. There is no such thing under Respondent's theory because the right-of-way and the trail is federally-administered land.
The overall administration -- this is the position of the agencies for 50 years -- that overall administration is spelled out in the Act.
It's a continuous route. You select the right-of-way and then you relocate it.
That's in A(2) and (b).
A uniform marker.
You're a backstop for state and local governments acquiring the required right-of-way. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Mr. Chief. The case is submitted.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-67, United States versus Sineneng-Smith. Mr. Feigin. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent acknowledges that in the context of a criminal law, the terms ""encourage"" and ""induce"" can refer solely to acts that facilitate or solicit unlawful activity.
That's the meaning that they have in the context of this criminal law. There's no reason to reach out and give them a vastly more expansive interpretation simply to strike the statute down.
Prohibitions on facilitating or soliciting unlawful activity have existed since before the founding and are perfectly constitutional. Interpreting this law to be unconstitutionally overbroad would deviate from that tradition and directly contradict the canon of constitutional avoidance. Historical understanding and practice confirm that Congress didn't use these familiar criminal law terms to enact a novel and broad ban on speech.
Predecessors to this statute have been on the books since the late 19th Century, and this provision has existed in substantially its current form for decades. Yet, Respondent and her amici have identified no actual instances in which the statute has been applied to protected First Amendment activity or any concrete documented instances of chilling speech. The absence of such evidence isn't just happenstance, and it doesn't just reflect long-standing executive self-restraint.
It's because the statute isn't aimed at speech, and it certainly doesn't encompass substantial amounts of it. To the extent that it could be applied to protected speech, that can be handled through the normal mechanism of as-applied First Amendment challenges in those cases.
This isn't such a case because Respondent's own activity of fraudulently inducing aliens to pay her for a false path to lawful permanent residence isn't protected by the First Amendment, and she is not entitled to the last resort remedy of overbreadth invalidation that the Ninth Circuit on its own initiative reached out to impose. That's particularly so because she was convicted of an offense that required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she acted for the purpose of financial gain.
Yet, she -- You -- you would acknowledge, though, that there are situations in which this would be unconstitutional as applied? Your Honor, I -- I suppose there might be some circumstances where this could be unconstitutional as -- as applied. I don't know that anyone's identified any actual such applications that the statute would reach -- Well, let's suppose -- -- under our reading. -- you know, a grandmother whose granddaughter is in the United States illegally, tells the granddaughter, you know, I hope you will stay because, you know, I will miss you, things will not get better if you go back, so I encourage you to stay.
That -- Well -- -- that -- that would be illegal under the statute, right? -- it would not be illegal under the statute, Your Honor, and here's why: First of all, the issue of when verbal acts or other acts cross the line into criminal complicity or solicitation is not a -- an issue the second problem with constitutional avoidance is the discussion that we've been having this morning, which is it doesn't actually avoid the problem because, if all you're doing is change the verb from encourage and induce to solicit, you are simply creating a brand-new First Amendment exclusion by creating a statute that prohibits encouraging or soliciting non-criminal conduct, which we've never seen a single statute like that before -- Mister -- -- as the point that -- Go ahead. Well, Mr. Fleming, could I take you back to the question I asked before, when you gave me the answer that Coates is a case that falls within the category that I mentioned, and you said we didn't know what Coates was doing, but, actually, the opinion says Coates was a student involved in a demonstration and the other appellants were pickets involved in a labor dispute. That is expressive conduct at the very least.
So I -- I ask you again, do you have a case in which a person who did not engage in speech is able to make a free speech overbreadth argument? I -- I -- I mean, Coates may have been involved, but I'm not sure what the Court knew in that event.
I think there's a footnote in the opinion that says it's not clear exactly what he was doing.
He was part of the group.
So I think that's the best example. That said, the -- one of the cornerstones of the overbreadth doctrine is that as long as you are charged under the provision, which my client clearly was, and she herself, by the way -- the indicted conduct was the sending of a retainer in which she agreed to file non-fraudulent applications with the government. There's no suggestion that anything she did was actually fraudulent in terms of what she was indicted for for these counts.
The mail fraud counts had to do with oral statements made earlier. So there was, in fact, an as-applied free speech argument made.
It wasn't decided by the Ninth Circuit.
It's not covered by the question presented.
But she did engage in speech.
That's our position. But it doesn't matter for purposes of the question before the Court because this is an overbreadth challenge against the sweep of this statute far beyond any legitimate conduct that the government would need to prohibit because there are many other statutes that prohibit actual conduct-based wrongdoing. Unless -- if I may, I'd just like to point out this is a very unusual statute. If Congress wrote a statute that said it is a crime to aid, abet, or solicit certain serious civil offenses, A, B, C, is that law on its face permissible? I would say not without some proof, because, if we take Stevens seriously, as I think we have to, there would have to be some kind of evidence that the framers, at the time that they wrote the First Amendment, expected that category of speech to be excluded from its ambit. If Congress had rewrote it to say it is a crime to aid or abet or solicit certain offenses and then lists -- and makes them crimes, you're okay with that, obviously? I mean, that raises -- that's a harder case.
Thankfully, we don't have to deal with that here.
That raises, I think, the difficult question, which Mr. Feigin I think very wisely stayed away from, which is it's hard to tell sometimes the line between protected speech and unprotected solicitation. Remember, in Williams, this Court said it's perfectly okay to say to someone, I -- I encourage you to obtain child pornography. That's protected.
So is it enough? I mean, solicitation of violent offenses, we know that that -- that can be prohibited.
Solicitation of minor offenses, I think that's a difficult question.
This Court doesn't have a lot of solicitation cases on the books.
Maybe one day Your Honors will have to decide it, but that is not today. So I would just like to be very clear. This is a statute that uses very broad words. It uses them in the context in which all they can do is ban free speech.
The result is that vast amounts of truthful and accurate and heartfelt speech that's in no way related and much less integral to any actual crime is subject to five years in federal prison. I would submit that the First Amendment is wisely designed to protect us from just this kind of a law, and we would respectfully request that the judgment be affirmed. Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Feigin. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I take Respondent's principal submission today to be that you simply can't read these words to mean anything other than the incredibly broad reading that Respondent in the Ninth Circuit attribute to them and that's why you can't do constitutional avoidance, but that's simply not true. As Respondent acknowledges on pages 20 to 21 of her brief, these words can, in the context of a criminal complicity provision, at least under the canon of noscitur sociis, have the meaning that we are attributing to them today.
And if they can have that meaning in that context, they can have that meaning in this context. These are not unusual or strange words to use in this context to mean what we are saying that they mean.
As we point out in our brief, they are commonly used in state statutes, the Model Penal Code, the LaFave treatise, even decisions of this Court have used them in that way. Used in that way, they fill a gap in this statute that includes conduct, for example, under clause 1, the alien -- someone needs to actually bring the alien into the United States, so even aiding and abetting, bringing into the United States, wouldn't cover certain kinds of help for aliens who come into the United States by themselves. Congress was using these words in their normal criminal law meaning because let's not forget, this statute, as I was discussing earlier with Justice Breyer, covers the facilitation, solicitation of a lot of actual criminal conduct, coming to and entering the United States unlawfully. To the extent that it also covers certain civil violations, for reasons I've discussed, I think this Court has recognized in previous cases like Pittsburgh Press and Gazzam and in the white-applicants-only example that Congress or another legislature can civilly proscribe speech that facilitates activities that are civilly prohibited. And if Congress -- and if that were really protected speech, Congress or another legislature couldn't even civilly proscribe it. The reason why it can be civilly proscribed is because it is unprotected speech. And if it's unprotected speech, then it can be subject to a criminal prohibition as well. This -- to the extent that this statute may reach some protected speech, it can be handled as applied.
There is no reason to read this statute as broadly as Respondent is contending that it needs to be read here and that the Ninth Circuit read it for the very first time -- Mr. Feigin -- -- in this case. -- what in reading this statute would give an average person notice of all of the limitations you're suggesting to us? Because I read ""encourage or induce an alien to come, enter, or reside in the U.S., knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law,"" seems to me that all of the examples that were raised earlier, the hospital that's treating a child with -- an illegally present child with a disease, the church who provides worship to illegal aliens, all of the other examples that were given on their face to the common reader of those words would be a violation of the statute. Well, Your Honor, I don't think that is the standard -- I don't think that's the standard this Court applies that someone is ignorant of what those words mean in the context of the criminal law. Again, these are not -- these are not words that are unique to this statute.
If you look at the LaFave treatise, Section 13.2, the word ""encouraging"" is used as the title of section headings to describe accomplice liability.
This Court used the word -- But accomplice liability -- -- ""induce"" in Williams. -- has all sorts of meaning that you're not endorsing.
You're saying this is not aiding and abetting.
You're saying it's not solicitation.
It's something else -- No, Your Honor -- -- altogether? -- we are using the principles of complicity and solicitation in a statute that is directed at large amounts of criminal activity to inform what these words mean here. I -- I suppose it is possible that someone who does not have any knowledge of how those words are used in the context of facilitation or solicitation statutes might look at it and might have the reaction that they should be given a different meaning, but I don't think that's the standard this Court should apply.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
