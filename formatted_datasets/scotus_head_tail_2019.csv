"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-877, Allen versus Cooper. Mr. Shaffer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When states infringe the exclusive federal rights that Congress is charged with securing, Congress can make states pay for doing so.
That's our respectful submission today, one that follows from the Constitution's text and affords ample basis for this Court to uphold the work Congress did in enacting the CRCA. Article I, Section 8, clause 8, what we're calling the intellectual property clause, is unique within Article I in laying down an express constitutional mandate for Congress to protect specified private property rights against any and all intrusion. Consider just how pointed and clear the constitutional text is.
Congress is not only to be granting copyrights but securing them, the request for injunctive relief.
And that's how it goes in copyright cases. Now, as to the notion that there could be individual suits against individual officers under 1983, you're exactly right, Chief Justice, qualified immunity is a defense in this context. I'd commend to the Court the Fourth Circuit's decision on this point.
It's at 37a, 39a.
They basically said, because there's some defense that's available to these officials, they say they read the settlement agreement differently, maybe they didn't know it was copyright infringement, maybe they weren't looking for the watermarks or the -- the time stamps, that is a good enough defense.
Qualified immunity gets them out of the case, and those claims, too, were dismissed. That's why it's so important, part of why it's so important, in copyright cases that there be secure remedies for copyright holders. That's true against states and it's true against anyone.
Most copyright holders, unlike patent holders, Justice Alito, these are small fish, they have not sunk costs into this sort of a registration. And they need to have secure statutory damages and attorneys' fees in order to come to court at all because, in copyright cases, as Congress found from the testimony before it and the -- and the submissions of the register, you need to have statutory damages.
Otherwise, how can you quantify what the harm was? And especially given how small the stakes are in copyright cases and how under-heeled most copyright plaintiffs are, if you don't have those statutory damages, you don't have a right.
And that is specifically found by Congress in the House report at pages 9 and 10. So, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked about what happens in ordinary cases.
This is exactly what Congress looked at.
They said the rule in copyright cases, absent the CRCA, is that copyright infringement pays for states.
They will get away with it every time.
You will not have copyright holders who have incentives and means and attorneys to bring suit.
That should not be the outcome in this case. And to say it, respectfully, that it's incumbent upon every copyright plaintiff who sues a state to prove a constitutional violation and willfulness in the way that Mr. Park articulates is to render the right nugatory and the CRCA as well. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1498, Atlantic Richfield versus Christian. Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves whether the hundreds of thousands of landowners on Superfund sites can bring state lawsuits to implement their own piecemeal hazardous waste cleanups. The answer should be no. CERCLA entrusts EPA to protect human health and the environment by developing a remedial plan that protects the whole community. Respondents are profoundly wrong that removing waste is always better than leaving it in place. Superfund sites contain extremely hazardous substances, lead, mercury, plutonium, to name a few.
Excavation, transportation, and disposal of these substances is risky not only to neighbors but the millions of people who live next door to Superfund sites.
Whether these risks hook. But the real question is one of status.
And it's -- Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, you were wrong on this as being a question of who has to sue and a burden.
EPA would have no way of knowing what -- they only know in this case and wrote them a letter because there's a lawsuit and a Supreme Court case in the state of Montana, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who live on -- live on Superfund sites with uranium and God knows what else, and how is EPA exactly supposed to know when someone is removing uranium? It has a half-life of 4.7 billion years. Arsenic has no half-life.
It always is there.
It cannot be destroyed.
It doesn't evaporate.
So, yeah, they have some restrictions before they move hazardous waste. The other thing is in terms of who you'd have to sue, I would freak out if I got a -- a -- a letter.
Their view is you have to sue these poor innocent landowners and say you're liable under CERCLA.
Just so you know, that's the only way we can keep control of the site. That's the only way we're going to know and then, you know, now they're on notice because, otherwise, you would have this metaphysical thing of who knows who's liable? In terms of the taking issue, and I think that Justice -- I mean, you guys already answered this, but this is really a question of do you have to go to EPA.
If EPA denies permission and they want to bring a takings claim, go sue EPA. There's also a citizen suit provision that in 2025, they can bring a lawsuit and say: EPA, your remedy was terrible, we don't like it, it violated CERCLA, come up with a new one. That -- that's what the citizen suit provision is before -- for. On the mouse hole point, I don't think it's a mouse hole.
So it has mouses or elephants, I guess, all the way in the statute. There are provision after provision in the contiguous landowner, in the demicrominimus -- or whatever that word is -- in the bona fide landowner that says at all times you have to make sure you don't interfere with EPA's remedy. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-882, Babb versus Wilkie. Mr. Martinez. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 633a states that all federal personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.
Both parties agree that that language tracks the text and meaning of Title VII's identical federal sector provision covering race, sex, and religion. Together the two provisions bar discrimination not only in the ultimate outcome of a personnel decision but also in the process of making that decision.
That's true regardless of whether the prohibited characteristic at issue is a but-for cause of the final decision. That's the rule that the MSPB and the EEOC have applied in countless cases for many years, but more importantly it flows directly from that this provision is not enforceable and that's the rule that courts across the country have applied. The Solicitor General has had months to come up with a solution to this hypothetical, and the best the Solicitor General can do is come up with a statutory provision that's unenforceable. That puts victims of discrimination in exactly the same position they were in before this statute was enacted, where they had remedies that were not enforceable.
Congress stepped in here.
It passed a broad statute because it wanted to protect these people. Your Honor, I leave you with the statutory text which says very clearly that all federal personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.
A decision that's made by applying a younger-is-better policy, contrary to the Solicitor General, is not made free from any discrimination based on age. You know, I -- I assume, and I hope, that we would not see within any federal agency any sort of policy like younger is -- is better.
And so I'm not sure what practical benefit you are going to provide for in the typical individual age discrimination employment case if you say that the person can't get reinstatement or whatever, absent but-for causation, but there are going to be these other equitable remedies available.
I don't know what kind of injunction would be available -- would be of practical benefit in a case like that. May -- if I may answer? Two quick points, Your Honor.
First of all, I think -- I agree with you, we would not like to see agencies doing these sorts of things.
If you look at the Brenton case that we cite at pages 41 to 42 of our brief, that case involved a -- a written memorandum.
The policy said that someone's ability to control traffic declines with age, and they were treating applicants for those positions badly for that reason. I think -- more broadly, Your Honor, I think the injunctive relief and the prospective remedies that are available are extremely important in -- in the real world, which is precisely why, in the equal protection context, you've recognized the importance of that kind of injunctive relief, and we think that relief is just as important here.
We ask you reverse. Thank you, counsel, General. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-6943, Banister versus Davis. Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed for either of two independent reasons. First, a Rule 59(e) motion filed within 20 days of judgment is part of the first full opportunity to pursue habeas relief.
It is not a second habeas application. In the 50 years between Rule 59's adoption and AEDPA's enactment, there is no record of a court ever treating a timely Rule 59 motion merely seeking reconsideration as though it were a second habeas application.
AEDPA did not change this settled practice, and nothing in this Court's Gonzalez decision suggests otherwise. Rule 60(b) motions present obvious opportunities to circumvent AEDPA's restrictions, as the facts be an attack on the integrity of the judicial proceeding, which is distinct in their view from arguing, district court, you got it wrong. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit takes the view that alleging a conflict of interest by habeas counsel would be attack on the integrity of the proceeding, even though this Court recognized in Gonzalez that merely arguing that appellate -- that habeas counsel missed an issue or failed to develop it would not be something that goes to the integrity of the proceeding. The point is not whether the Fifth Circuit is right or wrong about those classifications but that there are boundary cases and that it can be difficult.
And to require a Fifth -- a district court to make those threshold determinations and then potentially to have a court of appeals make a different determination about it is going to be much less efficient, is going to create real uncertainty about rules that are supposed to be clear and -- and -- and are linked to the time to appeal. The last point I'd like to make is with regard to Rule 4(a) and to Texas's argument about that.
Their argument, as I understand it, relies on examples that exclusively involve instances that are not seeking genuine Rule 59(e) relief and you need to look beyond the pleading to that -- to at least that extent. Well, that requirement comes right in the text of the rule itself.
It has to be a motion under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment.
If you title something Rule 59(e) and then you ask for attorneys' fees or you title it Rule 59(e) and say I want an extension, but you don't actually ask to alter or amend the judgment, it doesn't satisfy the plain text of the rule. But Texas has expressly conceded -- this is at page 44 of their brief -- that Mr. Banister did file a true Rule 59(e) motion. They just think it should be subject to Section 2244(b).
But, even if it is, that doesn't mean that the motion wasn't filed, that it was a true Rule 59(e) motion seeking that relief, and that is all that Rule 4(a) requires. If the Court has no further questions, we ask you to reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-631, William Barr, Attorney General versus the American Association of Political Consultants. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to turn their cell phones off. Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1991, Congress enacted the TCPA's basic restriction on the placement of automated calls to cell phones.
In the years that followed, lower courts consistently upheld the constitutionality of that provision as a content-neutral restriction on the use of calling technologies that consumers found particularly intrusive and annoying. Congress's enactment of the government-debt exception in 2015 did not introduce any constitutional infirmity into the statutory scheme.
That exception is limited to a narrow category of calls that intrude less severely on consumer privacy it. And that's contrary to the -- the usual understanding that the First Amendment exists to foster speech.
It's contrary to the Court's reference in Reed to laws that target speech because of its communicative content. Why would the Court review more skeptically the law that looked at the same basis as a rationale for exempting speech rather than to regulate? The second thing is Mr. Martinez said many times that Congress and the FCC have exempted non-commercial calls from the automated-call restriction.
And I think that really overlooks the respective responsibilities of Congress and the FCC. Congress has broadly regulated at least calls using a pre-recorded voice or an artificial voice to residential landlines just as it has calls to cell phones.
Both of the underlying bans encompass non-commercial calls. Congress has vested the FCC with broad, though not identical, authority to exempt particular categories of calls from the residential and the cell phone ban respectively, and you can look at page 5A and 6A of the appendix to the government's merits brief to see that the -- the exemption authority is -- is basically comparable. The discrepancy under current law results from the fact that the FCC has exercised its exemption authority much more robustly with respect to residential landlines than it has with respect to cell phones.
That can't create a facial constitutional infirmity in the statute itself.
If people think that the FCC should adopt comparable exemptions for non-commercial calls to cell phones, they can file a petition to that effect. The -- the last thing I'd say in respect is -- goes to the colloquy between Mr. Martinez and Justice Kagan, where Mr. Martinez said, yes, if they had framed it not in terms of the content of the call but in terms of all calls from the holder of a government-backed debt to -- to the debtor that that would be subject to more relaxed scrutiny.
And that would simply be -- an approach that distinguished on that basis would simply encourage Congress to enact laws with more of a broad brush. It would discourage Congress from trying to fine-tune laws, and that discouragement would only be exacerbated if we took the Respondents' approach to severability striking down the whole law.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-725, Barton versus Barr. Mr. Unikowsky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question before the Court today is, what does it mean for an offense to render an alien inadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule? The Court should hold that an offense renders an alien inadmissible if the immigration judge finds that the offense renders the alien inadmissible at the removal hearing that precipitates the need to apply the stop-time rule. If the Court disagrees with that and agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that inadmissible is a status, it should hold that an alien acquires that status when the alien is capable of being charged with inadmissibility. In this case, neither condition is satisfied.
Petitioner was the surplusage on the government side is a -- is a lot more significant in the hope that the removal clause isn't there. It's not just a matter that there's surplusage.
I mean, surplusage is generally bad.
But I think here it's more than that.
You see the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" paired with each other.
And I think that just implies that Congress is thinking that those are the two things that can happen to you.
And if you're inadmissible, you fall in one bucket, and if you're removable, you're in another bucket. And we see all over the adjacent statutes this concept of inadmissibility and deportability together with an ""or"" in between.
And it's -- it's clear in all those contexts that that's why that's -- that's why they're there, because those are the -- the two true outcomes. So just in -- in the intro of the cancellation of removal statute, where it says the attorney general may cancel removal of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable. Clearly, the reason those two things are paired together is that those are the two things that can happen to you.
And so that's why they're both there. And the same in just the general statute governing removal procedures, 1229a, that says that the immigration judge shall decide the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien, it's clear why those two words are there with the ""or"" in between, because those are the two things that can happen. So you go to the stop-time rule, which, after all, is -- is just like a buried definitional provision in the cancellation of removal statute itself, and you have ""inadmissible"" or ""removable."" And the natural inference is that the reason those are there is that those are the two things that can happen. That fits our interpretation perfectly because, if you're found inadmissible, then you're in the admissible category.
And if you're found deportable, then you're in the deportable category, or removal category. Excuse me.
I think that's a lot more persuasive than this rather convoluted argument from the government which apparently the government didn't even think of until its brief in this case because it explicitly did -- did not make this argument in an en banc petition filed less than a year ago.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1618, Bostock versus Clayton County, and the consolidated case. Ms. Karlan. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII. The employer has, in the words of Section 703(a), discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing.
And that discrimination is because of sex, again in the words of Section 703(a), because the adverse employment action is based on the male employee's failure to conform to a particular expectation about how men should behave; namely, that men should be attracted only to women and not was a woman. Somebody who comes in and says I'm not going to tell you what my sex is, but, believe me, I was fired for my sexual orientation, that person will lose. Well, if that's the case, then I think your whole argument collapses because sexual orientation then is a different thing from sex. Of course it is.
No one has claimed that sexual orientation is the same thing as sex.
What we are saying is when somebody is fired who -- Well, let me amend it. Your argument is that sex -- discrimination based on sexual orientation necessarily entails discrimination based on sex. But if it's the case that there would be no liability in the situation where the decision maker has no knowledge of sex, then that can't possibly be true. If there was that case, it might be the rare case in which sexual orientation discrimination is not a subset of sex. But in the case where the person knows the sex of the person that they're firing or refusing to hire, and knows the sex of the people to whom that person is attracted, that is sex discrimination, pure and simple. And it's important to understand that -- and -- and this goes back to something that Justice Ginsburg asked during the opening argument, that discrimination against gay men and discrimination against lesbians is not one thing. And in 1964, if you look at the members of Congress's brief, they will tell you if you looked in the dictionary there was no phrase ""sexual orientation."" That is a modern way of combining two kinds of discrimination: Discrimination against gay men, which goes back to Leviticus and the common law, and discrimination against lesbians, which was not part of Leviticus and was not part of the common law. Indeed, in 1964, there were only 16 states in the United States that clearly forbid some act in which lesbians could engage. So the idea that this is one large idea about sexual orientation discrimination in the abstract, without reference to sex, simply burkes the history and burkes the understanding. And if you look at the harassment cases, you will see why this is true.
Gay men are harassed in a different way than lesbians. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 19-465, Chiafalo and others versus the State of Washington. Mr. Lessig. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court: The cases -- the question in these cases is straightforward: Do the states have the power to control through law how an elector may vote? They do not.
The ordinary expected meaning of the words of the Constitution, against the background of the framers' deliberation, make it clear that the states have no such power. But what is also clear is that Washington does not like the Constitution's design.
It asks this Court to read the word ""elector"" as agent or, maybe better, minion, and it declares that the votes electors cast are not, as the Constitution expressly describes them, their and to enforce that requirement. We ask you to reaffirm that principle today. Thank you. Thank you, General. Mr. Lessig, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Your -- Your Honors, the State has relied upon early statutes which it says affirm the power of the state to remove electors because they violate a condition.
Absolutely none of those statutes have anything to do with the conditions on voting. Those statutes related to the appointment power.
They were incidental to the appointment power.
So you can see obviously that, incidental to the appointment power, the State has the authority to make sure someone -- someone shows up to vote.
And we believe that general laws apply to electors as well.
This is not a general immunity.
But they have no power to control the vote and they never have exercised that. The State has asserted that because they appoint the electors, they get to control the electors.
But, in fact, the authority they rely on is quite explicit.
Myers, at page 119, says the reason for this is that those in charge of and responsible for administering functions of government need the authority to control them by removing them.
That was the reason for the principle. But there is nothing in the founding to suggest that the framers imagined the states administering the Electoral College.
That's why the states don't appear in the Twelfth Amendment at all. And, finally, Your Honor, if you recognize this power, how do you cabin it? If you find the State has the power to regulate electoral votes, may the State forbid the elector from voting for a candidate who has not visited the state, who has not released his tax returns, as bills in New Jersey and New York purport to do, or has not pledged to appoint justices who will uphold Roe? Open this door and there are an endless list of partisan opportunisms that will tempt the states.
Throughout history, there have been amendments to change the elector discretion, every single time recognizing there was that discretion. For the State of Washington, in 1977, to discover it is to show they were chumps believing they didn't have this power.
And we believe the power has always been with electors to exercise discretion. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-565, CITGO Asphalt Refining Company versus Frescati Shipping Company. Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The basic issue in this case is what ought to be the default rule for what is the generally referred to as safe-port or safe-berth clause in the standard charter party form that has, frankly, governed the transportation of ocean-going vessels for a very, very long time. There are -- the court below concluded that -- based on the language referring specifically to ""staying afloat and safely,"" that this imposed a strict liability on the charterer, my client, who designated that Paulsboro, New Jersey, would be the port of entry for these particular goods. That is an extraordinary against all things that can happen. And I submit to you that if you're not the insurer against all bad things that happen, one of the bad things that you're not insuring against is the anchor in this particular case. It is not a characteristic of this port.
This Court specifically defined objects in the sea, submerged objects in the sea that are unknown and unknowable as perils of the sea, not as characteristics of the port. The Court's already been down this road.
It ought to follow that same position that it took in G.R. Booth. And then finally, with respect to Gilmore and Black, what they say is the text is being way over-read by the prior decisions. All of those decisions ignore this Court's statement in Atkins that this cannot fairly be immediately assumed to operate as a warranty. And, finally, what they said as a matter of both policy and maritime commerce concerns is that the charterer is in the least effective position to prevent the prob -- the -- the injuries that will arise under these circumstances. And it makes no sense to put it on the backs of the party least capable of dealing with the problem because it creates insurance risks, it imposes unlimited potential liability, which this Court has consistently recognized. I'm not saying that this all should fall on -- on Mr. Goldstein's client.
Mr. Goldstein, if determined today, if this Court were to decide today that there's no liability for CITGO, he can go back to -- to the federal government and seek complete exoneration because the third-party here, the person who left the anchor in that -- in that waterway, didn't identify it, didn't tell anybody about it, that's the person who should be liable. We can't find that person.
There are two ways to deal with that.
There's exoneration for him completely because of that third-party, and there's the oil spill fund which would take care of it. My client's already spent more than $100 million on that fund.
It should not be -- it is not an equitable result to impose another $140 million solely on the party least capable of avoiding this particular problem. If there are no other questions, I would urge you to reverse, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-518, the Colorado Department of State versus Micheal Baca.
I note at the outset that Justice Sotomayor is recused in this case. General Weiser. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution authorizes states to use their plenary authority to remove a bribed elector, one who engages in a rebellion, or one who would perpetrate a bait and switch on the people of their state by voting contrary to a binding pledge.
By contrast, if a state wishes to treat electors as free agents, rather than as proxy voters, it is free to do so. In short, states determine how to select electors and ensure that they meet the relevant requirements and perform their duties as assigned.
This means, the Court should keep faith with the system, keep faith with the Constitution until amended and maintain indirect election, acknowledging that both sides here, both sides have a vision of presidential selection that is imperfect, but the various checks, balances, and separations that our Constitution's drafters and amenders have put into the Constitution, all of those should be given a role in our constitutional universe. And, Your Honors, I -- I think that all adds up to elector discretion. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel. General Weiser, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me make three points in response and offer two closing thoughts. First off, on standing, the payment or non-payment of the per diem fee was never before alleged, and any reported non-payment is not in the record. Second, on nominal damages, prior cases like Smith and Bird did not accord standing on nominal damages alone, instead focusing on whether there's an actual personal injury. Second, as to Justice Scalia's important point about congressional remover -- removal in the case of bribery, it's worth noting there is a prescribed removal process for senators, as Justice Alito noted.
In the case of electors, there's no such process, which means this Court's default rule controls.
The power to remove is thus incident to the power to appoint. Third, it's worth noting this is the first time we've seen an elector who violated a state binding law.
Up until now, including the 2016 election, we've always seen Congress defer and count votes as transmitted by the states. Two closing thoughts.
During the course of this entire litigation and this argument today, my friends on the other side have failed to offer any viable theory on how to address the spectacle of a bribed elector, an elector who votes for Frodo Baggins, or one who would perpetrate a bait and switch on the people of our state.
Colorado's pledge requirement addresses all such harms. After over 230 years of constitutional tradition, my friends on the other side would toss out our nation's state-centered model of electoral accountability in favor of a treacherous experiment.
We urge this Court to reject this dangerous time bomb and avoid a potential constitutional crisis by reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1171, Comcast Corporation versus the National Association of African American-Owned Media. Mr. Estrada. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held in this case that a plaintiff may succeed on a Section 1981 claim merely by showing that race was a factor that was considered in the defendant's decision-making, even if the decision would have made and was made for entirely appropriate business reasons having nothing to do with race. Solely on this basis, the Ninth Circuit saved the Plaintiff's third complaint from dismissal.
We submit that this decision is wrong and should be reversed for at least three reasons. The first is that it is contrary to this Court's decisions, such as Gross and Nassar, signatories are named.
They are the NAACP, the Urban League, and Al Sharpton. And so the allegation is that we paid off the oldest civil rights organizations in the court -- in the country to give us cover for race discrimination. The complaint goes on in paragraph 73 and 81 to say that we have minority-owned networks that are run by Magic Johnson and Diddy Combs, which apparently are some sort of artists, and it claims that these African American entertainers actually signed up with Comcast to give us cover for our racial discrimination. Now the period covered by the complaint is 2005 to February 2015, when the complaint was filed. So, in a nutshell, the theory of the complaint is that Comcast engaged in a racist plot with the Obama Administration, the oldest civil rights -- with the oldest civil rights organizations in the country, Diddy, and Magic Johnson. And that -- if that actually in any planet satisfies, I don't know how many paragraphs this has, Justice Kavanaugh, it -- it can have 100 paragraphs, but if in any planet that satisfies the plausibility standard on Iqbal, the civil justice system has real problems. If I could go back to the question that Justice Alito asked earlier with respect to the allegations that are listed in those pages, you know, the thing that I wanted to make clear with respect to the settlement and that I was making clear with respect to the time period covered by the complaint, which is 2008 to February 2015, is that the carriage by AT&T and DirecTV, which are probably the largest in the country, 25 million or so, is -- post-dates the events in the complaint. And so that the allegations in the current operative complaint with respect to demand that they can show by reference to this carriage is one that was by dint of a settlement that was entered during the pendency of this litigation. We ask for judicial notice, again, of the fact that these complaints were all pending in the Central District of California, and this probably had some bearing on the fact that Judge Hatter, who didn't just fall off the turnip truck, granted our motion to dismiss.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-260, the County of Maui versus the Hawaii Wildlife Fund. Mr. Lin. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not about whether the releases from Maui's underground injection wells should be regulated at all but how.
They are already regulated under several existing state and federal environmental programs, including the Clean Water Act's nonpoint source program. But is a Clean Water Act point source permit also required? The question is where the line falls between the Clean Water Act's federal point source program and its state law nonpoint source program. And the answer is in the text.
The text defines a point source as a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, and it thereby makes clear that the I -- I -- I think, if I can take issue with the -- the -- the premise there, which is that there's something that's being gotten away with here, the -- If they followed -- -- these wells were -- -- all the laws, and they still are polluting, they're getting away with it.
So something failed. Your -- The preventive measures of this law were not followed and something failed. Your Honor, the -- the whole -- even under NPDES permits, point source discharges can include pollutants that are below effluent limits. So I think the -- the mere fact that there are -- are nutrients that are getting into the ocean doesn't mean that the system has failed. And I think it comes back to the fact that, in this particular circumstance, these wells were constructed with encouragement and funding from EPA as a more environmentally protective solution than simply constructing an outfall pipe to the ocean. If I can come back to the traceability point, I think it's also important to note, my friend runs very far away from the septic tank examples, and, Justice Kagan, to answer your question about traceability, there are 7,000 cesspools within 750 feet of the ocean in Hawaii, and we cite to a study in our reply brief that showed that through a tracer, dye tracer study, not dissimilar from what was used here, it was established that pollutants from individual septic tanks were getting to the ocean within three hours to five days. So traceability can be done.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-587, the Department of Homeland Security versus Regents of the University of California, and the related cases. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2017, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA and the expansion of DACA were likely unlawful, a judgment this Court affirmed by an equally divided Court.
In the face of those decisions, the Department of Homeland Security reasonably determined that it no longer wished to retain the DACA policy based on its belief that the policy was illegal, its serious doubts about its illegality, and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies. That decision did not violate the APA for two reasons.
First, it's not subject to judicial review.
The rescission simply ended a previous where the Secretary weighs the -- the -- the -- the reliance interests against the reasons in her memo, everything's wrapped up.
And we really don't know how she would have conducted that balance, how she would have weighed those two, if the legal had been taken away from it. I -- I simply disagree with that.
When she specifically says that she's setting forth separate -- separate and independent grounds justifying the rescission, I don't think that there's any fair way to read that but by saying that she would have rescinded it based on any of the independent grounds, which brings me -- Look at the independent grounds.
Number one -- number one, ""we should not adopt a policy of non-enforcement of those laws for broad classes and categories."" Okay.
And Congress she thinks agrees with us. Well, I don't know.
Maybe they do; maybe they don't.
But, aside from that, that -- that's a conclusion. Look at the second one: ""We should do it on a truly individualized case-by-case basis."" That's a conclusion.
That isn't a reason. And the third one is a reason.
The third one: ""It is important to project the message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear,"" et cetera, ""enforcement of immigration against all class"" -- that's an independent reason. With respect, may I finish? May I finish? Yes. I'm going to try to squeeze in two points in a single sentence. That's all right. Good luck.
I'm sorry. The first -- the -- the first point is that I very much disagree. All of those articulate the basic same policy rationale that this is a law enforcement agency. They are against general policies that actively facilitate violations of the law. And the last point I will make is, while we don't think you need to address the legality question if you agree with us on any of our other arguments, if you disagree with us on any of our other arguments, you absolutely must address the ultimate legality question because we simply cannot be forced to maintain a policy that this Court concludes that is illegal. So, if you decide to get there, then we do think that DACA is illegal and was justifiably -- was justifiably rescinded on that basis as well. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-161, the Department of Homeland Security versus Thuraissigiam. Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress established the expedited removal system in 1996 for aliens who arrive at our borders or enter illegally and have no entry documents.
Such aliens are clearly inadmissible and have no right to be in this country. Congress reasonably concluded that a full-blown removal hearing was not necessary to make that determination.
Congress was also concerned, however, for -- about the possibility for delay and abuse of the asylum system if every time such a clearly inadmissible alien sought asylum.
What it did then was to provide for a three-tiered administrative screening system to first determine whether the alien had a credible fear -- fear of never -- -- under -- -- has never -- -- under the habeas? This Court has never said that.
And, again, Munaf -- Mr. Kneedler? I'm sorry. Could you answer, Mr. Kneedler? Mr. Kneedler, let me finish my question. Yeah, sorry. We have the great writ.
It was there to ensure that the executive acts according to law.
What's left if you tell me that there are laws, but there's no judicial review of whether those laws are being followed or not? That's my question. And -- and -- and my answer is Munaf and -- and -- and the 100-year-old precedent that Munaf stood for, where a determination about whether somebody should return to another country because of conditions there is simply a -- It's not returning.
He was there.
The question was a legal one, which was whether or not he should be turned over by the American forces or not.
The court said, even if he should have been, we're not going to step in in this situation. But the -- but the court drew on the rule of non-inquiry, which applies in the extradition context, which is about sending someone out from the United States to another country. I want to make another point.
When Respondent talks about review for egregious errors, I think he's talking about bringing in stuff that is outside the administrative record and trying to demonstrate to the Court that if only the review -- the asylum officer or the IJ had looked at this, it would have reached a different conclusion. That is -- that goes far beyond even traditional administrative review.
But the administrative proceedings in this case, for example, the asylum officer's record are just notes.
They're not a verbatim transcript.
They are there to assist the immigration judge in this self-contained internal review of whether someone has made even the showing necessary for a threshold credible-fear screening. They are not designed for judicial review.
And the suggestion that there would be judicial review in habeas corpus, unprecedented under this Court's decisions or the common law, would -- would require effectively to change the administrative system as well, but Congress determined that the -- that the three-tier screening that it provided and limited judicial review is necessary, is essential to get control of the nation's borders.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1195, Espinoza versus the Montana Department of Revenue. Mr. Komer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case asks whether the Federal Constitution allows the wholesale exclusion of religious schools from scholarship programs.
It does not. Yet, Montana's Blaine Amendment requires that exclusion.
As a result, the Blaine Amendment discriminates against religious conduct, beliefs, and status in violation of the free-exercise clause under Trinity Lutheran. The Montana Supreme Court disagreed.
That court held that barring religious schools from the program did not violate the Federal Constitution.
This Court should reverse that judgment. Even Respondents now concede that excluding religious schools from the program is unconstitutional, but they argue that the court avoided this discrimination by invalidating the entire program.
This is wrong.
The only is crystal clear when you read it that that is what they are doing in this case. They focus on the religious affiliation or religious nature of the schools. They are not talking about what the schools do. They are talking about what the schools are. Second, Zelman has already answered the question about who this program is aiding. It's not aiding the schools.
It is aiding the parents. You have a choice to make about the parents here.
You can either view them as mere inconsequential conduits through which public funds flow to the religious schools they choose or you can regard them, as you did in Zelman, as free and independent decision-makers who are being given the power to choose a religious education or a secular education in private schools. We are not arguing that the state couldn't just fund public schools.
We are saying that when the legislature, when the state makes the decision to empower parents to exercise their right to choose and direct their children's education, that the state cannot distinguish between parents who want a religious education for their children and parents who want a secular private education for their parents. We are only in that area because the state legislature has made, like Montana did, the decision to open it up beyond the public schools.
We don't question that the public schools must be secular.
This Court recognized that in Schempp.
And, as a result, the public schools now must be secular. But at the time these provisions were passed, the public schools were not secular. It's almost -- That is why -- It's almost sort of a illusory state, isn't it? The legislatures can choose to give money or not.
If they choose, they have to do it this way. But the court system is out of it because it can't force the legislatures to act constitutionally under their own constitution. You may -- That's basically what you're saying, isn't it? You may answer briefly. And not fund. We're saying the legislature ab initio might be able to do more than what the court should have done here.
They should have answered the federal question.
They should have recognized that Trinity Lutheran is applicable.
They should have recognized they were applying Locke exactly the way Missouri tried to. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument today in Case 18-1334, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Aurelius Investment, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether members of the Financial Oversight Board are officers of the United States who must be selected in the manner that the Appointments Clause prescribes or whether they are instead territorial officers who do not have to be selected in that manner. The Constitution's text, structure, and history, and this Court's precedents all make clear that the proper focus in answering that question is the nature of the authority the Board exercises.
It comes down to whether Congress has vested the Board with the executive power of the national a different Board.
They're perfectly entitled to do that.
They've every right to do that. But that's what they want because they don't like the way this Board is working out the debt problems. And so what you can be sure of, if we're in the remedies phase and I hope that we are not, but what you can be sure of if we are is that they are going to fight ratification by the Board tooth and nail for years and years and do everything possible to keep this thing in a situation in which they -- they -- they have the hope to get a different Board that will accomplish their objectives. So that's what will happen if we go down that path.
And I would strongly urge the Court not to do that.
If you do reach the remedial issue, then I think the de facto officer doctrine, a perfectly reasonable judgment, but more fundamentally, there is no reason to reach the remedial issue -- Mr. -- Mr. Verrilli -- -- to support as -- -- let -- -- constitutional -- -- let's say it is your test.
But let's also say that the crux of this statute -- there are some other things in it, but the crux of the statute is that it sets up a scheme for restructuring the debt of a bankrupt territory and -- on -- with the backdrop that that could not have been done under pre-PROMESA federal law by local officials themselves.
Why is it primarily local? May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice? Yes. Two things.
First, you wouldn't think that the mayor of Detroit was converted into a federal official because he took Detroit into bankruptcy under Chapter 9. He's still exercising his local power.
Same with the Board. And, second, again, the question I think has to be whose interests is -- is the Board advancing in that process? It's the court, the Article III court, that engages in the broad adjustment of interests here to achieve a -- a nationwide result. The Board's job, as the statute expressly says, is to act on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico and the government of Puerto Rico as its representative.
It's an advocate for Puerto Rico, and that's why it's territorial authority.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1048, GE Energy Power Conversion France versus Outokumpu. Mr. Dvoretzky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If this case involved a domestic arbitration agreement, GE Energy could enforce it as long as it could satisfy domestic non-signatory enforcement doctrines like equitable estoppel.
The question here is whether the New York Convention prohibits that same result for international arbitration agreements.
It does not. The Convention is simply silent about enforcement by non-signatories.
That silence is consistent with the Convention's design, which sets a floor, not a ceiling, for enforcing arbitration agreements and awards.
The Convention says that states must do certain things to promote arbitration.
It doesn't say they can't to do more than the Convention requires. Moreover, Article II, the principal provision about arbitration Singapore, France, Switzerland and other case -- cases cited in the briefs. Justice Sotomayor, you were looking for a limiting principle.
I think there are limiting principles to equitable estoppel under domestic law but the Convention just doesn't speak to them. Third, Mr. Hacker argues that Congress in effect adopts -- I'm sorry? What are they? It would depend on the contours of state law, but presumably state law would not allow you to tag a random person on the street with no connection to the contract and say you're equitably estopped.
There has to be a factual basis for the estoppel.
And here there is for the reasons that we have been discussing. Mr. Hacker argues that Congress adopted the Convention as both a floor and a ceiling for U.S. law.
That's simply not what Congress did in Chapter 2. It created federal jurisdiction where the agreement falls under the Convention, and then under 9 U.S.C. 206, if you have an agreement that falls under the Convention, a federal court exercising its jurisdiction can compel arbitration. It would do so by looking to domestic principles about when enforcement is proper. So in terms of how this case can be resolved, there's -- the narrowest possible way, is to simply hold that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to -- to apply a signatory requirement, at Petition Appendix 15A to 16A, the Eleventh Circuit recounts the district court's finding that we were parties but says the reason we can't enforce is that we didn't actually sign. I think that's demonstrably wrong and the narrowest possible way is to send it back for that reason.
If the Court wants to provide additional guidance, there are two ways to do that, I think.
One is to hold that the Convention provides a floor, not a ceiling.
I think that that follows from the text of the Convention, and also from international understanding. The second? The second way to resolve it, as Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, the term parties in Article II(3) is undefined. Domestic law fills that gap, as it does for many other things under the Convention, terms like ""null and void,"" ""incapable of being performed."" Those are not defined by the Convention but the Convention looks to domestic law, as it does for parties. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1150, Georgia versus Public.Resource.Org, Inc. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eleventh Circuit held that annotations to Georgia's official code are categorically ineligible for copyright protection.
That holding conflicts with a straightforward application of the Copyright Act's text and this Court's precedents. Starting with the statute, Sections 101 and 103 of the Act expressly provide that annotations are copyrightable derivative works. Nothing in the Act supports stripping Georgia's annotations of copyright protection merely because they were prepared by a contractor on behalf of a state agency. Therefore, the crux of the parties' dispute is whether this Court's 19th-century precedents support a decision different from the one that would be reached by applying standard interpretive principles to the notes should be copyrightable, why the Dominiak case that my friend on the other side just was describing doesn't undermine our copyright claim. But I think the crucial point on this is that PRO copied the entirety of the OCGA, including the judicial decision summaries that I think are clearly copyrightable under Wheaton and Callaghan. So PRO has to run the table on all portions of the OCGA to get an affirmance here, and I just don't think that they can. The PRO's main argument seems to be that the fact that the OCGA is official means that it cannot be copyrightable.
And I just don't think that that's consistent with history or this Court's precedents. Again, going back to Wheaton and Callaghan, you had official court reporters holding copyright in annotations.
And given that those were government officials, I just don't think that it can make a difference here that the state is the one holding the copyright. I think that this case is the legislative analogue of Wheaton and Callaghan. But I think it's also important to look at the history of the Copyright Act.
So the Copyright Office in the 1959 study and 1961 report interpreted the 19th century precedents we're talking about here as holding that states could hold copyright in annotations by state government employees, and then Congress passed the modern Copyright Act without in any way overriding that understanding or expanding the government edicts doctrine. Under that understanding, we win here. And then the final point that I want to touch on is how affirming the decision below would be very disruptive for states.
So about a third of states have the same regime as Georgia. They claim copyright in annotations to an annotated official code by commercial publishers. So affirming the decision below would blow up those regimes. There are at least two additional states that claim copyright in annotations by state government employees and five other states where the commercial publisher holds the copyright in the annotated official code.
Those regimes would probably also fall if the court's decision below was affirmed. So I think that statutory text and precedent compel a decision for Georgia here. Any innovations on the government edicts doctrine should come from Congress, not the courts.
The Court should reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-776, Guerrero-Lasprilla versus Ovalles and Attorney General Barr. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section (2)(D) provides for review of questions of law decided by the Board of Immigration Appeals.
I'll start with where we and the government agree.
At minimum, courts may review whether the Board identified the proper legal standard.
The government agrees. For this review to be meaningful and not just a requirement of correct boilerplate, courts must determine whether the government used the proper standard.
Again, the government agrees.
Review extends to whether ""the Board actually used the wrong standard."" Despite acknowledging this, the government fails to distinguish how reviewing whether the Board actually used the correct standard is different than reviewing whether the Board correctly applied that when they don't have jurisdiction. The rule we've offered provides the Court a clear test. The government, by contrast, if we set aside its extreme position, the position that would be you look at the boilerplate only, there is no test the government has offered as to meaningfully distinguish between whether or not a standard was actually used and whether or not the standard was correctly applied. Because the courts need clarity, we think the rule that we offer is by far the most suitable and -- and appropriate rule that will allow courts to adjudicate these cases as they arise. Third and finally, if there is any doubt here, I think the presumption of judicial review is quite important.
This does bear not just on underlying congressional intent but core separation of powers principles. The view of, if there's going to be any delegation of lawmaking authority to the agencies, that certainly needs to be clearly stated by Congress.
So any doubt as to how the various statutory interpretation factors and the history in St. Cyr all apply, to the extent that that is a wash, we don't think it is, we think it strongly favors our position, but that would strongly favor applying the presumption and ultimately concluding that there is judicial review over the application of -- of lots of facts. So, ultimately, our rule is necessary to fulfill the promise of judicial review and the premise of judicial review that's undeniably created in the statutory text.
It's also required to be a fulsome response to St. Cyr, as the -- the cases in the wake of St. Cyr, as well as the pre-1789 cases that we identify in our briefs make clear.
There would be substantial Suspension Clause problems if the Court -- if Congress had not in the Real ID Act included the application of law to fact. But then, finally and ultimately, our rule is the one that is clear, that is manageable, that gives a workable test for the lower courts that will be applying this hundreds of times each year to know where jurisdiction starts and stops. And it's the one that's ultimately true to the presumption in favor of judicial review in the event of any ambiguity. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1678, Hernandez versus Mesa. Mr. Vladeck. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this case was first argued to this Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent and counsel for the United States were both asked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on U.S. soil when he was shot and killed by Respondent.
Both said yes. The question before this Court today is, therefore, whether a Bivens action is nevertheless foreclosed because, in this case, Sergio was standing a few feet to the Mexican side of the border at the time he was shot. For two reasons, we believe that it isn't.
First, the fortuity of where a victim is standing does not, in has long rejected the argument that there should be any context in which law enforcement officers, because of the frequency with which they interact with average individuals, because of the nature of their interactions, because of the powers they have to search, to seize, to arrest in this context, to use lethal force, did not justify absolute immunity and instead justified a more narrower, qualified kind of immunity for those most likely to come face-to-face with private citizens. Distilled to its simplest, the government's position in this case is that officers in what is self-described as the nation's largest law enforcement agency should have a functional absolute immunity at least where foreign nationals are concerned. And our submission is that that is not consistent with how this Court has always understood the relationship between causes of action and immunity defenses in this context. It is not required by any of this Court's Bivens decisions.
It does not abide by this Court's suggestion in Abbasi that there are strong reasons and powerful reasons to retain Bivens in this context. And it would eliminate the one deterrence that is meaningfully available to ensure that officers in the nation's largest law enforcement agency are complying with the law. Our rule is -- Before you finish -- -- not case-specific. -- before you finish, can you address one decision that the government seems to put a lot of stock -- stock in, and that is RJR -- RS -- what is it -- R -- is it RJR Nabisco? So, Justice Ginsburg, that goes again to the question of whether extraterritoriality is a special factor counseling hesitation.
And I want to be clear, we agree that there will be much harder cases, if, say, for example, Agent Mesa was miles into Mexico, somehow acting under legal authority. But RJR Nabisco reinforces, it does not distinguish Kiobel in its suggestion that the presumption against extraterritoriality -- Mr. Chief Justice -- can be displaced when the underlying conduct touches and concerns U.S. territory with sufficient force to displace the presumption. If ever there was a case, Your Honors, where the underlying conduct touched and concerned U.S. territory with sufficient force, it's when a U.S. law enforcement officer standing on U.S. soil uses lethal force.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-7739, Holguin-Hernandez versus United States. Ms. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 51 tells parties to criminal proceedings how to preserve claims of error for appeal.
A party does so by telling the court what action the party wants the court to take when a ruling is made or sought.
There's no need to tell the court twice. In every federal court of appeals except the Fifth Circuit, this rule means what it says in the context of sentencing proceedings.
Specifically, it means that a criminal defendant who argues for a particular sentence in district court preserves for appeal a challenge to a longer sentence. In the Fifth Circuit, however, a criminal defendant, like Petitioner here, must argue no need to frame objections in district court in terms -- in those terms. And, second, Rule 51 just says that parties are required to tell the court what action the party wants the court to take. This facts-and-circumstances argument is, as Justice Kagan remarked, outside the question presented.
But just to briefly say a few things, all we are asking this Court to do is to leave it to -- to lower courts to apply the same fair notice standard that they apply in other contexts in this context, and the grounds language that my friend is relying on is not found anywhere in Rule 51.
It is only -- Where do you disagree with the government? Where do you disagree with the government? The -- well, I think the government's position and our position is -- are very close.
I think -- Where is the window where it's not? Where we might disagree is about when arguments are preserved, when a district court has fair notice.
I think we both agree that the fair notice standard applies, but we might find more arguments -- that the district court had more -- had fair notice of more arguments than the -- than the government is willing to concede. So, for example, here, I think they -- they are not -- don't expressly address the public dangerousness argument that we raised below.
But that's an area where we disagree. But, as I was saying, in Rule 46, there is this grounds language.
It is not present in Rule 51, and Rule 51 postdates Rule 46.
So the rule enactors clearly knew how to require that if they wanted to.
But even if you think there is some sort of grounds requirement in Rule 51 that's sort of implied, all that means is that the party needs to preserve the legal grounds on which they are relying.
It does not mean they have to preserve every fact and circumstance.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1113(2) of ERISA requires that claims for breach of fiduciary duty be brought within three years of when the plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach.
In 2015, the Respondent, Sulyma, sued, claiming that his retirement plans imprudently overinvested in hedge funds and commodities.
But more than three years before that suit was filed, Sulyma received plan disclosures that apprised him of the precise investment allocations he later claimed were imprudent. The Ninth Circuit held that those disclosures would not trigger the three-year bar because Sulyma testified that he had not read them and Intel, therefore, had not established that he about whether every single one of the class members had this actual knowledge or not based on these kinds of circumstantial proof that we were talking about. Just think of what a catastrophe that's going to be in the class action context. So, in the unlikely event that this Court disagrees with our position on the merits, I would hope that there would be clarity here as to how this -- this reading will play out in a class action context, because that would be a staggering, enormous negative consequence. After all, it does put the cart before the horse because statute of limitations is a threshold defense.
And so the idea that you would do it in that manner I think is just -- I -- it's a catastrophic problem. And then, with respect to the discussion, the colloquy on willful blindness, I understand my friend's position that it's just a jury instruction that allows an inference of actual knowledge.
But, respectfully, I don't think that's the way this Court described it in the Global-Tech decision. The Court basically said, as I read Global-Tech, that -- that it's not -- that proof of willful blindness, proof of the circumstances that would allow you to establish willful blindness, is not proof of subjective awareness, but it's something that you might consider as being just as culpable or that -- or -- or that they, in effect, have actual knowledge but not that they actually have actual knowledge.
It's an imputation. I -- I just think that's as clear as can be from what this Court said in Global-Tech. And so I think the question here is whether in this very different context, where, you know, as I said, these actual knowledge standards come virtually exclusively from criminal enforcement proceedings where you're trying to measure the individual defendant's culpability. And, of course, there should be an inquiry in that situation into the specific state of mind of the defendant.
That's what the whole culpability inquiry is about. Here, you're talking about a statute of limitations.
And in particular -- if I might finish -- a statute of limitations that's designed this three-year period to protect the interests of defendants.
And so it's important to balance those interests when reading the statute. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1323, June Medical Services versus Russo, and the cross-petition, 18-1460, Russo versus June Medical Services. Ms. Rikelman. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about respect for the Court's precedent.
Just four years ago, the Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The Louisiana law at issue here, Act 620, is identical to the Texas law and was expressly modeled on it.
After a trial, the district court ruled Act 620 unconstitutional, finding no material differences between this case and Whole Woman's Health.
On burdens, it found that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions.
At the same time, it answer. Justice Ginsburg, I think that's difficult to square with the fact that Doe 5, who does not have an OB-GYN practice, got privileges at Touro.
I think Petitioners acknowledge that there are not explicit patient minimums.
They call them implicit. But the kinds of requirements that they are pointing to are the sorts of things that look like they would have precluded Doe 5 and didn't.
These ought to play themselves out in a post-enforcement context, not as here. Thank you, General. Thank you. Five minutes, Ms. Rikelman. Your Honor, the lack of benefits of these laws is not state-dependent. The medical consensus is clear that in no state do they serve health and safety benefits. And, in fact, even the federal government a few months ago removed an admitting privileges requirement from its regulations of surgery centers nationwide, finding that the requirement is medically unnecessary and imposes burdens. And as Justice Kagan asked, this Court rejected an alleged credentialing benefit in Whole Woman's Health.
And after holding a trial, the district court rejected that this law would serve a credentialing benefit in Louisiana. With respect to burdens, the district court found that this law would be extremely burdensome, more so than the Texas law in Whole Woman's Health.
And its finding that these physicians would not be able to get privileges is supported by at least four aspects of the record. The fact that they tried to get privileges at 15 hospitals over one-and-a-half years under the court's supervision; the fact that the state's expert conceded that outpatient physicians who don't have a hospital-based practice are unlikely to get privileges; the fact that abortion access was thrown into chaos when this law actually took effect; and the hospital bylaws themselves, which included a variety of criteria that these physicians could never meet, including residency requirements. And, finally, I'd like to point out that this is not, in fact, a pre-enforcement challenge.
The state has recognized that, including in its state papers before this Court. The district court allowed the law to take effect but enjoined its penalties and supervised the physicians' efforts to get privileges over a year and a half.
Again, the state has previously acknowledged that this is not a pre-enforcement challenge. If there are no further questions. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",1.0

But that's inconsistent with the historical record as you, yourself, understand it, which is that it was tied to mens rea, which is categorical, applies in every single case.
What -- what is wrong with that? Our position is that to the extent it was tied to mens rea, inherent in the notion of mens rea was the ability to choose between right and wrong. So that is very different.
That is very different than what Kansas has today, which has no inquiry into that. I mean, these 18th Century cases that talk about moral capability or lack thereof in mens rea in the same breadth are hard to understand, but you have to take into account -- may I finish my sentence -- Certainly. -- Mr. Chief Justice? (Laughter.) That you have to take into account that people -- that the 18th Century and early 19th Century understanding of how the human mind works was very different from what we have today.
There wasn't even any -- any such thing as psychiatry in 1791 and it was in its infancy in 1868.
Is that wrong? Mr. Chief Justice? You may. I want to answer this succinctly.
It's not about what mental illness was or wasn't.
It's about how we treated insane people, this narrow group of them.
I think everybody knows who they are when they are forced to decide it.
And it's about not punishing people who don't know right from wrong. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-834, Kansas versus Garcia. General Schmidt. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a typical and recent year, more than 15 million Americans became victims of identity theft.
One-third of those had their personal information misused in an employment or tax-related fraud setting. Many of those victims were left to untangle reputations, eligibilities, and other finances.
That is why Kansas, like every other state, makes identity theft a crime.
Our laws apply in all settings to all people, citizen and alien alike. Respondents were convicted because they stole other people's personal information with intent to defraud.
But, in Respondents' view, these state criminal laws that govern everybody else do not apply to them.
They argue that Congress has, in effect, granted them to the benefit question, which I think goes perhaps to -- I'm not sure if it goes to conflict or -- or field, I'm a little uncertain about that -- but on the benefit issue, I -- I -- I -- the -- the -- what we agree is off limits is the I-9 system. We aren't arguing that Kansas prosecuted these individuals because they were trying to commit fraud on the I-9 system.
We're arguing that they defrauded folks whose identities were stolen and that we used as evidence the W-4 and K-4 tax forms.
We didn't use the I-9 system. With respect to the notion that somehow preemption turns not on the intent of Congress but on the subjective intent of the offender, that turns preemption analysis on its head. And a hypothetical I think that illustrates that, imagine that let's say Mr. Garcia on the facts here were stopped for speeding not because he was headed to a job he already had but because he was headed with completed employment forms, applications in the back of his car, to apply for the job. He still would be guilty of the same state law crimes of identity theft.
His intent was to obtain the benefit of employment.
But he never arrived at the employer to apply for the job in the first place.
That can't be the test that makes the difference here. And, finally, with respect to the -- the notion of what the state is asking for here, we're -- we're a little unclear on exactly what field our friends on the other side think is preempted. As I suggested earlier, if there is one, it has to be extremely narrow, the I-9 system itself, but we're not sure a field exists there because of the decision in Whiting that states may compel the use of the E-Verify system, which certainly is part of work authorization. So this Court has never identified a field and should not with respect to this case. The conflict, we don't see.
The conflict that was present in Arizona, as we discussed earlier, is not present here.
This is a fundamentally different case. Kansas is not trying to act as an immigration enforcer but to enforce our generally applicable identity theft laws. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-556, Kansas versus Glover. General Crouse. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Reasonable suspicion is a minimal standard.
It permits a brief investigation upon an officer's objective and particularized suspicion.
Common-sense judgments and inferences about ordinary expenses -- experiences are the touchstone of reasonable suspicion. Here, Deputy Mehrer found a vehicle on the road, learned that the registered driver was incapable of lawfully operating that vehicle, had the belief that under common sense the registered owner was likely the driver, pulled the vehicle over, initiated the stop, cited the individual for being a habitual violator. That common-sense belief that Deputy Mehrer had is one that has been recognized by the judges in 12 state supreme courts, four circuit courts is they stipulated to the facts that were relevant to the determination, and the Kansas Supreme Court made a determination as to those facts. My point is that didn't arise until the red brief in this Court.
And so we don't think it's fair to criticize once they've agreed.
If they wanted to indicate as to what the statistics were, they had an opportunity to call that officer and cross-examine him. Second, with regard to waiting for a violation, as Justice Kavanaugh talked about, we think that's a perfectly reasonable situation if we're going to eliminate reasonable suspicion. Rather, if there's a traffic violation, that's probable cause for a stop and that's not a basis.
This Court's decision has indicated that you don't have to wait for probable cause in order to initiate a stop.
And so I think your question was right on. Third, statistics.
We agree with the red brief that indicates that statistics are rarely present and frequently are going to be distinguished by the parties.
And so we don't believe that statistics are relevant. Fourth, we also believe that -- May I go back to the stipulation? You said it's -- Kansas drew the stipulation, right? The parties drew the stipulation, agreed to them, and presented them to the court. So it was a joint stipulation? The parties stipulated, yes, Your Honor. The fourth point I would like to make is that the Fourth Amendment does not and should not apply differently based upon the age and experience of the officer or the time of day of the Fourth Amendment. The rule that Respondents propose would require the officers to let this vehicle go at night because it's impossible to identify. This Court's cases, except for, I believe, a no knock warrant, does not do that.
Certainly, the reasonable suspicion cases do not do that. And, fifth, the states have a strong interest in regulating the roadways of the traffic situation here, and they have a strong law enforcement interest. For example, if there's a report of a -- a child that had been -- You can finish your thought. Thank you.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1059, Kelly versus United States. Mr. Roth. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Once again, the government is trying to use the open-ended federal fraud statutes to enforce honest government at the state and local levels.
Its theory this time is that the defendants committed property fraud by reallocating two traffic lanes from one public road to another without disclosing their real political reason for doing so. This theory turns the integrity of every official action at every level of government into a potential federal fraud investigation.
It end-runs McNally and Skilling by subsuming honest services fraud within property fraud and by criminalizing ulterior motives even without bribes or kickbacks.
It would effect a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction fraud. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Roth. Thank you.
Your Honor, the -- the federal property fraud statute prohibits schemes to obtain property.
And the government's theory of property here, as I think we just heard, is that the officials, by making this decision about lane alignment, commandeered the control over the George Washington Bridge. That is exactly the type of regulatory control that Cleveland said is not property.
Cleveland referred to the intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and control.
And the sovereign's intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and control are not property for purposes of this statute. And, therefore, if what the officials did was used a seat to influence the exercise of those rights, they have not obtained property from the Port Authority.
If that is not correct, then everything an official does is -- falls within the scope of this statute, and the only question that is open is was there some deceit involved? And if -- if that is right, I think the chilling effect on honest public servants is going to be severe. Mr. Roth, you responded to one-half of their theory.
One-half of their theory is the allocation of lanes. Yes. And the other half is the employee time. Yes. So what's your response to that? My response to that, it's actually what he said at the end, which is that the incidental costs of a decision are not the -- are not its object.
And it's what Your Honor asked in earlier question.
The implementation of the regulatory decision is going to use some public resources.
That cannot possibly change the result, or else Cleveland is a complete dead letter. Why do you call it incidental? I mean, it was essential to the scheme. Because it's incidental, Your Honor, in that it -- it was the implementation cost.
It flowed as -- as a result of the regulatory decision.
The regulatory decision was to realign the lanes. That required some employee time in terms of taking tolls and studying the traffic effect, but that was not the object.
That was how it got done. What if it cost a million dollars? Would it be incidental? No -- yes, Your Honor.
It would be a incidental.

"We will hear argument first this morning in Case Number 19-431, Little Sisters of the Poor versus Pennsylvania, and the consolidated case. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2011, the government required employers to provide insurance coverage for all FDA-approved contraception, including many religious employers who objected to the coverage, sparking years of litigation.
In 2017, in the best traditions of this country's commitment to religious liberty, the government sought to resolve the issue by promulgating new rules exempting those employers who objected to the mandate. Those exemptions are lawful for two reasons.
First, they're authorized by Section 13(a)(4) of the ACA, which requires employers to provide the types of coverage that the Health Resources and Services Administration provides for and supports.
So it authorizes defeat any opportunity for scrutiny as to whether an employer claiming an objection has a sincere religious belief, whether it is substantially burdened, and would essentially remove the courts from the process entirely. And -- and I think one point to -- to remember is we are dealing with the interplay between two statutes, and as -- as the Court acknowledged in Epic Systems v. Lewis, ultimately, deciding how two statutes work together, where the boundaries are, is a question for courts.
That can't be left just to the agencies. And we submit the Women's Health Amendment impose a mandatory obligation.
It says, ""shall at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost-sharing requirements for."" And, nevertheless, what is clear from the -- the floor debate on that is that Congress envisioned that it would require coverage for preventive services, that family planning would be included. Now you also have extremely important interests in RFRA and in the nature of the religious objections that are being claimed. Ultimately, courts need to resolve these questions.
And the agencies have essentially taken these decisions out of the -- the realm of the judiciary and decided for themselves.
And that -- that simply isn't how RFRA works, and under Epic, it's not how these questions should be resolved. Thank you very much, Mr. Fischer. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. General Francisco, you have a minute for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Although RFRA both authorizes and requires these exemptions, at the very least, they're justified under Section 13(a)(4).
That, after all, was the very basis for the church exemption back in 2011.
It's also the basis for the effective exemption that applies to self-insured church plans, as illustrated with respect to the colloquy between my friend and Justice Sotomayor.
And if you accept Respondents' interpretation of the accommodation, it's also the basis for the accommodation itself. Under my friend's position, they seem to concede that all of these other provisions violate Section 13(a)(4).
After all, the church exemption is not limited to ministers, and the church exemption applies to churches that don't even object to contraception. But regardless of how you resolve the issue, the rules here bring a decade-long dispute to a durable end, and they should be upheld. Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1501, Liu versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Rapawy. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: SEC disgorgement orders compel a payment to the Treasury as a consequence for violation of a public law.
An order like that is a penalty, as this Court's unanimous decision in Kokesh makes clear. A penalty must be authorized by statute.
So must any action by an administrative agency.
There is no statutory authority for the SEC to seek disgorgement orders from a federal court and, therefore, it cannot. I have three main points to make this morning.
First, the text, structure, and context of the securities laws offer a straightforward route to reversal.
Congress has created for SEC court actions a tiered system of civil money penalties Wang. And if you are applying the traditional historical approach, you would start at the gain to each defendant -- to each defendant.
You wouldn't start at the total losses to investors and take deductions from there.
And I think that goes to show how far the -- the -- both -- both what happened in this individual case and also how far the analysis that's going on here is from the historical approach. I think the scope of disgorgement has grown over time in part because it is not grounded in statutory text, and that counsel's for returning it to Congress rather than crafting a new remedy and -- and -- by -- as a sort of adapting equitable principles. I think its practical function has been to compel payments to the Treasury.
There is no historical precedent for that.
I would cite to the Court's Gabelli case, in which the Court found that there was no precedent for applying the equitable doctrine of the discovery rule to -- to cases by the government. So, too, here, there's no precedent for using an accounting to compel funds be paid to the Treasury. Finally -- What -- what about the statutes that assume the availability of disgorgement? Those statutes would have no work to do if -- if the Court can order disgorgement absent express statutory authority? We tried to show in our opening brief, Your Honor, that -- that most of those statutes do have some work to do.
There are one or two that don't. Even in those cases, I would say that those statutes at most reflect a presupposition or awareness by Congress that courts were doing this, not an authorization, and authorization is what's needed to authorize -- to inflict a penalty. Finally, if the Court does conclude that some remedy may survive -- may survive in some case, I would urge it, nevertheless, to reverse and not to remand in this case. These individuals have already been ordered to pay their entire gross pecuniary gains, and anything above and beyond that would go beyond the equitable principle that no individual should be -- should be permitted to profit from his or her own wrong. And with that, Your Honors, I would respectfully request the Court reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-8369, Lomax versus Ortiz-Marquez. Mr. Burgess. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are not strikes under Section 1915(g) for three reasons. First, the statute uses a familiar legal phrase with a well-established meaning in the context relevant here.
When courts review judicial orders to determine their impact on a future action, evaluating preclusion, for example, they conclusively presume that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" means dismissed with prejudice. In 1915(g), Congress used the same phrase in the same basic context.
There's every reason to think Congress expected courts to apply the phrase's settled meaning rather than to convert ordinary without-prejudice dismissals into sanctions that restrict future suits. Second, is that, while Rule 12(b), an authorization provision, allows for a dismissal with or without prejudice, when you are determining the impact of -- of a dismissal after it has previously been entered, it is -- there's a conclusive presumption that it is with prejudice. So we think Congress would have understood it that way.
And that fully explains the -- the difference between why the phrase is being interpreted one way in 1915(g) as opposed to the screening provisions, which mirror 12(b) in authorizing dismissal. Another point I'd like to make is I didn't hear a good response to Justice Kavanaugh's question as to why there would be a good reason to treat differently actions that -- instances in which a court allows amendment and then dismisses versus instances in which the court decides, well, I'm just going to dismiss this entire action without prejudice. And the other side's argument seems to rely on the notion that courts will by and large apply Rule 15 and allow multiple amendments.
As I indicated before, it's not clear that that is a preferable system.
And I think it's also not clear that that is consistent with the text of the PLRA. When you look at the screening provisions, in particular 1915(e) and 1997(e), they speak in terms of requiring the court to dismiss the action or the case. So the idea that they can cure the problem that their reading has by saying, well, courts are going to allow multiple amendments, so you don't have to worry about instances in which there is a without-prejudice dismissal, I don't think is consistent with how the -- the Act works as a whole. The final point I'd like to make is that the other side alluded multiple times to the -- how many prisoner suits there were and that they've decreased. As we noted in our reply brief, there's no indication that there is any different pattern in the Third or Fourth Circuit.
The Fourth Circuit has had this rule for over a decade and there's no indication that by adopting a clear rule that without-prejudice dismissals do not qualify as strikes, that there's been any significant uptick in prisoner litigation. If the Court has no further questions, we urge you to reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear first this morning in Case 18-1086, Lucky Brand Dungarees versus Marcel Fashions Group. Ms. Cendali. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should reverse the Second Circuit because it erred in holding that a defense never previously litigated to judgment can be barred in a case involving new claims. This Court rejected that idea over a hundred years ago in Cromwell and Davis, and as this Court unanimously made clear more recently in Taylor v. Sturgell, the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue preclusion, which forecloses relitigation of issues actually litigated and resolved, and claim preclusion, which forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim. Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free that before. Because to the extent that that case is -- is a new claim, they should be able to bring that.
There's an ongoing course of -- of conduct then -- then -- and you were made whole from the first nonpayment -- So that isn't the question, because everybody agrees it's a new course of conduct.
But this was a defense.
And they said you can't raise the defense.
And then Wright and Miller is a little worried about that.
They say, well, this is a question about estoppel.
And -- so -- so that seemed like a point on his side.
What about those cases? Well, it -- well, none of the cases, none of the cases cited in their brief, are on -- these facts.
With regard to the rent case, if it's -- if it means what was just said, then it's just wrong and not consistent with law.
And -- Counsel, let's assume that they had actually litigated, you had actually litigated whether the use of ""Lucky Brand"" trademarks, without the use of ""Get Lucky,"" was an infringement on the superior ""Get Lucky"" mark.
Let's assume the Court had said it's an infringement for you to do that.
No permanent injunction.
We're just going to give damages. Then there's now a new lawsuit that says you're continuing, after the old one, to use the ""Lucky Brand"" trademarks in the same way.
That's how they are pitching this to us, okay? Now you should be precluded because you had a full and fair opportunity to raise the settlement agreement as your right to use the ""Lucky Brands."" You didn't.
Why should you raise it now? That -- I think that that's the case that they say this is. Right. And assuming that were the case, you had a full and fair opportunity to litigate your use of ""Lucky Brands"" without ""Get Lucky,"" and the jury found that your use was an infringement, how could you then defend this case? May I answer? Yes. Well, you would defend it because the case sought subsequent relief for subsequent infringements where you would be allowed to present new defenses to that different period of time.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1023, Maine Community Health Options versus United States, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a massive government bait-and-switch and the fundamental question of whether the government has to keep its word after its money-mandating promises have induced reliance. The government suggests that there is no such thing as an enforceable congressional promise and that even the clearest command to pay money is subject to a caveat that it's subject to appropriations, and reliance, even on clear language, is ""inherently unreasonable."" That position is inconsistent with all this Court's cases, including the ones that go the government's way by finding an implied repeal for, in the government's view, there a trust.
And the Court found an action there. There, you really had to do some inferring and some implying to get to the cause of action, not so with respect to this kind of direct ""shall pay"" obligation. My friend also relied a lot on the Amtrak case.
I think it's worth taking a closer look at that case, because the kind of contract at issue there was the kind of contract that would essentially bind the federal government in perpetuity and prevent them even from taking action prospectively. So, there, it was basically about whether the employees of the railroads that got consolidated into Amtrak were going to get essentially a free pass for life.
And the Court in that context said, well, we don't want to bind future Congresses forever on that. But this is different.
This is whether you're going to be bound to a contract where the counterparty has already performed to their detriment.
And in those circumstances, I don't think there should be any special rule. Again, I think the two paragraphs in the Bowen dissent are exactly right.
I think this is a unilateral contract that's accepted through performance, and then the government has to pay. But, if for some reason you think you don't get a contract unless the statute says the word contract, then you just treat it as a statutory obligation to pay. My friend said that all those cases that Justice Scalia relied on are salary cases. That's not actually true.
There are also pension benefit cases there for pensions that are available or special benefits that are available to law enforcement officers and firefighters.
So this is not some principle that's been limited strictly to the context of salary provisions. And my final point is on what Congress was trying to accomplish here.
There is no question that they wanted to get the insurance companies to provide these policies.
But there is equally no question that they wanted the premiums to be relatively low. And in thinking about the billions of dollars that this failure to uphold their obligations is going to cost the government, you shouldn't lose sight of the fact that they also saved billions of dollars in tax subsidies by reducing the premiums through this -- through this commitment.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-9526, McGirt versus Oklahoma. Mr. Gershengorn. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is resolved by the fundamental proposition that decisions about sovereign rights are for Congress to make and Congress makes those decisions by speaking clearly in the text.
The decision below must be reversed because the text makes clear that Congress never terminated the Creek reservation and never transferred federal criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma. I have four basic points to make this morning.
First, the Creek Nation had a reservation.
The relevant treaties reserved the lands from sale and solemnly guaranteed the lands for the Creek to govern.
The text of both treaties and statutes expressly identified the Creek land as a reservation.
Nothing more was needed. Second, Congress Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Gershengorn, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
A number of things. Justice Gorsuch, first, you're exactly right.
This Court may not be able to determine which party had the better reading of events on the ground 120 years ago, but it is surely well-positioned to determine which party has a better reading of the text.
And on that score, I submit this case is not close. Second, Justice Ginsburg, two points. With respect to fee title, that was meant to be an additional protection because everyone understood the -- the imperfections in Indian title.
The Creek didn't even get their patent until 1852, 20 years after the reservation was -- was given.
Elimination of fee title does not eliminate treaty promises.
Those have to be disestablished through plain text. In addition, Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly right, the right, title, and interest language, which is the only text the other side can point to, conveys only proprietary interest, not sovereign interest, and so there is no textual transfer. There has been a lot of talk -- discussion this morning about irrespective of race.
It is -- one quick point on that. When Congress -- when -- in the Enabling Act in Section 13, what Congress put in place was the laws of the territory of Oklahoma, which did not have the supposedly magic language about ""irrespective of race."" That suggests that Congress well understood that the arguments the SG and Oklahoma are making on this score are -- are made up for today. Fourth, there was a lot of discussion about whether there's a compromise available on criminal jurisdiction.
There is not.
Justice Alito listed a number of factors for Mr. Kneedler.
One of the missing ones was the text. The text is very clear.
I was amazed that Mr. Kneedler said there was no basis for believing that there was -- ignoring the text. Nagonset said that is true.
Secretary Udall's memo listed seven states in which it were true. Finally, the numbers today are mind-boggling in the back of the envelope.
They don't appear in any of the briefs.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1109, McKinney versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State seeks to put James McKinney to death even though he's never once had a sentencing proceeding that complies with current law.
There are two separate paths for McKinney to win.
The path in question 1 argues that the Arizona Supreme Court reopened McKinney's sentencing proceeding.
The Ninth Circuit had earlier granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus and gave the State the option of either imposing a life sentence or seeking the death penalty again. The State chose the latter, which required brand new state action in the form of new sentencing.
The Arizona Supreme Court then did everything itself just as it had in 1996. That know, you should extend Clemons, particularly given this Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst and Haymond, all of which suggest that really juries have a fundamental role here. Now, with respect to question 1, our point to you is that resentencing was required by the Ninth Circuit.
They got a full-blown resentencing. We're not challenging -- he has some argument about a DIG.
We're not -- it wasn't in the briefs in opposition or below.
We're not challenging the Ninth Circuit's determination. We're challenging the Arizona Supreme Court's decision here to not comply with the law of this Court, Eddings and Jiminez, which reopened the conviction. Now, if you accept their view, you're going to basically license a state to slap the label of collateral review on and allow them to conduct new sentencing proceedings that will evade Batson, that will undermine everything that Justice Harwin tried to do when he tried to overrule -- when he overruled Linkletter.
And they'll be able to pick cases and say, oh, this time it won't be final.
That time it will. That's a very dangerous thing. I agree there are difficult cases, and my friend ended with this, there will be some difficult cases in the middle, but this is not that.
Eddings is the heart of what capital sentencing is about. And so, if you allow a reweighing for the first time on an appellate court when there's never been one in the trial court, you are -- you know, you're basically doing everything at that second stage.
And that, I think, is -- is profoundly -- profoundly against what this Court's precedents are. He's right to say Jimenez doesn't directly control this case.
That's not our argument.
Our argument is Jimenez states a truism, that when a case is final, as it was in 1996 when the Court ruled, it can be reopened by voluntary action by the state. And, here, that action happened.
The state reopened and set the clock back to 1996, and they -- you see when you look at and compare side-by-side the 2016 -- 2018 opinion to the -- to the 1996 one, there's actually more extensive analysis.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-935, Monasky versus Taglieri. Mr. Tayrani. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction is designed to protect children who have a country of habitual residence from the harmful effects of wrongful removal from that country.
In this case, however, the Convention was applied to separate two-year-old A.M.T. from her mother, the only caregiver A.M.T. had ever known, and to return the child to Italy, a country where A.M.T. had spent only the first eight weeks of her life. The Sixth Circuit's decision upholding A.M.T.'s return to Italy rests on an erroneous definition of habitual residence.
The Sixth Circuit held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent to raise A.M.T. in also the extent to which such an order would be accepted by the Italian authorities. Unless the Court has any further questions, thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Tayrani. Thank you.
Three points, Your Honor. With respect to the standard applied by foreign courts to cases involving infants, I would point the Court to paragraph 55 in the European Union Court of Justice's decision in the Mercredi case. The Court there stated that an infant necessarily shares the social and family environment of the circle of people on whom he or she is dependent.
Consequently, where the infant is, in fact, looked after by her mother, it is necessary to assess the mother's integration in her family and social environment. That is the standard that Lady Hale adopts in the A versus A case at paragraph 54, sub (6): Applying that standard in this case leads to one clear inextricable conclusion, that Monasky was not integrated into a family and social environment in Italy and that, therefore, A.M.T. did not have a habitual residence in Italy. This Court need look no further than the parties' stipulation at JA 28 and JA 29 that, as early as August of 2014, Monasky was already laying the groundwork for her return to the United States by looking for U.S. healthcare and child care options, U.S. employment, and U.S. divorce lawyers. This Court need look no further than JA 200 and JA 217, which are emails between the parties sent in the critical days preceding and following A.M.T.'s birth, where Monasky reiterated her intent to return to the United States and to divorce Taglieri. And this Court need look no further than Pet. App. 94a, where the district court found that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible. That's precisely what she did.
The day A.M.T.'s U.S. passport arrived, when A.M.T. was eight weeks old, Monasky fled the dangerous situation in which she found herself and returned to the United States. This Court can and should make that determination and it should order A.M.T.'s return to the United States for a full and fair child custody hearing, which is the only venue in that -- in which that hearing can take place.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1432, Nasrallah versus Barr. Mr. Hughes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the jurisdiction-stripping provision in (2)(C), it expressly defined the key term ""order of removal."" It is an order that finds an individual deportable or orders deportation. A CAT order does neither, and the government does not disagree.
CAT relief is temporary, applicable only to the country where an individual is likely to be tortured or killed.
If CAT relief is granted, the removal order remains enforceable.
As the government says, ""a grant of withholding or deferral leaves the final order of removal undisturbed."" When Congress enacted (2)(C), it also stripped jurisdiction of expedited removal orders.
This is Section (2)(A), reprinted in the government's brief at page broader effect of (2)(C) than what Congress actually wrote in (2)(C). But (2)(C) was pretty straightforward on its face because I remind the Court in A-47, that definition, order of deportation, was enacted by Congress for the specific purpose of defining the scope of (2)(C). Congress said in Section 440(a) of -- of AEDPA, we are going to strip jurisdiction for criminal aliens with certain convictions.
And in -- in 440(b), we're going to define the scope of that.
This is just simply outside the scope of the jurisdiction-stripping statute that Congress enacted as it defined when it engaged in enacting that -- that provision. But, next, if there's any doubt about this, if ultimately the Court thinks that these other provisions create multiple plausible interpretations of the statutory text, this is where the Court's strong presumption in favor of judicial review of agency action would do the work. Again, it's the government's burden not to show that there are multiple plausible interpretations but that its interpretation is the only correct one.
We think the text is unambiguous in our favor. But, if the Court disagrees with us, at the very least, there are multiple plausible interpretations, and, there, the presumption in favor of judicial review would do the work. And -- and then, finally, Congress purposefully chose to make CAT claims absolute. Congress -- this was a broad recognition to the horrors of torture. When there is an error in the administrative process, as the government just identified below, what that means is a court has found that the administrative agency made an error in finding that torture was not more likely than not. When there -- a CAT relief -- when CAT relief is granted, that means that there is a finding that it is more than 50 percent likely that the individual is going to be tortured or extrajudicially killed upon removal to that country. The United States has made a firm commitment that our deportation system is not going to be used to send an individual to a place where they are more likely than not to be subject to torture or deportation -- or torture or death. It is completely sensible that Congress did not extend (2)(C) to jurisdiction stripping in these circumstances.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1268, Opati versus the Republic -- Republic of Sudan. Mr. McGill. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Sudan provided Al Qaeda with a safe haven and vital material support enabling it to carry out the embassy bombings, killing 224 people and wounding thousands more.
In retaliation, President Clinton sent 13 cruise missiles into Khartoum.
But to impose punitive damages, Sudan argues, somehow would violate principles of fundamental fairness embodied in the Landgraf presumption. If fairness is the issue here, then Sudan surely should lose.
The State Department had designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993, but Sudan continued to shelter Osama Bin Laden even as he issued fatwahs calling for attacks on U.S. interests. In 1996 Congress enacted the same act or incident as Owens, we file under 1605A.
What happens then? Under 1605A1 -- I'm -- I'm sorry, under 1083(c)1, the amendments made by this section shall apply to any claim arising under Section 1605A. The amendments of 1083, therefore, apply to our claims.
And at page 43, Sudan concedes that -- and I'm reading now -- ""Section 1083(C)(1) simply provides that all the amendments under Section 1083 apply to a claim arising under Section 1605A."" All the amendments.
That includes punitive damages. But he's saying -- I think he's saying, look at the -- look at the first -- look at 2(b)(a) in the application to pending cases.
And he's saying with respect to any action brought under 1605(a)(7) -- small a -- that's where this retroactivity, that's where the thing applies, and he says his was -- yours isn't. We're not -- we're -- But you come to -- We're not -- -- the related part. -- a prior action.
We're a related action. Arising out -- But 1605A - -- of the same -- -- applies to both. Prior actions is the Acree case.
Prior actions are cases that already had punitive damages judgments that Congress said could be revived. Any judgment in the action ""shall be given effect as if it had been filed under 1605A(c)."" And it was for that reason that the President first vetoed it, and it was in response to the President's veto that Congress gives waiver authority with respect to Iraq. Mr. McGill, the one argument that they make that I -- can we avoid reaching, is a subject matter jurisdiction, whether relatives of victims for their independent state tort actions fall within any of these statutes, because they all require a U.S. nexus. Yes.
So the -- the argument is that claimant in 1085 -- 1605A(a) means legal representative.
That's their argument.
That argument is wrong for several reasons: First, it's contrary to the plain meaning of claimant.
Second, claimant or victim was language added in a technical amendment in 1997, and it was consistent -- may I -- You can get to third, and then -- Consistently -- consistently applied by lower courts for some 12 years.
And Congress legislated against that background, ratified that, and I'd cite the Inclusive Communities Project for that. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-267, Our Lady of Guadalupe School versus Agnes Morrissey-Berru, and the consolidated case. Mr. Rassbach. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If separation of church and state means anything at all, it must mean the government cannot interfere with the church's decisions about who is authorized to teach its religion. In this country, it is emphatically not the province of judges, juries, or government officials to decide who ought to teach Catholic fifth graders that Jesus is the son of God or who ought to teach Jewish preschoolers what it means to say: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one. And at bottom, that is what these cases are about: who controls who teaches applies and so schools can pay people different amounts, use race, sex, other private characteristics even when they have nothing to do with the religion and the religious values at stake. So we ask the Court to affirm. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rassbach, two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A -- a few points.
The first is that the proof is in the pudding, and we have the pudding here.
The ministerial exception has been working well for decades and has been using the functional consensus both before and after Hosanna-Tabor. And you look at pages 8 through 9 of the yellow brief, we explain that there are other cases where lay teachers and -- and have been decided under -- under the functional test. So there -- I would advert to the fact that the -- the federal government said there are three buckets, pastors, musicians, teachers. Teacher cases are common and they get decided under the functional consensus all the time. And I would say post-Hosanna-Tabor, there's been a real crystallization among the lower courts around the Alito concurrence in Hosanna-Tabor. By contrast, the Respondents' test has never been used.
And their claims of things like, you know, nurses, lots and lots of nurse cases -- there haven't been nurse cases in four decades.
There's not going to start being a lot now. There's no need to decide the co-religionist issue in this case.
In this case, they -- they are -- they were co-religionists and both schools wanted their teachers to be Catholic, just like in Hosanna-Tabor, when there were non- -- not people from that same religion that were used -- there were sometimes gap fillers employed. And, finally, this is a heartland case.
These teachers are the primary teacher of the faith.
They are the stewards of the faith. They are the leaders of their classroom.
They -- they -- the function of teaching the next generation is central, as Mr. Fisher just conceded.
These -- these are the people who will teach the faith to the next generation.
If -- if they don't do it, no one else will. The decisions below would replace Hosanna-Tabor's well-designed framework for deciding delicate church/state questions with a constitutional thicket.
They should be reversed. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-801, Peter versus NantKwest. Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An unsuccessful patent applicant may seek judicial review through either a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141 or a district court suit under Section 145. Section 145 states that an applicant who files suit under that provision must pay all the expenses of the proceeding. The question presented here is whether those expenses include money that the PTO spends to employ lawyers and paralegals who assist with the agency's defense of the suit. For three principal reasons, the answer to that question is yes.
First, the term ""expenses"" unambiguously encompasses costs -- encompasses money paid to employees or other personnel to accomplish that shouldn't include a pro rata share of the salary of the PTO examiner who worked on the case.
The Court would say that's crazy.
How could -- how could the PTO possibly effectuate its congressional mandate to collect aggregate expenses in a way that equals costs if it didn't -- if it didn't collect the single greatest expense that it incurs when a PTO examiner does his or her work? And, similarly, an appeal to the Board.
If each patent applicant was required to pay all the expenses of the Board proceeding, of course that would include an increment of money that was attributable to the time spent on the case by the Board judges, even though those judges are lawyers. No one would think that the American Rule required some clearer statement than that, that Congress intended the person who invoked that process to pay the extra expenses that the PTO incurs by virtue of that process. Similarly, the examiners on the patent side are typically not lawyers.
Trademark examiners are lawyers.
And the work that they do in examination is, therefore, lawyers' work. But nobody imagines that the American Rule has anything to do with the PTO's ability to make sure that people who invoke the examination services pay their fair share of the PTO's overall expenses. I think this goes back to a question that you got at the very beginning.
But setting attorneys' fees aside, could you tell us, Mr. Stewart, exactly what expenses you charge for and exactly what expenses you don't? I mean, sometimes we have charged for travel expenses.
We didn't in this case.
I don't believe we charged for printing costs, although I think we could have. With respect to personnel expenses specifically, we would charge for the lawyers. We would charge for the legal -- for the paralegals. In this case we had an outside expert who was -- was kind of paid money out of the agency's funds, and we did charge for that. There are other circumstances in which, rather than retain an outside expert, we get expertise from within the agency. So it could be the patent examiner who worked on the case or it could be somebody else, and we would charge a pro rata share of that person's time. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-107, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes versus the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Cole. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Aimee Stephens is a transgender woman. She was a valued employee of Harris Funeral Homes for six years, until she told her boss that she was going to live and identify as a woman. When Harris Homes responded by firing her, it discriminated against her because of her sex for three reasons: First, in firing her for failing to conform to its owner's explicitly stated stereotypes about how men and women should behave, it discriminated against her in the same way that Price Waterhouse discriminated against Ann Hopkins for failing to walk and talk more femininely.
It can't be in mouse holes. Everybody here agrees that Congress never thought that by prohibiting discrimination based on sex, they would also be prohibiting discrimination based on two very different traits, sexual orientation and gender identity. My friends would have this Court essentially reach that same result indirectly. I think all of the textual arguments cut in our favor straight away, but to the extent there is any doubt, there is no way to find that elephant in this mouse hole. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Cole. Thank you. Interpreting a statute is not depriving the democratic process.
It is doing what the Court is supposed to do within the democratic process, and of course if the democratic process disagrees with the Court's interpretation of the statute, it can change it. So there's no deprivation of the democratic process here. Secondly, the purpose of Title VII as this Court defined it was to make sex irrelevant to people's ability to succeed at work, to make sex irrelevant to people's ability to succeed at work. When Harris Homes fired Aimee Stephens because it learned about her sex assigned at birth being different from her gender identity, it did not make sex irrelevant to her ability to succeed at work.
It made it determinative. Think about it this way.
If Harris Homes fired a man because he was a man that would be sex discrimination.
If it fired an employee because he was insufficiently masculine, that would clearly be sex discrimination. In this case, Harris Homes fired Aimee Stephens because he thought she is a man who is insufficiently masculine.
That too must be sex discrimination. She's not seeking any special protection.
She is seeking and all transgender people are seeking the same protection that everybody else gets under the law.
This Court 30 years ago said in Price Waterhouse: ""We are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by insisting that they match the stereotypes associated with their group."" We are certainly beyond that day today as well, and what Harris Homes did was to insist that she match the stereotypes associated with her group.
That's impermissible under this Court's precedence, that's impermissible under the literal terms of the statute and this Court should rule for Aimee Stephens. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-5924, Ramos versus Louisiana. Mr. Fisher. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Last term in Timbs against Indiana, this Court reaffirmed the well-settled rule that incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights apply the same way to the states as they apply to the federal government. Taking that rule as the given, the state does not defend Justice Powell's pivotal vote in the Apodaca case.
And, indeed, that reasoning flouted precedent at the time and has since been relegated to nothing more than an isolated relic of an abandoned doctrine. The state's only defense in -- in support of the judgment below is that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity at all; that is, not in state courts or in Apodaca.
It's not just that it was a 4-1-4 vote, but it's just that -- it's that the other eight justices rejected the decisive reasoning in that case. And I think that makes this almost a universe of one. And if I could push it even further, I would say that if you have any doubts, look at Justice Powell's reasoning.
Justice Powell's reasoning in Apodaca itself was based on a refusal to follow precedent.
What he said was I'm agreeing with the past dissenters.
I know you have this rule from Malloy against Hogan from five years ago that requires the same standards to apply in a federal court as they apply -- in state court as they apply in federal court, but I don't want to follow that rule. He didn't even try to distinguish the Court's old holding.
So in a sense Apodaca itself was born of a disregard for stare decisis.
And so if you feel strongly about stare decisis as a value, this case is almost singular in its -- in its -- in the compelling reasons right now to -- to overrule Apodaca. Since you mentioned Balzac, can I ask you a question about that? So let's imagine this case is decided in your favor, and then a -- a defendant who has been convicted by a non-unanimous verdict in Puerto Rico comes here and he says, look, I am a citizen of the United States, and the only reason why I was able to be convicted by a non-unanimous verdict is -- are these old Insular Cases that reflect attitudes of the day in the -- in the end of the -- after the -- the aftermath of the Spanish American War, and just as you brushed aside Apodaca, you should brush aside the Insular Cases. I think I would -- I would say that would be different for all the reasons I just outlined.
The Insular Cases were majority decisions from the Court.
They were -- they were based on a view that has not been disregarded or left behind in the Court's jurisprudence. There may be arguments parties can make under ordinary stare decisis principles, but the last point I would leave you with is this is not an ordinary stare decisis case. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-938, Ritzen Group versus Jackson Masonry. Mr. Lehman. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 28 U.S.C. Section 158 provides that district courts shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final order of bankruptcy judges entered in cases and proceedings referred to bankruptcy judges under Section 157. The order in this case merely determined where the parties would litigate Ritzen's contract claim.
Under Section 158, such an order is not a final order entered in a case or proceeding. As this Court determined just four terms ago in Bullard versus Blue Hills Bank, the fact that an order disposes of a proceeding is not, despite what -- despite what Respondent and the government contends, the test for determining finality.
That, in the stay, with absolutely no authority to support that view other than the suggestion that 362(e) somehow imports a standard under 60(b). First of all, there have been no cases to suggest that.
In fact, the only cases that have been submitted to this Court suggest just the opposite. But the Respondent and the government continue to ignore the fact that 362(e) relates only to actions against the property.
And if the Court would look at the appendix to the government's brief, we did not include 362(e) because we did not believe it was relevant. But, on the government's brief at 4A, if you read 362(e)(1), the provision provides: ""Thirty days after a request under subsection (d) of this section for relief from the stay of any act against property of the estate under subsection (a) of this section."" Now, with respect to the questions about the permanent injunction, again, neither party has addressed the question that by definition under the statutory rules, 363 -- 362(c)(2)(C) says that the stay expires.
The word ""injunction"" is nowhere in 362. The stay expires on the discharge, which is what this Court recognized last term in Lorenzen.
And, by definition, it cannot be a final order because it is not a final injunction. It very well may act as a preliminary injunction under 1292(a), but that is something that this Court and Congress recognizes as an interlocutory appeal, not a final order. Now, with respect to the question about the scrambling of the eggs, the concern of the Court has been addressed by what exactly happened here. First of all, the creditors have been paid, as the Respondent represented, but they all got 100 cents on the dollar.
That was represented from day one.
And that was, in part, the basis for the bad faith claim that the bankruptcy was filed inappropriately. So the fact that the debtor -- that the creditors were paid 100 cents on -- I see my time is up. You can finish your thought. The fact that the -- the creditors received 100 cents on the dollar did not mean that this will be unscrambled, but that -- and they received 5.6 million dollars in cash since then, we believe would satisfy any problem that we have.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1269, Rodriguez versus the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Reich. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is what body of law courts should apply to determine ownership of consolidated tax refunds. In our view, the answer to that question is straightforward. Courts should apply state law.
That's the body of law that virtually always governs property rights disputes in our federal system, and, here, the political branches have not displaced that traditional area of state power either by statute or by federal regulation. The FDIC takes a different approach, although exactly what that approach is has changed somewhat over the course of this litigation.
In the lower courts, the FDIC advocated a rule not allow the term agents to do all the work of establishing an agency relationship. This is Black Letter common law represented in the third restatement, the second restatement. It's illustration two in the entire second restatement, is making the point that calling something an agency agree -- agree -- an agency does not establish an agency relationship.
And the Colorado Supreme Court has said many times that words are not enough, in the City of Aurora case and in the Moses case.
And this doesn't mean it's hard in any way to assign a refund to the subsidiary. The easiest way to do so is in the government's -- in the banking regulators guidance, their 2014 addendum to their policy statement, which is cited on page 9 of the government's brief, it provides model language that parties can use to achieve the result it's advocating here, which establishes a trust relationship, which is very easy to establish under state law, requires nothing more than designating someone a trustee and requiring funds to be held to -- to -- to be clearly set aside for the subsidiary. And we think that model language is perfectly sufficient to achieve this result. An agency relationship is harder to create.
It requires interim control.
And -- and that's been the law in almost every state and in Colorado for a long time. I -- I -- I'd like to -- Maybe I don't hate interrupting as much, but -- (Laughter.) -- it seems I don't know exactly what you're seeking.
If I say you're my agent, you get this money, pay it over to me in ten days, do I have to tell them how to pay it over to me? Do I have to tell them that I have the ability to redirect payment to someone else? I have to do all those things under Colorado law? May I finish? Briefly. To establish an agency under the common law, the -- the subsidiary would at least need to reserve the right to direct how the subsidiary fills out -- how the parent fills out -- fulfills that task either by having authority to direct it to seek the refund in the first place or direct how it handles the refund once it's received.

The question presented here is whether the -- this phrase ""principles of equity"" requires trademark owners to prove willfulness as an absolute precondition to profit awards. The answer is no for three reasons: First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" signifies a multifactor analysis where no one factor is controlling. Second, the phrase -- excuse me.
The statutory text and structure supersede any settled willfulness requirement. And, third, there was no such settled background willfulness requirement. First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" refers to the familiar equitable in the same breath said fraudulent intent was also required for damages. So it's a -- All of those cases say that -- All of the treatises -- You're right. -- four out of the five. All of the treatises. Yeah, forgive me. One of the cases. Nobody is claiming, are they? I wouldn't -- Nope. No. Nope.
That's our argument. Nobody is claiming that you need willfulness for -- that the client, no matter how poor, no matter how -- he gets his damages, right? Right.
Our argument is -- the other side just wants to take you up to where they win this case.
The actual common law sources say fraudulent intent and it also extends to damages. This is just another way of saying the law was a mess and it wasn't that clear.
When three out of their eight cases say there was a conflict, I just think the whole notion of the Morissette or we cite that Fogerty versus Fantasy cases, if you just have a lack of clarity on the issue, you don't have a basis to presume that Congress wanted you to read in an unstated requirement. And I think in at least in the -- the -- -- the Justice Scalia and Garner book, it says, when you're talking about clarity, it's something that all the members of the bar had to agree was settled, and if the very case as it's -- that was conflicted, if the treatises say it wasn't clear, and if the cases are all over the map, again, the fact that we have three cases where they award profits is kind of either here nor there when we had eight cases that are just inconsistent with the willfulness requirement, including, I will end with, I will sit down early, is Champion Sparkplug case.
It's a case in 1947, it was construing the 1905 Act, said it's relevant.
And then it cited two other factors as part of the equities. That's, to me, you know, just -- it -- it would be hard to find a settled rule from 40 years of silence under the Lanham Act's predecessor.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-328, Rotkiske versus Klemm. Mr. Gant. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While this case is about the FDCPA, it is also fundamentally about the relationship between this Court and Congress.
That relationship has long been governed in part by two important presumptions relevant here: first, that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law and, second, that Congress legislates aware of this Court's decisions. When Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, this Court had long ago adopted a common law rule eventually known as the discovery rule applicable to cases of fraud and concealment. Citing to and quoting the Bailey decision of this Court from 1875, in Holmberg in 1946, this Court stated that it had long ago Third Circuit law, there was a requirement for some additional action, which Petitioner's counsel did not believe was present here. The next point is -- concerns this question of whether the discovery rule is a matter of an exception, an equitable exception to a statute which is imposed by courts themselves, or whether it's statutory interpretation. The touchstone in either case, as Justice Kagan, I believe, was -- was alluding to, is congressional intent.
And we believe that Congress here, when you look at the statute as a whole, not ignoring the language in 813(d) but the statute as a whole, including its purposes, including its exhortation that it wanted to eliminate the practices at issues, clearly would not have meant to foreclose a lawsuit by -- which presented facts like Petitioner's facts here. The final point I'd like to raise concerns -- sorry, one final -- other point related to that. I believe I heard counsel for the Respondent say that under his view the discovery rule is a subset of equitable tolling.
I could understand why one would come to that view given the confusion in the doctrine.
I've set out a different view, which we think is the better understanding. But, if their view is correct, then I don't know how they can argue it was waived.
If the discovery -- the Holmberg/Bailey rule is a subset of equitable tolling, we pressed the Bailey/Holmberg rule below.
Those cases were cited in the supplemental briefing after the Court decided to go en banc. So I think the assertion that the arguments that we're presenting here were waived are -- are incorrect. The final point concerns Respondent's challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint. The district -- the district court in the Third Circuit here understood exactly what was at issue. I must candidly acknowledge that the complaint here was not a paragon of clarity.
It could have been done better.
And if we were given the opportunity on remand, which we would because Rule 15 provides for liberal amend -- amendment of pleadings, we would make clear that the challenged conduct violates 1692(e) and (f) of the statute, which we believe clearly falls within the ambit of the common law discovery rule.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 19-7, Seila Law versus the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Shanmugam. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The structure of the CFPB is unprecedented and unconstitutional.
Never before in American history has Congress given so much executive power to a single individual who does not answer to the President.
By significantly limiting the President's ability to remove the CFPB's director, Congress violated the core presidential prerogatives to exercise the executive power and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. This Court has recognized and reaffirmed the principle that the Constitution empowers the President to keep principal officers accountable by removing them at will. While the Court created a narrow exception in Humphrey's Executor in the Two -- two minutes, Mr. Shanmugam. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just three points on jurisdiction, the merits, and the remedy, respectively. On jurisdiction, amicus, who is appointed to defend the judgment below, now seems primarily to be arguing that this Court made a mistake in granting certiorari because of the existence of the ratification question. As a preliminary matter, that was flagged by both sides at the cert stage and this Court, nevertheless, granted review, and I would respectfully submit for good reason. Ratification goes at most to the remedy for the constitutional violation here. And that issue is obviously not briefed before this Court.
It was raised by the government in the Ninth Circuit. But notably, unlike in the other cases involving challenges to the CFPB's constitutionality, the government provided no factual support, no declaration, nothing in support of ratification. I think the ratification is deeply legally problematic here, too, and I would refer the Court to the amicus brief of RD Legal Funding if the Court has questions about that, and ratification wouldn't solve the constitutional problem because, even if the CID itself had been ratified, the continued prosecution of this enforcement action would still present exactly the same constitutional concern. Now, on the merits, amicus disparages the notion that the removal power is illimitable.
Ironically, the Court used exactly that adjective in Humphrey's Executor, at least where agencies are performing executive functions. No one defends the rationale of Humphrey's Executor distinguishing between executive functions and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial functions. And our approach gives meaning to Humphrey's Executor and allows the Court to leave it in place by limiting it to the multi-member context. Amicus's proposed approach by contrast would really create an exception without limit. And the exception cannot be limited to cabinet officers because, for those cabinet officers who exercise enumerated constitutional responsibilities, that's only two, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. All 13 of the other cabinet officers as the cabinet is currently constituted would be removable.
The judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-6662, Shular versus United States. Mr. Summa. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Shular has prior convictions for drug offenses lacking the mens rea element necessary to distinguish between blameworthy and otherwise innocent conduct. In 1986, one state, North Dakota, had dispensed with the element of guilty knowledge for its drug trafficking crimes.
Today, Florida is the only state lacking a guilty knowledge element.
Florida's law is an aberration. The question here is whether Congress intended convictions under such an aberrational law to support the extreme sentencing enhancement of up to life in prison under ACCA. The answer is no for a variety of reasons. First, the state offense provision presents a list of generic crimes which all the Court still thinks there's ambiguity about what ""manufacturing of a controlled substance"" means or ""distribution of a controlled substance"" means, begin by looking to the related statute for how it defines the crimes.
The related statute here is, of course, the federal drug trafficking provision, which describes the crimes to include a mens rea element, and the Court said in Esquivel-Quintana, then look to the survey of state law to see how the states define the crimes and all those factors contribute to the -- to the finding of the definition of what constitutes the generic federal crime. If Congress had before it when it drafted this provision of ACCA these two models, the federal model where the prosecution has to prove that guilty knowledge of the nature of the substance, and the Florida model, which differs only in that the defendant has to raise this as a -- an affirmative defense, has to say I didn't know that it was an illegal substance, Congress would think there's enough difference between those two models to say that only the former is included and not the latter? I think Congress -- yes, Congress would have decided the law is so overwhelmingly in favor of a mens rea element, that's what we generally would contemplate. Is there any practical difference between those two? I -- I mean, I don't see it.
I don't think very many people are going to get -- get acquitted under the federal law unless they're willing to stand up and say I didn't know this was cocaine, in which case the two things are exactly the same. Well, Your Honor, I respectfully say that you are giving short shrift to the general requirement -- my time's up, may I -- You may.
Go ahead. You are giving general short shrift to the significance of jury findings. If a jury does not find, as it does in the Florida law, that the defendant has engaged in blameworthy conduct, the court, in a federal court, in a sentencing proceeding should assume that the defendant did not have that guilty knowledge because the -- the -- the federal sentencing court cannot make that finding for the first time in a collateral sentencing proceeding.
And I thank you very much. Thank you, counsel.

"On behalf of the Respondents 34 We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-1712, Thole versus United States Bank. Mr. Stris. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My clients are beneficiaries of a pension trust.
We allege that the trustees, through disloyalty and imprudence, caused the trust to lose $750 million.
The suit presents a justiciable case or controversy for three reasons: First, my clients have an equitable interest in all assets of their pension trust. That is a property interest.
And when $750 million of that property was lost, my clients suffered a concrete injury. Respondents are between a rock and a hard place.
They can't argue that participants have an equitable interest in only some of the trust corpus, because the trust is unsegregated to be paid in the future with money put in a trust as security.
That's all fact.
No one can dispute that. The question is do we have a -- an interest, my clients in the trust, and what is that interest? So let's sweep aside the question begging and get to the main issue. Our point is it's always been the case since the 15th century that we have an interest. At first, my friend doesn't dispute this.
Look at page 25 of their brief.
He says in the 15th century, chancellors began to recognize the beneficiaries' interest as a form of ownership, protecting it much like the common law treated the legal interest in property. This is why he spends much of his brief and he gets up here today and he says: Ah, the participants, the beneficiaries, they're not actually the beneficiaries.
The plan is the beneficiary. If he's right, we lose.
But he's obviously wrong, because the beneficiaries are the beneficiaries.
To your questions earlier, Justice Kagan, you don't need to look any further than the congressional statements of purpose.
Everything in ERISA says that to protect the interest of these individuals, we're putting the money in the trust. So that's the property interest. There's nothing abstract about it.
That's how it's been for a while and for good reason. Okay. I'm going to take my points out of order.
The second one is the practical concerns.
What is the good reason? Because I think there's a reason why the United States Government across a number of -- of administrations have endorsed this position of standing.
It's because -- Justice Breyer, you say imprudence cases.
Well, maybe standing should be a gatekeeper, because can people sue in every case, like when there's been a loss -- I get it.
That's a concern.
I don't think it should inform the standing inquiry.
Think of the flip side. The flip side is if their rule is correct, you will have to have, to figure out if there's an injury, a battle of experts in every case about the level of risk and potentially throughout the case about the level of risk. Entirely unworkable.
Again, this shouldn't drive standing, but if it's the elephant in the room.
And in situations of catastrophe like AIG and Enron, there's no solution.
We ask that you reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-916, Thryv Incorporated versus Click-To-Call Technologies. Mr. Charnes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of the America Invents Act, the statutory history, the statute's policy goals, and this Court's decision in Cuozzo all confirm that Section 314(d) precludes judicial review of the director's time-barred determination under Section 315(b). Begin with the text of the statute. Congress drafted the appeal bar to apply to ""the determination whether to institute an inter partes review under this section."" Congress could have written Section 314(d) to review only the determination whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the petition -- petitioner would prevail, but Congress wrote the provision more broadly to apply to the institution decision as a whole. Further, Section second point, my -- my friend referred to several times the Section 303 and former Section 312 and suggested that they're analogous to what Congress did here in 314.
But that -- that's simply not true. If you look at former Section 312(c), what it says is ""a determination by the director under subsection (a) shall be final and non-appealable."" If Congress meant to limit the preclusion of judicial review to the preliminary patentability determination in subsection (a) of Section 314, there is no reason it would not have used the language that was already in the statute, that it was replacing, when it drafted the America Invents Act.
It did not do that. It specifically changed the language.
And that change has to have some -- some meaning. Third, my friend also mentioned, when asked, I believe, what work Section 314(d) did, said that, well, it bans interlocutory review. Well, that rationale was specifically rejected by this Court in Cuozzo, where it said it was not limited to simply prohibiting, you know, interlocutory review.
In fact, it would have been superfluous if that was the purpose of -- of the statute -- of the -- of the provision. And, fourth, going to your question, Justice Sotomayor, we -- we disagree that there's not -- we think there is an asymmetry here if -- if Respondent is correct.
This Court in Cuozzo said clearly that denial of an IPR petition is committed to the agency's discretion. And that means it's unreviewable.
And that's how the federal circuit in several decisions has interpreted it.
In the Wi-Fi One case, which is the en banc case that was applied below, the court said that a denial cannot be reviewed.
And in the Saint -- more recently in the Saint Regis Mohawk case, it said the same thing. So I think you've got an asymmetry here, which is that legal determinations made by the Board in the course of granting review, if Respondent is right, can be reviewed after final written decision on appeal. But, if the -- if the Board denies review on the basis of a legal determination, that will never be reviewed. So here, for -- here, for example, if the Board came to the opposite conclusion, it would not be reviewable. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"The first case we will argue today is Case 19-715, Donald Trump versus Mazars, USA. Mr. Strawbridge. Before these cases -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The subpoenas at issue here are unprecedented in every sense.
Before these cases, no court had ever upheld the use of Congress's subpoena power to demand the personal records of a sitting President, and no committee of Congress had even tried to compel production of such a broad swath of the President's personal papers, let alone for the stated purpose of considering potential legislation. There is a reason that this is the first time a congressional committee has attempted such a gambit.
It has long been understood that because Congress's subpoena power is implied, it is auxiliary and subordinate.
And when ability to set some sort of limiting principle or some category of information or documents about the President that would not be obtainable under his theory. And I think that's very telling because there are no limits to their theories. And, in particular, let's just consider the example that was given regarding medical records.
There is no reason under his theory why the President and his family and his grandchildren could not be declared useful case studies and, therefore, Congress could send out a subpoena for their medical records. For that matter, the President eats and drinks like everybody else and Congress naturally has the ability to regulate food safety. But that does not mean that Congress can subpoena medical records or even the President's DNA.
My friend refused to even rule out that hypothetical categorically below, and I think it's telling that -- that he can't provide any meaningful limit today. And I think that's consonant with the fact that they failed to consider what their actual legislative need is.
This is an implied power in aid of legislation.
It's not a free-ranging warrant to investigate wrongdoing going back 10 years. They -- he cites to a laundry list of legislative proposals, almost all of which were passed before these subpoenas even issued.
And at no point in the argument section of their brief or today does he try to tie any particular legislative proposal specifically to the President's finances, let alone the vast swath of documents that they seek here. This is not an attempt to preserve the separation of powers.
It's an attempt to eviscerate that. On that point, I wanted to note, in response to Justice Breyer's question, which I may have misunderstood, the Senate Watergate committee, in fact, did serve congressional subpoenas under the legislative power and, applying the heightened need standard, the D.C. Circuit invalidated it, just as this Court invalidated the attempt to hold in contempt somebody in Kilbourn when it violated the separation of powers, just as the lower courts every time separation of powers has squarely been presented have invalidated it. These subpoenas are overreaching. They are an obvious distraction.
They are going to multiply if this Court accepts the path that the House is attempting to lay.
The decisions below should be reversed.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-635, Donald Trump versus Cyrus Vance. Mr. Sekulow. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No county district attorney in our nation's history has issued criminal process against a sitting President of the United States, and for good reason.
The Constitution does not allow it. Temporary presidential immunity is constitutionally required by Article II, and, accordingly, the Supremacy Clause defeats any authority the DA has under state law as to the President.
The Second Circuit is wrong and should be reversed. If not reversed, the decision weaponizes 2300 local DAs.
An overwhelming number of them are elected to office and are thereby accountable to their local constituencies.
The decision would allow any DA to harass, distract, and interfere with the sitting President.
It well within the scope of legal process permitted by this Court for generations, indeed, back to 1807.
Past decisions have consistently found that courts already have robust tools to protect presidents from abusive claims or demands. There's no need here to upend precedent or to write a new rule that undermines federalism, especially when such a rule would create a risk that American presidents, as well as third-parties, could unwittingly end up above the law. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sekulow, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start with this, and there's some agreement.
The New York district attorney, New York County district attorney, acknowledges that their subpoena implicates Article II issues and burdens.
They also agree that there is harms that could arise to the presidency.
We say those harms have actually existed. The other aspect of this is the ordering, who carries the burden here.
That seems to be the issue that's left open.
This Court's decision in Cheney answered that very clearly, that said that the exacting standard is carried by the party requesting the information. So it would be carried by the Respondent in this particular case. There has been no showing and no findings of heightened need standards being met here.
That -- and I think it's again also important to remember -- and I think this came up in the context of earlier questioning -- there's a different stigma that attaches to criminal process than civil litigation.
And I don't think that stigma should be ignored in a case like this. But the irony of all of this is that the House of Representatives and the district attorney issued essentially the same subpoenas to the same custodian for the same records. The House said it wants the records so it can legislate, not for law enforcement reasons.
The district attorney says he wants the same records for law enforcement reasons; he has no legislative authority. But what's really happening here could not be clearer.
The presidency is being harassed and undermined with improper process that was issued, in our view, for illegitimate reasons.
The copying of the subpoena speaks to that. The framers saw this coming, and they structured the Constitution to protect the President from this encroachment. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-46, United States Patent and Trademark Office versus Booking.com. Ms. Ross. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is a fundamental principle of trademark law that no party can obtain a trademark for a generic term like ""wine,"" ""cotton,"" or ""grain."" As Judge Friendly explained and as the Lanham Act confirmed, a generic term is never entitled to trademark protection no matter how much money and effort the user has poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what success it has achieved in securing public identification. In other words, secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness is simply irrelevant to generic terms.
That principle controls here. It is undisputed that ""booking"" is generic for the hotel reservation services Respondent points to this idea that the PTO has been applying the primary significance test.
That's true with the Goodyear sort of guardrail.
It understands that a generic term can't be made into a trademark simply by showing that a bunch of consumers think that it -- it's associated with a particular mark or a particular brand. Now Respondent's example actually -- or Respondent's survey actually proves this point.
There was a lot of back and forth about washing -- ""washingmachine.com"" versus ""Booking.com,"" but I think what's really instructive here is ""washingmachine.com"" versus ""supermarket."" Thirty-three percent of Respondents in Respondent's survey thought that ""washingmachine.com"" was a brand name.
Zero, not a single survey respondent, thought that ""supermarket"" had that -- that characteristic. So, clearly, the .com context is doing a ton of work on Respondent's view. The third point that Respondent really hit was this idea that there wouldn't be any competitive harm from Respondent's rule.
I think that's clearly not correct. We know that because of the same reason that we know that booking companies shouldn't be allowed to be trademarked.
We just know that when you have -- that a trademark law is not supposed to take terms off the table, that everyone needs to describe their goods. I think, you know, Respondent focused on certain examples, like ""tickets.com"" and ""Container Store."" I think, again, Respondent is misunderstanding that you have to always look at how -- what those are registered for.
So ""tickets.com,"" for example, for ticket management services, not for tickets generally. So they're massively overstating what's going on here. I think, again, there might be hard questions at the margins on some of these, whether something like ""container"" or ""tickets"" is being used in its generic sense, but that's not reflective of the .com or the company. That's at that first root level. Finally, I think, if they're not going to sue ebooking.com and hotelbooking.com, it's really unclear what they want out of this. Ripping off Respondent referred to is covered by unfair competition.
Typosquatting likewise is covered by unfair competition.
And Section 1125(d), which Respondent pointed to, presumes that you have a preexisting trademark like Kodak or like Xerox or like Teflon in the old days, and someone goes along and -- Thank you, counsel. -- gets the trademark -- Thank you, counsel.

"This morning we will hear argument in Case 19-177, United States Agency for International Development versus the Alliance for Open Society International.
I note at the outset that Justice Kagan is recused in this case. Mr. Michel. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Twenty years ago, the HIV/AIDS pandemic was devastating the world.
In response, President Bush proposed and Congress adopted the Leadership Act.
Since reauthorized three times, the Act has committed nearly 80 billion dollars to global AIDS relief, and it has worked, saving more than 17 million lives in the most successful American foreign aid effort since the Marshall Plan. The funding condition at issue here requires recipients to have a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, which Congress found are coercive practices that spread HIV/AIDS Act funds. Unlike in this case last time and unlike in cases like Hurley and Masterpiece, the U.S. entity is not required to make that choice. The U.S. entity has a separate choice to accept Leadership Act funds itself and operate itself without -- in -- in foreign countries without any risk of hypocrisy or -- or a mixed message. As Justice Gorsuch says, you have to take the sweet with the sour when you decide to set up a separate corporate entity. Now my friend suggests that either U.S. funding conditions or foreign law somehow give an incentive for -- for U.S. entities to use foreign affiliates, but they're not challenging any U.S. funding decisions, which would, we believe, beyond -- be beyond challenge anyway.
And foreign law certainly cannot change the scope of a U.S. entity's First Amendment rights. My -- my friend's position ultimately rests on what he frames as a risk of attribution test.
But I think Judge Straub got it right below when he called that position startling. As Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Alito both, I think, alluded to, that test would be unworkable and it would call into question all manner of U.S. speech restrictions on foreign entities abroad. Now my friend says there's a distinction between speech restrictions and speech compulsions, but the risk of attribution test that he has outlined, where you simply compare names, logos, and brands, has nothing to do with the distinction between speech attribution and speech compulsion. And in all events, the foreign entities here are only, if the -- if the U.S. entities choose, required to make the statement in a -- in a letter to USAID, not to shout it from the mountaintops and not to say anything that will ultimately interfere with the U.S. recipient's message. Finally, I want to note Respondents never made this argument for more than a decade of the litigation.
I think what happened is that, having secured rights for U.S. entities, they decided to ask for the world. But there's no basis in this Court's prior decision or any other source of law for that -- for that holding.
It would invalidate a provision that Congress has adopted and reauthorized and that is working. The decision below should be reversed. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1587, the United States Forest Service versus Cowpasture River Preservation Association, and the consolidated case. Mr. Yang. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the Trails Act converts all federal, state, and private lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail into lands administered by the Park Service.
It does not. The Act simply charges the Secretary of the Interior with overall administration of a trail.
It repeatedly distinguishes between the agency administering the trail and the land managing agencies administering the land.
The Park Service thus coordinates -- or -- agencies and organizations responsible for their own segments of the trail, and informs certain trail-wide responsibilities, but the land managing agencies ultimately -- ultimately take 1246(a)(1)(A) specifically says the Interior has overall administration of the trail, but then says there's no transfer of management responsibilities for federally-administered lands.
That's the antithesis of the clarity that Congress acts with when it wants to transfer -- Excuse me, Mr. Yang -- -- its exertion of land -- -- that's the problem, which is read that definition. Management and administration have two different meanings.
It says we don't transfer management when -- I get the point.
But the problem is -- That's the problem. -- Petitioner -- the first sentence says: ""Overall administration is administration and management of the trail."" If Petitioner is right that the trail is land, that includes management of the land. But that makes a hash of the second sentence, which says, ""no authority over the land management is transferred."" So Petitioner also -- or Respondent has a problem with Sections 1246(e) and (h)(1), both of which apply only outside the boundaries of federally-administered land, (h)(1) where the trail is outside, and (e) where the right-of-way is outside. There is no such thing under Respondent's theory because the right-of-way and the trail is federally-administered land.
The overall administration -- this is the position of the agencies for 50 years -- that overall administration is spelled out in the Act.
It's a continuous route. You select the right-of-way and then you relocate it.

"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-67, United States versus Sineneng-Smith. Mr. Feigin. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent acknowledges that in the context of a criminal law, the terms ""encourage"" and ""induce"" can refer solely to acts that facilitate or solicit unlawful activity.
That's the meaning that they have in the context of this criminal law. There's no reason to reach out and give them a vastly more expansive interpretation simply to strike the statute down.
Prohibitions on facilitating or soliciting unlawful activity have existed since before the founding and are perfectly constitutional. Interpreting this law to be unconstitutionally overbroad would deviate from that tradition and directly contradict the canon of constitutional avoidance. Historical understanding and practice confirm that Congress didn't use statute may reach some protected speech, it can be handled as applied.
There is no reason to read this statute as broadly as Respondent is contending that it needs to be read here and that the Ninth Circuit read it for the very first time -- Mr. Feigin -- -- in this case. -- what in reading this statute would give an average person notice of all of the limitations you're suggesting to us? Because I read ""encourage or induce an alien to come, enter, or reside in the U.S., knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law,"" seems to me that all of the examples that were raised earlier, the hospital that's treating a child with -- an illegally present child with a disease, the church who provides worship to illegal aliens, all of the other examples that were given on their face to the common reader of those words would be a violation of the statute. Well, Your Honor, I don't think that is the standard -- I don't think that's the standard this Court applies that someone is ignorant of what those words mean in the context of the criminal law. Again, these are not -- these are not words that are unique to this statute.
If you look at the LaFave treatise, Section 13.2, the word ""encouraging"" is used as the title of section headings to describe accomplice liability.
This Court used the word -- But accomplice liability -- -- ""induce"" in Williams. -- has all sorts of meaning that you're not endorsing.
You're saying this is not aiding and abetting.
You're saying it's not solicitation.
It's something else -- No, Your Honor -- -- altogether? -- we are using the principles of complicity and solicitation in a statute that is directed at large amounts of criminal activity to inform what these words mean here. I -- I suppose it is possible that someone who does not have any knowledge of how those words are used in the context of facilitation or solicitation statutes might look at it and might have the reaction that they should be given a different meaning, but I don't think that's the standard this Court should apply.
