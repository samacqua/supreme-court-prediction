"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-877, Allen versus Cooper. Mr. Shaffer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When states infringe the exclusive federal rights that Congress is charged with securing, Congress can make states pay for doing so.
That's our respectful submission today, one that follows from the Constitution's text and affords ample basis for this Court to uphold the work Congress did in enacting the CRCA. Article I, Section 8, clause 8, what we're calling the intellectual property clause, is unique within Article I in laying down an express constitutional mandate for Congress to protect specified private property rights against any and all intrusion. Consider just how pointed and clear the constitutional text is.
Congress is not only to be granting copyrights but securing them, and the resulting rights by definition are meant to be exclusive rights.
Exclusive against whom, Your Honors? Exclusive against all comers, exclusive against the world, including the government and including states. And this exercise of congressional power serves the express constitutional purpose to promote progress.
How? By affording monetary recompense to copyright holders.
The framers thus made very clear that all those wanting to use an author's copyright are meant to be paying money for doing so. This clause's text signals a plan of the convention waiver like no other in Article I.
For states to retain immunity to avoid paying for infringing the very same exclusive rights that Congress is meant to secure would be incompatible with the text as fixed and understood by the framers. And this Court has already so recognized in substance.
Going back to 1888, in United States v. Palmer, the Court said in holding the federal government monetarily liable for infringing patents that Congress's power, the same power we were just talking about, could not be affected if the government had a reserve right to infringe.
Same reasoning holds for states, Your Honors. And in Goldstein v. California in 1973, the Court said -- and, again, in -- here discussing copyrights -- when Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its effects are pervasive.
No citizen or state may escape its reach. All -- all that is -- would be highly persuasive if we didn't have the patent decision, the Florida Prepaid decision.
It is the very same clause.
It's the very same secure.
It's the very same exclusivity. Correct, Justice Ginsburg.
But -- but the Court was not examining the text.
The Court was not examining the clause.
In fact, it didn't even grant review on the question whether the Article I basis for the Patent Remedy Act would be a valid basis.
That wasn't before the Court.
It wasn't even raised before the Court. And so all the Court did, Justice Ginsburg, was refer back to Seminole Tribe, that the sweeping assumption of Seminole Tribe that no Article I clause could ever supply a basis for abrogation.
That's the same assumption that the Court in Katz more recently called dicta and held to be erroneous dicta, an erroneous assumption, which is the only way that the Court was able to analyze the specifics of the Bankruptcy Clause and find that it did reflect a plan of the convention waiver -- In -- in -- -- and a basis for abrogation. -- in Katz, the -- the Court concentrated on the bankruptcy authority as a unique authority.
We have Seminole, which is across the board, and then we have the exception for the Bankruptcy Clause. Now are you asking us to go through all of the Article III authority and take them one by one? Isn't Katz more properly read as a bankruptcy exception to the Seminole Tribe rule? Your Honor, we rely upon the methodology of Katz and we rely upon the upfront holding of Katz.
We take it to be a holding that, in fact, what Seminole Tribe had said about no Article I power supplying a basis for abrogation, that that was dicta, and that was an erroneous assumption. In fact, the relevant portion of Seminole Tribe, as both the majority and the dissent in that case recognized, it dealt with the Copyright Clause and the Bankruptcy Clause and the commerce power all in the same breath. It was the same -- And do you -- because I read the erroneous dicta language -- maybe I'm misreading it, so you can tell me how -- as just a reference to the statements in Seminole Tribe about the Bankruptcy Clause. It's the same sentences, Justice Kagan.
It's the same exact portion of Seminole Tribe that dealt with all Article I clauses in the same breath. And, in fact, in Justice Stevens' dissent in -- I think it was the first footnote of it -- he noted that the Seminole Tribe decision by its terms would apply to the commerce -- would apply to the Copyright Clause and to the Bankruptcy Clause, and Justice Rehnquist, I think -- and Chief Justice Rehnquist, in Footnote 16, I think, engaged that assumption and said, yes, essentially, no big deal, but that is the necessary upshot of the Seminole Tribe holding as it was articulated by the Court. And that's why I think, in Katz, this Court had to deal right upfront with whether that assumption held or not, and it rejected it as erroneous. But, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Kagan, let me assure the Court there is no other clause in Article I like this one.
There is no other clause that is as pointed.
There is no other clause that contemplates that there will be private property rights -- But if you're -- What about -- -- if you're right -- if you are right, we would then have to go back to Florida Prepaid, right, and topple that rule? It would be certainly open to folks in patent cases to make that argument, Justice Kagan. But how -- how could -- how could we have the two rules going simultaneously? That would be my prediction.
My prediction is that, ultimately, the Patent Remedy Act would be revisited and properly upheld as a valid exercise -- exercise of Congress's Article I power. So, basically, you're asking us to overrule Florida Prepaid? I'm asking this Court to follow Katz, Justice Alito, where I think Florida Prepaid was overruled in relevant part and certainly -- You think Katz overruled Florida Prepaid? I think it -- it overruled -- it overruled the basis for Florida Prepaid.
The -- the precedential foundation for Florida Prepaid was solely the relevant portion of Seminole Tribe.
That's exactly what the Court was -- was, I think, calling erroneous -- erroneous dicta and rejected. So I take the holding of Katz to have totally undermined the foundation -- So you -- -- of Florida Prepaid. -- you think the state of the law is that every Article I, Section 8 power would have to be considered independently and Florida Prepaid may hold on for a while as a poorly reasoned exception to that rule but ultimately would have to be overruled to bring it in line with the position you're asking us to adopt today? I have only one friendly amendment to Your Honor's assumption, which is I don't think that there is any other Article I clause that reflects a plan of the convention waiver in the sense that we're discussing, in terms of the constitutional text and the necessary implications of it, because, for the reasons that this Court has already recognized, we think it is totally incompatible with the framers' text and the framers' contemplation to say that there's any such thing as an exclusive private property right secured by the United States Congress that states are free to infringe without pay.
I think that would have been antithetical to the framers' conception. That's our respectful submission on Article I.
And if the Court doesn't have other questions about that, I'll move on to -- Well, do you think Florida Prepaid is subject to our usual stare decisis rules or not? Well, Justice Kavanaugh, obviously, the Court will decide what is its precedent.
We read Florida Prepaid as not having really squarely addressed this question. I don't think Florida Prepaid reached a holding on the Article I point because the question was not before the Court there. Well, the Court said the Patent Remedy Act cannot be sustained under either the Commerce Clause or the Patent Clause.
Before that, it said Seminole Tribe makes clear that Congress may not abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to its Article I powers. It said that without the question having been presented and without any party arguing the question, which is why I -- I would respectfully question whether it's truly a holding, Justice Kavanaugh. But, if it was a holding, it was, just as Your Honor articulated it, based solely on Seminole Tribe, the very same aspect of Seminole Tribe that we read the Court as revisiting and overruling in Katz.
But the Court will decide the status of its precedent.
If it has any qualms about the Article I basis for the CRCA, I would ask the Court to sustain the CRCA on the strength of the -- Could you tell me -- -- Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment basis. -- can you articulate what ""plan of the convention"" means to you? I know what it means in Katz.
And -- and they look to a textual foothold, the ability of -- ability of habeas courts to grant relief to state prisoners.
So that's a clear intrusion on states. I don't see the same thing in the intellectual property provision.
In fact, for 200 years, there was concurrent state and federal jurisdiction.
That seems to cut against your argument that somehow the founders thought that this was an exclusive federal right. Take those in turn, Justice Sotomayor. Or exclusively, an exclusive right to the federal government. A plan of the convention waiver refers to some reflection that states were surrendering their back-dropped default sovereign immunity in a discrete respect as part of the constitutional convention -- You don't think -- -- and what came out of it. -- that exclusive jurisdiction would have signaled that more clearly -- I -- -- than concurrent jurisdiction for over 200 years? I think that our textual basis for the abrogation is stronger than it was in Katz.
In Katz, as you say, Your Honor, I -- I don't think it was in the Bankruptcy Clause, the plan of the convention waiver. And as to habeas jurisdiction, that was not about monetary relief against states. That was not about hauling states into federal court.
It was just about granting relief, habeas relief, to get prisoners out of state prison. I -- I don't think that that's anywhere near as on point as what you have with the intellectual property clause, where clearly the framers' contemplation is these are exclusive rights that anyone who may infringe has to pay for. Congress's job is to secure those rights.
It cannot do that without abrogating state sovereignty -- Well, you're assuming -- -- within this discrete realm. -- the latter part you're assuming.
Nothing about it -- it says securing the copyright, but it doesn't say making sure that the copyright owners are paid. To promote progress. Number one -- To promote progress, Justice Sotomayor.
It is a preamble that is not echoed anywhere else in Article I. Some would say that injunctive relief promotes progress. Well, James Madison -- That's a damages question.
That's not a -- an issue of what promotes the arts. James Madison's conception reflected in the text of what the monopoly would achieve is that the authors and inventors would get paid for their inventions. They would get paid for their creations. And as the Court, as I indicated, back in 1888 recognized, it is antithetical to that to say that government of any kind, certainly the federal government, can infringe those exclusive rights that -- that Congress is to be securing. But, as to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor, this is a case and a legislative record different from what the Court had before it in Florida Prepaid. It is much stronger in relevant part. In part, that's because of the fundamental difference between copyright law at issue in this case and patent law that the Court was looking at in Florida Prepaid. In part, it's also because you have a legislative record that is so much stronger, Your Honors.
You had the Register of Copyrights, Ralph Oman, testifying to Congress, preparing a report based on a 50-state survey, and in -- a -- a very conscientious compilation of comments and studies about what was happening in federal copyrights and why this legislation was necessary to protect them. But you tell us in your brief that when Congress enacted the CRCA it had ""16 examples over the previous decade of reported state infringement in 13 states."" Is -- is that enough to identify a serious constitutional problem? I think so, Justice Alito.
I think, first of all, as to this serious constitutional problem, you have federal property rights that are -- have been granted and that are private property rights, and states are infringing without paying for them. That is a fundamental intrusion.
That is a fundamental constitutional problem.
And I think Congress, if it has a remedy that is conscientiously tailored around that, should have, as the Court put it in City of Boerne -- Sixteen examples is not enough.
And the -- the mere fact that there were -- that there were state infringements doesn't necessarily mean that there were state violations of a constitutional right, does it? We think it follows in the copyright context, Justice Alito. Every -- every infringement is a violate -- every infringement by a state or by the federal government is a constitutional violation? The nature of the exclusive intellectual property right is that one will have the right respected or else be compensated for an intrusion.
That is the nature of intellectual property. And for copyright in particular, Justice Alito, infringement by definition means someone has copied the protected original expression of the copyright holder.
And, yes, we think that that is a constitutional violation pretty much every time. But what if it's negligent? I don't think it -- Justice Alito, I don't think it can be negligent in a relevant sense. The -- the -- the -- the government may permit procedural due process violations by doing all sorts of things negligently, denying notice, denying opportunity to be heard, a spurious welfare cancellation.
Those things offend procedural due process.
But there's also a takings basis for this legislation.
And the Court has been very clear that a taking can occur even through a regulatory taking, as in Penn Central. And so, if there is a predictable result of a government action that denies someone their protected property rights and does that without compensation, that is a Fourteenth Amendment problem. I submit that that's true in every case, but it's certainly true in most cases. And the Court's been very clear that Congress has prophylactic and deterrent rights under its Section 5 power. And I would also note, as to the 16 examples that we're talking about, those examples are really in the nature of reports, Justice Alito. So one of those reports was from the Motion Picture Association of America, which said that films were being shown by state prison authorities widely. And when that was pointed out to multiple states, two of those states came back and said, we're going to stand on our Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. One of those is North Carolina, one of those states.
That's one of the episodes that was reported. And just two other points about this. The report from Ralph Oman came in 1988.
That was three years after the Court's decision in Atascadero.
So the register was clear, the former register was clear, and the Congress was clear that this was an emerging problem, and what they had in the way of examples was within a three-year band of time. But do you think that record is stronger than the record in City of Boerne? Your Honor, I think the intrusion here is much lighter than in City of Boerne. Here, all that states are being held to substantively is the same rule they've been under since the founding: Don't infringe copyrights.
Everyone agrees that that is an obligation of the states. Well, that may be true, but the question is, is there greater congruence and proportionality here than there was in City of Boerne, or maybe that we should reexamine City of Boerne too? That's a -- I'm not urging that. It's a -- okay. I'm -- I'm not urging that, and I don't think the Court needs to reexamine that because there isn't the same sort of congruence and proportionality problem. Part of what was at issue I think in City of Boerne, and rightfully concerned the Court, is Congress was redefining the substantive law.
It was intruding upon the substantive conduct of states and basically changing the substantive rules of what would constitute a constitutional violation. That's not what you have here, respectfully, Justice Alito.
This is Congress looking at something that is a cardinal sin.
It is states infringing federal copyrights, protected federal property. And it's -- it's enacting a remedy that is precisely tailored to that.
States have to pay what any private infringer would pay. States have to pay what they would insist an infringer of their protected copyrights pay. That's all Congress was doing in the CRCA.
And I don't think that there should be the same sort of empirical scepticism on the Court's part, especially given the fact that Congress was so clear about why the problem was newly emerging and why, to use the words that are found in the legislative record, this was just the tip of the iceberg, because copyright holders, small businesses, individual authors, did not have the means, did not have the incentives to be going to court and reporting instances of deprivation. You -- you said it was inevitably intentional copying.
But North Carolina says that it used the copyrighted works only for educational purposes and it got that right from the settlement that the parties reached. So that sounds like North Carolina is saying, we -- we -- far from intentionally copying, we thought we were just carrying out the rights we had under the settlement agreement. Your Honor, that's what they say.
Of course, we're here on a complaint. We're here on a motion to dismiss that was granted.
And -- and we are entitled to have all inferences drawn in favor of the allegations of the complaint. And if Your Honor looks at the settlement agreement, it's very clear that it needed -- there needed to be watermarks and timestamps that were on North -- on any images that North Carolina might use.
That was not on the images that they were using. When copyright infringement was pointed out to them and they were caught red handed with that, they returned to infringement. The infringement kept up even after the filing of the lawsuit.
That's in the complaint too. Blackbeard's law was then passed by North Carolina to make sure that they could get out from under the settlement agreement and they could basically get off the hook for liability for their infringement.
That, too, is in the complaint.
That's a defense that North Carolina raised in a parallel state court suit.
They pointed to Blackbeard's law to basically evade any liability for their copyright infringement. And so, if you look at the complaint, I'd point the Court to paragraphs 73 through 75 and to paragraph 80, it is explicit that these were intentional uncompensated infringements by the state and that they were unconstitutional in violating both the Fourteenth Amendment and the takings clause.
And that's -- Mr. Shaffer -- please. I'm sorry, Justice Kagan.
I was just going to say under the rationale that the Court articulated in U.S. v. Georgia, Tennessee v. Lane, at the very least it should be open to my clients to be able to proceed on this complaint and show that there was something unconstitutional here, Justice Alito -- How -- -- and the CRCA is valid as to that.
Sorry, Justice Kagan. How -- how do we figure out how much is enough in a legislative record? You said these 16 instances are enough. In Florida Prepaid, I believe there were eight instances, and we said that wasn't enough. Now what's the difference between the two -- I think that -- -- other than eight, you know? -- part of it is the fundamental difference between patents and copyrights.
In -- in Florida Prepaid, the Court's dealing with a body of law where states can be totally innocent in their infringement. They could independently arrive at an invention, they could have no awareness that anyone else came first, you're still going to be liable for patent infringement. Copyright law by definition is much more circumscribed.
For there to be infringement, it requires that a state have -- have copied the original expression of someone else.
Absent that, we're not talking about a copyright violation. Yeah, because you could look at 16 as a really low number.
There are 50 states, and if 16 of them infringed once, that gets you to 16.
That wouldn't strike me as a major national problem. It was reported -- there were 16 reports oftentimes of multiple instances of infringement or bad-faith conduct by states. That's encompassed within the 16 that we're referring to. And as to that, there were dozens of comments that were received about is this a bigger problem, is this an increasing problem? And Congress, per the Register, found that, yes, it was. And it might be different, Justice Kagan, if there were 16 examples after three decades had passed, but the reality is Congress saw the tip of the iceberg of this problem.
It saw something that was growing quickly and said this is a serious problem for the Fourteenth Amendment; we're going to put remedies in place in order to stop it, in order to deter it. And you have from the amici on our side a whole chorus of industry associations, including the Chamber of Commerce, including the Copyright Alliance, the way that this iceberg has grown much, much bigger. But how -- Congress was exactly right. -- do we think about that? Because a lot of that is not in the record.
Do we close our eyes to that? Do we act like a trial court with respect to those sorts of facts? What do we do? You have a clear rationale from Congress in the record, which is that there was a newly emerging problem and a tip of the iceberg, and Congress wanted to ward it off, Justice Kagan. And perhaps in a case like City of Boerne, the Court might be skeptical as to whether this was a good-faith, sound prediction by Congress or whether it was paranoia or whether it was pretextual. I think the Court should be heartened here, Justice Kagan, by the fact that exactly what Congress feared would come to pass has come to pass over and over and over again.
And there's a one-sided chorus on this.
It just confirms the reality and the soundness of Congress's prediction. Why hasn't there -- after Florida Prepaid, why -- why -- why do you think -- why has there not been, have not been, many, many instances in which states decide, well, look at all this text stuff, it's fabulous, we'll just copy all the patents? Why not? Justice Breyer, there has been a lot -- I mean, there has been a lot of that.
And you have that from the amici.
And I think it's also influenced licensing entities. All over California. Why doesn't California have a budget problem? We'll just take all the Silicon Valley material and -- and we'll copy it. If you read from Dow Jones -- I -- I committed to -- They're doing it? Your Honor, that's what they did tens of thousands of times over with -- I'm not talking about copyright.
I'm talking about patents. As to patents, I don't think that -- that states are in the patent business to the same extent, Justice Breyer.
I don't -- Why don't they -- why don't they -- here's the solution to all their budget problems? Well, maybe they're afraid that this Court might be there at the end of the day to answer unresolved questions after Florida Prepaid. What? What question? We apparently said they could go do it. Well, we think that there's still an Article I -- a question as to the Article I basis.
That's what we're respectfully urging.
And, certainly, Congress -- I, of course, dissented. (Laughter.) We -- I -- I know it well, Justice Breyer. Well, you -- what you say raises an interesting question under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
When we have decided that the -- the congressional record at the time of an enactment that attempts to rely on Congress's Section 5 power is insufficient, and in subsequent years there are events that would have made the record a lot stronger, what does that do to the decision? Does that -- does that mean that it's -- it's subject to reexamination based on what has happened after that point? So why should we look at events that occurred after the enactment of this? Because you've never looked at this legislative record before.
When you look at this legislative record, you find a predictive judgment by Congress that is a well-reasoned and logical and evidence-based predictive -- predictive judgment that this is a real phenomenon, it is emerging, it's being reported from multiple sources, it is quite concerning when you look at this from Fourteenth Amendment principles, among others. And so they decided to do what they did.
So that rationale is corroborated, Justice Alito.
There's a reality to it, a grounding that is evident in what has happened subsequent to that. And I think if the Court were to go, from our perspective, the wrong way in this case, the problem will get that much worse, because that will be taken as a green light for states to continue with their infringement without paying for it. So -- so can Congress say we're enacting this under Section 5 and we recognize that there's not much of a record of state violations at this point, but we predict that there is going to be? If -- if the remedy is sufficiently well tailored around the constitutional deprivation, my answer to that is yes, Justice Alito.
I think we are stronger than that.
But to take U.S. -- to take Tennessee v. Lane and U.S. v. Georgia, there, the Court was looking at essentially what are the facts of specific cases or a specific set of cases and saying from the Court's perspective, yes, this would violate the Constitution, therefore, the remedy is constitutional as to those separate cases. But I didn't understand you to be making an argument under U.S. versus Georgia.
Am I wrong? You're making an as-applied argument to this particular case? I think it's on North Carolina to make an as-applied challenge, Justice Alito.
Our respectful submission is that the CRCA is constitutional as enacted by Congress and as relied upon by us in this case. And if North Carolina wants to argue that it is an unconstitutional application as to them, it's their burden to do so. And we support the arguments of our amici that say the Court could ultimately decide this case under a U.S. v. Georgia or a Tennessee v. Lane rationale.
I'm urging the Court, in the first instance, simply to uphold the CRCA the way that Congress enacted the CRCA and envisioned for it to be applied. But you didn't make below the -- any -- at least I didn't see an argument based on U.S. v. Georgia. We didn't, I think, cite U.S. v. Georgia.
I think that is true, Justice Ginsburg.
We do rely upon the arguments of our amici, and I stand by my submission to Your Honors that if anyone is -- is trying to argue that the CRCA is unconstitutionally applied in this case, it's North Carolina. And the Court can decide, as it decides so often when it comes to facial challenges, that the CRCA is not facially unconstitutional, but it could be open to states in an appropriate case to make the as-applied challenge. You've done a very nice job of showing in your papers -- the Blackbeard law does trouble me deeply, but you're doing nothing with proving the proportionality to the problem because there are states that presumably have fine remedies to handle any infringement. You've shown some failings in this state's processes, but I don't know how any of the evidence developed by Congress shows that all 50 states and territories additionally don't have adequate state systems to address this issue. If I may answer the question, Mr. Chief Justice. Briefly. Very briefly, Justice Sotomayor.
Number one, in -- in the legislative record, the House report at -- committee report at 9 and 10, the House emphasized how important copyright damages are, specifically statutory damages and attorneys' fees.
It's the difference between loss of the right and -- and protection of the right.
That's how important it is. And, of course, the copyright statute preempts any equivalent state laws.
So there is no recourse for the copyright holder who's complaining specifically of copyright deprivation outside of the CRCA. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Park. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: State sovereign immunity is a fundamental feature of our Constitution's structure.
As this Court has repeatedly reaffirmed, immunity from private lawsuits seeking money damages was inherent in the nature of sovereignty at the founding and remains today. As the -- and the Constitution preserves this aspect of state sovereignty unless there's compelling evidence that the states surrendered it when they ratified a particular constitutional provision. And my friend has failed to identify any historical evidence that anyone at the founding remotely contemplated that the intellectual property clause would allow for damages lawsuits against states.
In fact, it was not until the 1970s, nearly two centuries after the first Copyright Act, that a federal court ever awarded damages of this kind. Now Mr. Allen seeks to portray this settled state of affairs as somehow anomalous, but nothing could be further from the case.
All of Congress's general law-making powers are subject to limits found elsewhere in the Constitution, including limits that protect state sovereignty. And so Congress could not commandeer state legislatures and force them to pass copyright protective laws, nor could they, under separation of powers principles, vest judicial review of copyright claims in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
And, likewise, state sovereign immunity limits Congress's authority to expose state treasuries to the Copyright Act's exorbitant financial remedies. And for that reason too, the Act cannot be justified under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Copyright infringement rarely rises to a constitutional violation at all, let alone pose the kind of serious constitutional threat that allows for expansive remedies like abrogation. And liability under the Act is expansive.
It's vastly greater than anything required by the Due Process Clause.
It includes statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringement, even if the plaintiff cannot prove she suffered any actual harm. And it creates a strict liability regime that covers negligent and even innocent infringement, even though, of course, only deliberate property deprivations can violate the Constitution.
And these concerns are far from theoretical. The First Circuit has affirmed a $675,000 judgment against a college student for sharing online a few copyrighted songs, sending him into bankruptcy.
And the due process concern that is ordinarily raised in a copyright damages lawsuit is whether they're constitutionally excessive, not -- What is there that I can go to the same question, a wonderful money-raising thing.
What the state decides to do with its own website, charging $5 or something, is to run Rocky, Marvel, whatever, Spider-Man, and perhaps Groundhog Day, all right? (Laughter.) Now, great idea. Several billion dollars flows into the treasury. Okay? Now, if you win, why won't that happen? And, by the way, if you're writing to the constitutional convention, you're a member, okay, and you write these words, copyright is to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for a limited time to authors -- and to authors, the exclusive right to their respective writings. But, of course, California decides that the person who wrote Rocky, Marvel, et cetera, will unfortunately receive nothing because everyone will have seen it on the state's own streaming device. All right.
What is your response to that? So there are two important separate issues at issue there, and I'll start with the text.
So the exclusive right is -- well, sovereign immunity does not invade the exclusive right. So I think that that hypothetical misunderstands, respectfully, the role of sovereign immunity in our constitutional system. As this Court said in Alden, states are not relieved of their binding obligation to comply with federal law. And the ordinary remedy required under the Constitution when a sovereign violates federal rights is an injunction and not money damages. Oh, it's -- by the way, we ran it yesterday.
You can have your injunction.
Do you see my point? Yes, exactly.
Well, so I agree that under sovereign immunity, as a necessary consequence, there will be hard cases where, you know, statutory violations are not remedied, but that, I think, the important understanding that the founders had is that when you sue a sovereign, on the opposite side of the judgment are the people and the people's money. And so the entire point of sovereign immunity, as this Court said in Lewis just a few terms ago, is to protect state governments and allow them to make their own choices as to how to spend scarce -- There are not going to be -- -- government resources. -- there are not going to be hard cases.
There are going to be easy cases. Well -- And it's not -- and Justice Breyer's point is that it could be rampant, states ripping off copyright holders. And how is that -- how can that be squared with the exclusive right, if states can do this, which presumably a ruling in your favor will do nothing but encourage them to do? So I think that's the beauty of the Copyright Remedy Act, combined with this Court's Georgia decision.
So, on extreme hypotheticals, such as Justice Breyer outlined -- Why is it extreme? You've said hard cases and now extreme.
Why won't it just be a standard case and not so extreme? Well, so whenever a plaintiff can reasonably allege that there has been intentional copyright infringement and there are not adequate remedies, then, under this Court's Georgia decision, they can bring a direct constitutional claim.
We don't dispute that. And so I think, to the extent that the Georgia issue is relevant here at all, it's to the fact that it relieves many of these concerns that, Justice Breyer and Justice Kavanaugh, you've outlined.
I think that -- well, so, if we were to discuss the Georgia issue here, I think we have been here litigating this case against Mr. Allen for four years, and the first time that he ever raised this Georgia issue of a direct constitutional challenge was in his reply brief in this Court. You won't see it in the petition.
You won't see it in his briefs below or in the transcripts of the argument.
And, of course, for that reason, the lower courts never addressed it.
They never -- Your view is that -- that, in fact, under the Fourteenth Amendment, this statute is valid insofar as my Captain Marvel example deliberately takes property from people.
So is that what your point is? Yes, if the -- All right.
If that's your point, then you concede their point, whether they raised it or not, somebody else would, you concede that this legislation is valid.
You're just saying it only applies to instances where the state deliberately takes Captain Marvel. That would cure my problem to a considerable degree, but that is the concession on your part? I think it follows naturally from this Court's Georgia decision, but I would add one additional element, which is, to complete a due process violation for a deprivation of property, two additional features are required; you need to be deliberate and there needs to be no alternative remedy. And, here, there are other alternative remedies that could be available. Let -- let's take deliberate first.
So it is alleged that North Carolina is infringing on copyright, copyrighted works.
There's a settlement.
And then North Carolina starts up doing exactly the same thing that it did before the first.
That sounds pretty intentional to me. I think it would be intentional if the State had not explicitly bargained for a provision that says we can use Mr. Allen's images for non-commercial purposes. And now I think that that highlights how this dispute is really a dispute over the scope of a contractual license that the State received.
There is a pending breach of contract lawsuit in state court where the State and Mr. Allen's business partner, Intersal, are debating these exact facts, whether we've exceeded the scope of our license by, for example, not putting watermarks on the images and that sort of thing.
So I think that relieves -- Do -- I'm sorry, finish. I just was going to point out as well that I think that relieves any actual due process violation that could be here because, of course, there's -- the alternative remedy is a breach of contract lawsuit, which we have not asserted sovereign immunity for.
We've affirmatively waived our immunity in state court for breach of contract claims. What do I do with the Blackbeard law? It is deeply troubling. It's a state saying, even if I'm infringing, you can't get anything.
That's basically how I read that law. What remedies do they have under federal law for a state doing something like that? So I agree it's a strange law.
I think there are two separate points I'd like to make. So, first, it can't possibly have any relevance to this lawsuit because it was passed in 2015, two years after the alleged infringements in question.
And it was -- Well, it could to a Georgia argument, obviously. Well, so I think -- and I think that exposes the second issue, which is that there are -- there are two types of claims in this complaint.
There are -- there's a copyright infringement claim and related claims, and there's a declaratory judgment claim asking that that law be declared preempted. Now Mr. Allen has not sought cert on the declaratory judgment claim, and that would be the remedy in that circumstance.
But the district court -- sorry, the Fourth Circuit -- and this is on pages 37 to 39 of the Petition Appendix -- the Fourth Circuit rejected the declaratory judgment claim because it held that the 2013 settlement agreement said that your -- your images, Mr. Allen, are subject to the public records law, and the 2013 version of the law said that photographs that the state receives in public business are public records. And so that amendment couldn't possibly have affected Mr. Allen's rights to his images. So why wasn't it a taking? Why wasn't the passage of that law a taking when -- when the law declares that something that is private property is now a public record? So I think it possibly could be on different facts, if Mr. Allen hadn't already agreed in the contract that his images were public records, but I think that this would be a pretty extraordinary vehicle for this Court to decide when copyright infringement can constitute a taking. I'm not aware of any federal court that has ever reached that question because it hasn't been litigated.
He never alleged that the use of the images was a taking below.
He mentions it in his brief here, but he doesn't even describe the substantive standards that would apply under either a direct physical invasion analysis or a Penn Central deprivation of economic value analysis. And so I think that the images here could not possibly be a taking because the question here is whether our display of a handful of images in a few educational videos and a museum nonprofit newsletter constituted a complete deprivation of economic value.
Surely, it wasn't physical occupation of those images. And so I don't think the takings clause is relevant here. Well, what about Section 5, Mr. Park? Congress clearly wanted to abrogate the state sovereign immunity, so what would it have had to have done in your view in order to do that successfully? I think that it should have followed the rules laid out by this Court in City of Boerne and subsequent cases.
And I think that, to be in all fairness to Congress, those decisions postdated the statute here. And so they weren't even trying to meet those standards.
And it is an unfortunate consequence, but this Court -- What would a record that does meet those standards, what would it look like? So it would be trained on identifying copyright infringement that also violated the Constitution.
So it would be intentional infringement, and it would be infringement where there's no alternative remedy. Well, can't Congress say something like in copyright, you know, any violation requires actual copying? So we're going to assume that 80 percent of the violations in the world are intentional? So I think that that would activate the danger that this Court designed the City of Boerne test to prevent, which is changing the substance of law under Section 5. Now, under copyright law, that willful infringement is a recognized -- Whoa -- -- standard. -- whoa, whoa, whoa. Because there's clearly some allowance for Congress to devise prophylactic rules, and this would seem to be a perfect example of like, you know what, given the requirements of a copyright violation, we think the vast majority of them are going to be intentional and, therefore, are going to be constitutional violations. Are you saying Congress can't say that and just target copyright violations generally? I think that they could.
I think, on a different record, if they had focused on intentional infringement and said, you know, this is widespread, there are no adequate alternative remedies, this is a serious national constitutional problem, and -- and we will enact prophylactic remedies to address this. Well, how do they show that? Well, I think, at the very least, they focused on intentional infringement. I would direct the Court to Mr. -- I think I just talked about that. Right. They've decided that 80 percent of copyright violations are intentional because copyright violations always involve actual copying.
It's hard to actually copy something negligently. Yeah -- Not impossible, but hard.
So -- so Congress has decided, you know, the vast majority of these are intentional, therefore, are constitutional violations.
Now what does Congress have to do? So I think there would be the additional analysis, which is the proportionality prong of the test, which requires that there be some tailoring of the remedies that are given by Congress to what is required by the Due Process Clause. And no one has ever claimed -- I'm not aware of any copyright holder that has ever claimed that the exorbitant remedies found in the Copyright Act are required by due process. I mean, we're talking about $150,000 per infringement even for an infringement where the plaintiff says I cannot prove any actual damages, but because this infringement was so egregious on its merits, I deserve statutory damages. Here, as I -- I see the problem, which you've clarified very much for me, it's that the choice for us now is, say, your view would be that -- that states can copy without doing anything unless that copying violates the Due Process Clause.
And in that respect, you agree that the statute can be upheld. Now, if we accept your view, we've got to decide how copyright, copying, and the Due Process Clause fit together, which, to my knowledge, this Court hasn't really gone into. And it sounds like a pretty good mare's nest. Now the other view would be -- you'd lose, which you don't want to do -- (Laughter.) -- but the other view would be it's likely that there are enough cases where it would violate the Due Process Clause for us to accept the statute as a whole, thereby creating in a sense another somewhat different exception to the statement in Florida Prepaid. I'm trying to get our issue, and I'm trying to say it fairly from your point of view and from the other point of view. So -- so let me clarify in terms of your first construct.
I don't think that's actually accurate, so under copyright law, a whole range of copying doesn't violate the Copyright Act at all, when there's fair use that applies, when, as here, it's contractually authorized.
And so an additional element is required for that to be considered intentional. And copyright law -- law has a built-in set of standards here. What Nimmer says and what the Second Circuit says, what is fairly well accepted in the lower courts is that willful infringement is when the -- the -- the defendant has actual knowledge that their act constitutes copyright infringement. Now there is some dispute as to whether recklessness -- as to whether it constitutes copyright infringement is enough, but I -- I'm not aware of any court that has ever said that the intentionality requirement, as is sometimes relevant in copyright law, is ever met by mere copying. In fact, you know, 504(c)(2) of the Copyright Act says ""innocent infringement is still liable."" And ""innocent"" is defined as when the defendant had no reason to be aware that the infringement was -- Do you think Congress is able to make judgments about what proportion of copyright violations are indeed intentional? If -- if Congress had said, given the requirement of actual copying, we think a vast majority of copyright infringements are intentional, would that be precluded? Would that -- would that fall within Congress's power or not? Yes, I think that Congress warrants a great deal of deference in this area. And so, if they had conducted that examination and they had made that conclusion in a finding or it was clear in the legislative record that that was what Congress was focusing on -- So do you think that's what Congress has to do here? Congress has to say, we think most copyright violations are indeed intentional and therefore violate due process? And here there are 30 examples, would that be enough? I don't -- I don't believe that there is a strict numerical threshold that is required to legislate under Section 5.
I think that what City of Boerne says is that the remedy has to be tailored to the scope of the constitutional violation.
Right? So, if there were 30 violations, then Congress could say, well, here's a proportional remedy to that level of -- Well, why isn't the proportional remedy the same remedy that everybody else has to pay? Because -- I mean, once Congress has decided that we think that there are loads of constitutional violations going on, why doesn't the state have to pay what every other actor would have to pay when it engages in those constitutional violations? Why isn't that almost sort of, by definition, proportional? That's what people pay. It would be proportional to the -- the Copyright Act, but Section 5 has to be focused on enforcing the Due Process Clause, and the Due Process Clause only requires at most compensatory relief. And so I think that that exposes how my friend on the other side is trying to constitutionalize copyright law.
What we're talking about is the Due Process Clause and what that requires, and not ordinary infringement. But it's both you and your friend, because what you will have the courts doing is, case by case, when -- when, say, California tries to run -- they won't run Captain Marvel, maybe it's some old movie, you know, and they say it's fair use.
And we can think of millions -- I'm -- not a million, but thousands of examples. And case by case, when someone tries to stop them, the courts have to decide whether the Due Process Clause in this instance, where the University of California thought it was fair use to make 50,000 copies of Norman Mailer's book or something, you know, you say case by case, we have to decide the constitutional question. I think that's what -- where -- where -- where you're leaving me.
And it's -- it's -- it's tough.
It's tough sort of both ways. Well, so I don't think that's going -- going to be difficult for the lower courts to -- to wade through that state of the law because they're merely applying the ordinary rules of copyright. So willful infringement, we think, would constitute intentional infringement.
And they merely assess whether alternative remedies are available, and that is something that courts are very well equipped to do, to decide whether an alternative claim would be meritorious. Now one other alternative remedy that no one disputes here is that they could try to sue the individual officers personally.
Of course, we wouldn't like that at all, but I think the settled state of the law, at least in the lower courts, is that copyright infringement claims can be sued -- can be brought against individual state -- But they won't -- -- employees. -- have the same deep pocket that the state has. Let me ask one aspect of this question, Mr. Park.
States can hold copyrights. They can be copyright holders.
And they can sue anybody in the world for infringement.
There's something unseemly about a state saying, yes, we can hold copyrights and we can hold infringers to account to us, but we can infringe to our heart's content and be immune from any compensatory damages. Could Congress say -- condition the copyright privileges that states have by saying, States, we're going to allow you to copyright works, but the price is you have to be fair to the other side so that when you are infringing, you'll be liable? Could -- does Congress have Article I authority to do that? So I don't think that they could do that because I think that would be an unconstitutional condition.
It would be a hard case that this Court would probably decide. But what they could do to bring the parties into parity would be to say that, States, you can't hold copyrights at all.
The states have never claimed a constitutional entitlement to be able to hold copyrights.
The United States Government can't hold copyrights. What it has done is as a matter of statute, and this is an interpretation of the 1909 Copyright Act, where because Congress said, United States, you can't hold copyright -- copyrights, courts have said, well, that implies that states can hold copyrights. But I think that they would be within their rights to -- to remove that right and remove that anomaly. Counsel, just to get back to your statement that all you have to do is sue the state officers, you -- you'd certainly reimburse the officer, wouldn't you? Yes, that's -- that's correct. So is that all they have to do, just name the officer, rather than the state, in their infringement action? Well, I think that -- so, yes, that most states would reimburse their state officers if -- if it was within the scope of their employment, and that there would be additional hurdles in that kind of case. Qualified immunity would apply. And qualified immunity applied in this case, and that's why the -- the claims were dismissed against the individual officers. Well, then it's not much of a -- it's not much of a response to say, well, you can sue the officer. Again -- It gets thrown out right away, but you can still sue him.
So that's a reason not to hold the state liable? Well, I think it is in this context and -- and here's why, because intentionality under the Due Process Clause is roughly equivalent to the qualified immunity analysis. That's what this Court said in Kingsley versus Hendrickson, that it's -- intentionality is judged by an objective standard under all the facts and circumstances available to the officer, is what they did, can that be construed as intentional.
That's very similar to the qualified immunity analysis, and I think it mirrors what the Fourth Circuit did here where it says, well, there's this contract. It's a little bit ambiguous.
It's not clear whether this is -- these are non-commercial uses. But we won't say that what they did was intentional, when a reasonable officer would read that contract and say, well, I think that educational videos and a museum newsletter are commercial -- non-commercial uses and so they're covered by the contract. Mr. Park, can I take you back to the -- the interesting suggestion that perhaps Congress could have justified what it did in this act by saying that we predict that a high percentage of copyright infringements are intentional and, therefore, violate due process. If we were to accept that, is there any reason why the same reasoning would not apply in patent litigation? No, I don't believe there is any -- any distinction there.
And I -- I think that that highlights how -- I don't think that that is actually what Congress could do if it didn't match the -- this Court's jurisprudence or at least the jurisprudence of the lower federal courts. If the lower federal courts have not said that most copyright infringement is intentional, it's the rare exception that infringement is held to be willful. And -- and so I think that it would be based on the legislative record.
You'd evaluate whether Congress had a good-faith basis for making that conclusion.
And I -- I think on the current state of the law, as I understand it, they would not have that good-faith basis. So I'd like to just turn very quickly to this idea that future infringement could be enough or that these, you know, examples that have arisen after the copy -- the Copyright Remedy Act could be relevant to this analysis. I think that that would be at odds with all of this Court's Section 5 cases, including the cases where this Court has upheld abrogations as valid, such as Hibbs.
In all of those cases, they said Congress must identify a widespread pattern of constitutional violations and in the legislative record before it. And I think that that goes to the heart of the entire -- of the City of Boerne test, which is evaluating Congress's work and making sure they're not trying to change constitutional law through Section 5.
They -- they have -- they have to be enforcing the law as interpreted by this Court. I think -- if I can make just a few words on stare decisis, because I think that's incredibly important in this case.
I think that my friend has acknowledged that a ruling in his favor, at least on Article I, would effectively overrule Florida Prepaid, that there would be some interesting law review articles written about whether it did so on its own merits or whether there has to be subsequent litigation or whether it automatically revived the -- the Act. But no one that has ever evaluated the intellectual property clause has been -- ever been able to identify any distinction between copyrights and patents that could be relevant to this analysis. And so, yes, if this Court rules on the basis of Article I, we think that -- that Florida Prepaid would be overruled. And I don't think that Katz can -- can bear the weight that Mr. Shaffer tries to place on it.
So Katz -- and this is at page 363 of Katz -- it says, ""our assumptions about the Bankruptcy Clause were erroneous."" And I think that that was a reasonable thing for Congress -- for this Court to say, given that there had been nearly a century of precedent, going all the way back to 1933 in New York versus Irving Trust, saying that bankruptcy discharge proceedings -- You said the blanket statement in Seminole Tribe was incorrect and Florida Prepaid relied on that same blanket statement in Seminole Tribe.
It seems to be a problem for that blanket statement in Florida Prepaid. Yes, I -- I completely agree.
I think that the reasoning of Florida Prepaid's Article I holding has been undercut and that would be a reason to revisit -- It's two sentences. That's correct, Your Honor. It's very limited.
And it's based on a principle that has been undermined by Katz.
I think -- so you would apply the ordinary rules of stare decisis.
That's the only point here. Not that it has not been undermined in any respect. And I think if you view this question in terms of the principles that stare decisis is supposed to uphold, you know, legal stability, reliance on this Court's decisions, that that would really bring this issue into focus, because everyone who has evaluated Florida Prepaid and whose job it is to evaluate this Court's rulings and say what are my legal rights and obligations has said that it covers both the Copyright Remedy Act and the Patent Remedy Act, including the United States Government, which has -- I just -- I really don't follow your reliance argument.
Yes, the state may be relying, but who other than the state relies on the state's right to infringe without damage liability, who other than the state? I -- I think that I am speaking about the state's reliance interests, for the states generally.
And I think here is why that matters, and I would bring it back to this case. So the -- our Cultural Resources Department is operating on a shoestring budget trying to recover and excavate and preserve the remaining aspects of the Queen Anne's revenge, around 40 percent of which under their estimates is still on the bottom of the ocean. And they are doing that work.
And it's when there are competing legislative priorities, such as school funding and disaster relief, and all sorts of other more important priorities, it's hard to get money to fund important work like this for the state's history. I think, though, Mr. Park, what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, that it's not the strongest reliance argument to say we relied on this -- this Court's holding to infringe other people's rights. Not -- not to infringe on other people's rights.
I think that what they did here is that they posted online on good faith -- faith reliance on a contract.
It could have also been on fair -- on good-faith reliance and perhaps an aggressive reading of fair use in other situations, but they did that because they thought that they wouldn't have infringement liability of up to $150,000 per work. And there are -- you know, I can give legions of examples where juries have awarded astronomical copyright damages.
There was a jury in Minnesota that awarded $1.9 million against a single mother of four for downloading and sharing a few copyrighted images online, and the Eighth Circuit reduced that judgment to $220,000.
She still went bankrupt. But because these issues are ordinarily thought to be a due process problem on the other side, and so I think that you would see states retract from their uses of copyrighted works in a way that benefit the public. There is an amicus brief from the library association saying that this would imperil -- copyright infringement liability, monetary liability, would imperil digitization projects and other works of archives. And I think the states are simply different.
I -- I don't think it's respectful to the interests of state governments to say -- You can finish the sentence. -- that they will -- that they will infringe at will if damages liability is taken off the table. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Park. Four minutes, Mr. Shaffer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Starting with Blackbeard's law, Justice Sotomayor, I want to be clear, Blackbeard's law was passed after the allegations of infringement in -- in this case, after North Carolina had been caught infringing. It was then used, as -- as alleged in the complaint, by North Carolina to defend against the state court suit by Intersal because they said Blackbeard's law had voided the settlement agreement. It was now contrary to North Carolina's public policy and they couldn't be held to the settlement agreement, nor could they be held liable.
That's in the complaint.
That is as alleged, and I don't think there's any ability by the State in this posture to contradict those allegations. As to the Intersal dispute that Mr. Park talks about, in North Carolina State Court, Intersal does not hold the copyrights, so they're sued by definition.
It's not trying to vindicate the copyrights. That suit was just decided by the North Carolina Supreme Court after North Carolina for years interposed sovereign immunity defenses saying that the breach of contract action had not been properly filed administratively, there needed to be administrative exhaustion.
So that suit is continuing on.
It's not as though sovereign immunity was no impediment, and it's certainly not out to vindicate copyrights. As to the images in question, I just have to emphasize, Your Honor, my clients have put in two decades of work, essentially, trying to be there to ex- -- when these images are excavated underwater, at great expense, at great risk, and this is all essentially my clients get out of it, the copyrighted images. And the allegations of the complaint are that North Carolina, not once or twice but repeatedly and systematically, was infringing those copyrights, was caught doing it, paid $15,000 under the terms of the settlement agreement, went back to doing it.
Even after this complaint was filed, they continued to infringe the copyrights.
And the resolution by the Fourth Circuit is everything is dismissed. And as to injunctive relief, Justice Breyer, Congress found it provides no meaningful remedy in this context, different from the patent context, but it's all about getting paid for past damages in order for this to be a meaningful remedy. And in this case, the request for injunctive relief was thrown out.
Why? Because North Carolina did exactly what you articulated, Justice Breyer.
They said: Well, we've stopped infringing those images now that you've pointed it out in court.
We've taken those down.
What else have you got? And without benefit of discovery, the Fourth Circuit viewed that as the end of the request for injunctive relief.
And that's how it goes in copyright cases. Now, as to the notion that there could be individual suits against individual officers under 1983, you're exactly right, Chief Justice, qualified immunity is a defense in this context. I'd commend to the Court the Fourth Circuit's decision on this point.
It's at 37a, 39a.
They basically said, because there's some defense that's available to these officials, they say they read the settlement agreement differently, maybe they didn't know it was copyright infringement, maybe they weren't looking for the watermarks or the -- the time stamps, that is a good enough defense.
Qualified immunity gets them out of the case, and those claims, too, were dismissed. That's why it's so important, part of why it's so important, in copyright cases that there be secure remedies for copyright holders. That's true against states and it's true against anyone.
Most copyright holders, unlike patent holders, Justice Alito, these are small fish, they have not sunk costs into this sort of a registration. And they need to have secure statutory damages and attorneys' fees in order to come to court at all because, in copyright cases, as Congress found from the testimony before it and the -- and the submissions of the register, you need to have statutory damages.
Otherwise, how can you quantify what the harm was? And especially given how small the stakes are in copyright cases and how under-heeled most copyright plaintiffs are, if you don't have those statutory damages, you don't have a right.
And that is specifically found by Congress in the House report at pages 9 and 10. So, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked about what happens in ordinary cases.
This is exactly what Congress looked at.
They said the rule in copyright cases, absent the CRCA, is that copyright infringement pays for states.
They will get away with it every time.
You will not have copyright holders who have incentives and means and attorneys to bring suit.
That should not be the outcome in this case. And to say it, respectfully, that it's incumbent upon every copyright plaintiff who sues a state to prove a constitutional violation and willfulness in the way that Mr. Park articulates is to render the right nugatory and the CRCA as well. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1498, Atlantic Richfield versus Christian. Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves whether the hundreds of thousands of landowners on Superfund sites can bring state lawsuits to implement their own piecemeal hazardous waste cleanups. The answer should be no. CERCLA entrusts EPA to protect human health and the environment by developing a remedial plan that protects the whole community. Respondents are profoundly wrong that removing waste is always better than leaving it in place. Superfund sites contain extremely hazardous substances, lead, mercury, plutonium, to name a few.
Excavation, transportation, and disposal of these substances is risky not only to neighbors but the millions of people who live next door to Superfund sites.
Whether these risks are worth any benefits should be evaluated by EPA, not juries on an ad hoc basis. Since 2013, EPA has objected that Respondents' restoration remedy would thwart more than three decades of efforts -- of its efforts at the Anaconda site, including by digging up soil that EPA wants left undisturbed and by building miles of underground trenches that would affect an entire community's groundwater. This Court should reverse for three reasons.
First, Section 113 bars Respondents' challenge to EPA's remedy. Second, Section 122 bars Respondents from undertaking any remedial actions absent EPA's authorization. And, third, a restoration remedy is preempted because it would require Atlantic Richfield to effectuate the very cleanup that federal law prohibits the company from doing on its own, and a restoration remedy would prevent EPA from carrying out its statutory mandate to implement comprehensive cleanups. Ms. Blatt, I've been trying to unpackage this case in my own mind, and I start with the language of the statute.
I'm sorry.
I interrupted you. Finish. No, we're good. Okay. (Laughter.) I'm sorry. No. I am trying to figure out -- let's assume for the sake of argument that the remedial plan that the state court orders supplements, rather than contradicts, the EPA plan, that it was something in top of. I read the savings clauses to permit that.
It -- the savings clauses are very explicit that it's not displacing or intending to displace state law remedies for liability or for anything else. So, if these plans supplement, why would this part of Montana law be preempted? So, in terms of preemption, so it's quite emphatic to understand that Section 122(e)(6) and the over 20 administrative orders impose both a floor and a ceiling on the type of cleanup -- If I disagree that it's a ceiling -- Well -- -- if I think it's just a flaw -- a floor -- Sure. -- and that the EPA has the power to decide whether any plan can supplement its own -- Of course. -- where does that leave this argument? So you -- If -- if -- if -- if I believe -- Sure. -- that it's a -- it's a floor only, not a ceiling -- Uh-huh. -- that the EPA has the right to establish when a plan will be a ceiling, where does that leave this case? Okay.
So, in terms of conflict preemption, so we know that EPA would absolutely have to change federal law, which it could, to approve their plan.
So you're absolutely correct.
The EP -- I'm sorry. EP -- federal law requires a specific action level and a specific amount of dirt that can be dug and that no wall could be built.
If that happens, EPA -- At the moment? Yes.
And EPA can change it.
And this Court in Mensing said that courts do not withhold preemption based on the speculation that federal government may change the law.
And the law would have to be -- But it isn't the law, Ms. Blatt.
It's -- it's the EPA Superfund plan for this site.
The specific things that you mention are not in the law.
They are in the EPA's plan. And if the EPA said we permit what the landowners -- the -- the further cleanup the landowners want, we permit it or we permit what they want with certain modifications, if EPA says yes, then there's no preemption that I could see that would be involved in this case. So that's not correct because, when you said plan -- and maybe I misspoke -- the law is not a U.S. code law. It's a binding administrative order where Atlantic Richfield would incur massive penalties every day if it violated.
It's a law in terms of an administrative order that sets forth the plan. Now Atlantic Richfield cannot carry out that plan without massive fines and violating law.
In the order, it says undertaking any action without EPA's approval violates the order.
And under ordinary -- But suppose the EPA approves.
The EPA says what you want to do is okay with us, or at least, as was suggested in the briefing, part of what the landowners want is okay with EPA. So all of the pillars of their plan violate EPA's order.
And your supposition that EPA could approve it is just not the test under preemption.
The test under preemption is whether a party today could independently do under federal law what state law requires. And I mean by that, and what this Court in Mensing and Bartlett said, that means complying with state law duties without the government's assistance and permission. Well, Ms. Blatt, same kind of question, and maybe it goes to a bunch of your arguments.
I mean, look, if I were writing this statute, I would say it all goes to the EPA.
It's just -- you know, that's the sensible solution to have one party that makes all the rules in this. But I'm not writing the statute.
And the statute has three savings clauses in it, which -- which suggests that the states have a significant role in this.
And, in particular, one that says that the states get to impose additional liability or requirements with respect to the release of hazardous substances. And I guess, you know, one way into this is if I -- if -- if -- if we imagine that this was done not with a damages rule, but suppose the Montana legislature just said, you know what, this plan that the EPA has put in place, it requires arsenic at a certain level, and we think it would be better to lower that, and we don't really care that the EPA thinks that that would not be a good idea for health purposes, as well as for economic purposes; we think that that arsenic level should be lowered. Do you think that the state gets to do that? No, and Section 121 deals with this directly.
It spells out in like over 3,000 words how states can incorporate into EPA's, their plans, and EPA can override that state standard.
And it goes -- then states have the remedy to sue.
It's one of the exceptions under 113. And so -- and I think you're right that their position under the savings clause is that not only could state law say don't enact EPA's remedy because we hate it and do a different remedy, but state courts could order independent warring cleanups, you know, case by case, block by block, house by house.
And this Court, in the Abilene Cotton case and in the AT&T case, interpreted almost an identically worded savings clause and said you can't interpret those clauses to completely destroy other parts of the Act. And this would utterly destroy EPA's whole design under CERCLA. So -- so what -- what do they save then? I mean, the savings is all over this statute.
They have to save something.
What do they save that -- that states can do independently? So let -- let me be very clear how narrow our argument is.
They have four -- four claims of compensatory damages and punitive damages.
So typical state law claims for nuisance and whatever else they want to claim for damages is fine. The objection here is that the actual remedy orders Atlantic Richfield to pay Respondents to carry out their contrary plan and that Respondents under state law must actually implement the very plan that Atlantic Richfield would violate federal law. So this is a -- not only a challenge and not only its direct remedial action that has to be taken in violation of 122, but it's the only claim that would meet our standard of conflict preemption because it requires Atlantic Richfield to effectuate a violation of federal law, either whether they hire their own employees or whether they hire the plaintiff's employees and put a different hard hat or give them a different -- Ms. Blatt -- -- shovel. -- if -- if I have questions about what state law requires, because I -- I can't find anything in the state law that requires a damages remedy to be put in trust for the remediation, that's what the court below said.
I know that's what it said.
But I can't find any law that says that's what has to happen -- Uh-huh. -- number one. Number two, I can't find any state law requirement that the Petitioner has to prove that they're going to actually use the money they're awarded for the purposes that they claim.
So I'm very confused about the state law question. Yeah.
And I think that's all a fair question.
And -- If it is a fair question -- Yeah, I was going to answer it. -- why is it preempted, meaning why wouldn't I just remand this case and say you can't make -- you can't award damages unless the other side proves or the side claiming these damages proves that it can get EPA approval of whatever it wants to do, and that it will, in fact, only use that award for those purposes? Right.
So -- What's wrong with a ruling that's just that basic that says you can get more if you can prove the EPA will give you more, as simple as that? So you know -- What's wrong with that -- Sure. -- kind of opinion? So you took this case on the assumption -- and we cite it on page 16 of our reply brief -- all the places where the Respondent concedes, and the Montana Supreme Court expressly said, that this money has to be used to carry out the remedy.
And that's the way this case comes up. If you want to know the reason for Sunburst, it's because of the reason is personal.
So, if you own a property and love it so much and you don't have any damages, the whole point of the restoration remedy to avoid the windfall is you have to spend the money. So I'm quite confident that I'm accurately stating Montana law and that Respondents never argued to the contrary.
And in our reply brief, again, we cite all the concessions, including, I think, the opinion below in three places says the money has to go to a trustee and that money has to be spent on the cleanup. And I'm agreeing with you that key to the preemption argument is that under state law, they will be forced to carry out a remedy that would violate EPA's orders, these administrative orders, if we carried it out itself. So what's wrong with an opinion that we write that says what you're missing is the next step.
You have to be able to show that that remediation will be approved. Yeah.
So -- So, if -- if that's their burden, why do we need to go any further? So I -- two responses. So, right now, they don't have federal permission.
And under Section 122, you have to take federal -- I didn't say -- We're talking about -- -- they have to show that they will get EPA approval. And all I'm saying is you know today. Let me just make one other point as a practical matter.
This is not a case in its infancy.
It was cooked.
It was about to go to trial.
It was three weeks away from jury selection when the court got stayed. We know they're going to trial and the whole case is about whether a different remedy should be put on.
And we know under state law, because they've conceded it, that they have to carry out that remedy.
And we know they don't have EPA's permission. So you not only know two things.
You know, again, it's conceded that the remedy seeks something different, and it would require a change in federal law.
And you know they never got EPA's permission.
And I guess this is assuming we're not even getting -- The answer -- the answer, I think, is this right, to the question, which is a question I had, too, is that in order to bring an action where the result will be an order to do certain things, dig dirt or do physical things, if they are a potentially responsible party, they have to show not that EPA might approve it, but what it says is unless such remedial action, which is the reaction they're seeking, has been authorized by EPA. And you know today that -- It has not. -- not only has it not been, they never ask EPA. And, therefore, what we should do if you are right on the potentially responsible party is we should send it back and say they have to get that permission from EPA. And there is no need to answer the other questions.
Is that right or wrong? That's wrong and I disagree.
You already know today they don't have it.
And just as the case sits today, whether they could have brought some separate federal lawsuit after they asked EPA -- excuse me, state lawsuit, but you already know today that they never asked for it. Yeah.
That's why I say we'd send it back, they do not meet that requirement if they are potentially responsible parties, so dismiss the case. Now, if that -- if you win in that respect, I'm asking if there is a need to reach the other two questions. Okay. I suspect there isn't, but am I right? Yes.
If you rule for us under Section 122 that they can't carry out their restoration remedy because they don't have EPA's permission, then that's sufficient to resolve the case. Fine.
Now they say they are not potentially responsible parties, but you say they are.
Why? Because in three -- because they are landowners with -- with hazardous waste on a Superfund site.
And three provisions textually equate all persons who are owners and operators under 107 because they own land on a Superfund site. But they say they are not potentially responsible.
Perhaps they were potentially responsible, but they are not potentially responsible because EPA and everybody else has told them they're not responsible. So no, and here is why: Potentially responsible parties has always been understood by this Court and everyone else as a status, not whether you could be liable. And their rule that says could you be liable at any given point in time is not only unheard of, it's unworkable, because you would never know whether a court would accept a defense, including -- Whether they were or they weren't potentially responsible parties, they are landowners, correct? And do I understand correctly, whether they're PRPs or not, if they're landowners, they can't take any -- they can't make any change without EPA approval? They can't take a statutorily defined term called remedial action that's defined in 101/24, and it defines what a remedial action is.
So they can do ordinary things to their property.
They can't do the major upheaval of 500,000 tons and -- Whether the PRP is responsible to someone else or to the EPA, whether they're continuous landowners or something else that exempts them, that -- that's my bottom line, which is the mere fact that they want to take some action on their land that's remedial, they would have to get EPA approval? Absolutely.
And PRP status, it doesn't -- Can you point me to the provision that says that, that says whether they're PRPs or not, as long as they're landowners, if they're going to take any remedial action on their property? So 122(e)(6) is the one that says PRPs have to have EPA's permission for any remedial action.
And then the 107, 122(a), 122(e)(1) and 105(h)(4) -- (h) -- excuse me, (h)(4)(A) is the one that defines or equates owners and operators under 107 with PRP status. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States is here because the narrow aspect of Respondents' suit that is before this Court, namely the request for a distinctive state law remedy under which a jury may authorize a plan to clean up toxic contamination at a Superfund site in a way that conflicts with and in many respects physically destroys the EPA plan selected under CERCLA, squarely conflicts with CERCLA and would jeopardize EPA's cleanups at this Superfund site and other Superfund sites across the nation. Now, to go to some of the questions that have -- have been raised already, this is a narrow -- our argument here is narrow.
The -- the statute does have savings clauses, and we don't dispute that Respondents can move forward with their claims for money damages under state law and nuisance and tort and other related theories that don't call into question the EPA remedy. And, likewise, as Justice Kagan pointed out, there are a number of mechanisms in the statute for states to adopt what are called ARARs, Applicable and/or Relevant and Appropriate Standards, that could be implemented as part of -- of the EPA cleanup plan. And I think that goes to a broader point, which is that CERCLA really lays out a two-step process.
At the first step, EPA, or whatever federal agency is conducting the plan, goes through a very reticulated process of getting public comment, meeting with -- meeting with landowners, meeting with the state, and selects a cleanup plan in -- in compliance with those procedural and the substantive requirement that they protect human health. Then, at the second stage, CERCLA says go and carry out the cleanup plan and CERCLA erects a number of protections -- Sorry, are you agreeing with Ms. Blatt that your plan is both the floor and the ceiling? So I think it -- not necessarily in every respect, but I think in the respect that matters in this case, it is.
And I -- No, no, no, let me -- let me go back.
Is it always the ceiling? I mean, an EPA -- An owner can come to you and say I want to do more, and you can decide yes or no, right? Yes, absolutely. So it's not always the ceiling. I mean -- yes.
And, in fact, the statute -- All right. -- as we discussed, as -- as Ms. Blatt discussed at length -- So are you reading their state -- are you reading this remedy as requiring the remediation that's awarded no matter what? With or without EPA approval? I -- I think the Montana Supreme Court decision implies that Respondents could move forward with their claim as it now exists even if they didn't have EPA approval. And we think that is -- How about if they did, if they could get your approval, if they could show that they could get your approval? I mean, if they could get our approval under 122(e)(6), then we wouldn't have a problem with -- with the suit, but I think that -- All right.
How about if they're not a PRP? Let's assume they're a contiguous -- there's a whole set of arguments in these briefs by some of them, putting aside whether they're a PRP because of -- of the statute of limitations, which, you know, is not very compelling to me, okay? But putting that aside, let's assume that by definition they are a PRP.
Or they're not a PRP; they're a continuous landowner.
They are not a PRP.
What about those people? So I think an important distinction is that if they were found to be a contiguous landowner, that would not take them out of the status of being a PRP.
That would imply that they're not liable, as -- as you pointed out -- All right.
So what you're saying is if you're a landowner, you might not be liable because some justices might have a problem with the concept that someone who didn't pollute and doesn't encourage the polluting would be financially liable. And that's an instinct that EPA shares as we quote in our brief.
EPA has had a policy since 1991 of not imposing liability on residential landowners on Superfund sites.
But -- So, Mr. Michel, if I could ask about the PRP status, because there are obvious consequences of labeling somebody a PRP in the way that you suggest, that these sites -- and they can be sites for decades and decade and -- and deprive people of doing some significant things that they want to do to their land. And the question, I guess, is why do you -- why do we think the statute requires those consequences as to a person whom has -- who has never been treated as a PRP by the government, who has never been involved in settlement negotiations, who, under reigning law, including the statute of limitations, has no liability exposure? I mean, it would seem a big deal to take a person like that and say you've lost some significant property rights.
Why? So I think two responses. First, I do want to make clear that 122(e)(6), the PRP provision that we're talking about here, only applies to remedial action.
And that has a defined statutory definition.
It's in 9601(a)(4). But I said some significant things. So -- so -- So, you know, look, that you can still, you know, make a garden. Absolutely, you can still make a garden.
Now, as to significant things, I think it does make perfect sense that you wouldn't want somebody who lives on a Superfund site doing things in the earth that will interfere with the EPA remedy.
Of course, you know, there's -- there is, on a Superfund site, a sort of butterfly flaps its wings problem where, if you dig up two feet of soil on your land, you can kick up arsenic into the air, or if you dig a trench on your land -- So I guess I -- I -- I completely take the point that that might have been a sensible policy decision for Congress to make, but, as I look at these provisions, the only -- the -- the -- where this PRP comes from is -- is -- is in a section that deals with settlement negotiations. And these people were not ever involved in settlement negotiations.
Nobody for a moment considered that they should be involved in settlement negotiations.
So to apply that section to these people seems, you know, a stretch. So I -- I don't think so, Justice Kagan.
I -- PRP is used in the statute a lot of different times, not just in the settlement.
You're right that (e)(6) is under the settlement provision, but if you look at (e)(1), it's -- it -- it equates owners on the site with PRPs.
And so the Court could leave for another day whether PRP is coterminous with covered persons under Section 107 and simply decide that owners on Superfund sites are PRPs. And, again, we think that makes perfect sense because, by definition, when you have a cleanup plan that takes into account an entire Superfund site, as this one does, and one landowner does something that affects the earth or affects the environment, it's going to spread across onto other parts of the Superfund site. And the water barriers that we've discussed in this case are a good example, where EPA has a considered plan to treat the water in a certain way, and Respondents want to dig -- I think it's an 8,000-foot trench that would change the gradient and would physically change the land in a way that could endanger the whole Superfund site off of their own property. So it is true that when you live on a Superfund site and you have large amounts of toxic chemicals, you are more restricted in the kind of land use that you -- But it seems a very indirect way for Congress to have gone about this, as Justice Kagan says, to, in essence, hinder a landowner from doing any significant action for decades. I mean, I think on -- it's not that strange to see that an owner of a Superfund site, somebody who lives on a contaminated property, is hindered from taking remedial action, which is a fairly significant action, without EPA approval.
Of course, EPA can grant approval, and EPA has in other cases granted approval for remedial actions on Superfund sites. So your two answers are, one, it's only significant action and, two, EPA could grant approval? Absolutely.
It's a -- so it's a limited incursion to the degree that it restricts property rights.
That's what comes with living on -- on a Superfund site, and that's what's necessary to protect -- Then -- then what is your answer to the question Ms. Blatt was asked? If we say the landowners are PRPs and they have to get EPA permission for any restoration that they want to do, if the Court said that, then I don't see that the further questions in this case need to be answered.
And I don't see any reason to get into preemption. I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg.
You could resolve the case by -- by saying that Respondents are PRPs who need EPA authorization -- authorization and don't have it and, therefore, their -- their claim fails. What do we do about the government's prior representations that permission might be granted for something like this? Well, I mean, the government stands ready to listen to EPA -- to any proposals from the landowners.
They have not formally presented us with any proposals, so we're working off of the best available information, which is the expert reports that they have introduced in the state litigation. So it's still at least possible that the government might approve something like this? I mean, based on what we know, we've made very clear, we're now in the Supreme Court litigating this case, that we would not approve what we understand their plan to be, but we're not saying never.
Of course, they could present something and we would listen to it. And I might -- might have missed it, but just when is the government's role here likely to finish in this particular site? So I think the government -- the ongoing remediation will continue through 2025, is the latest -- is the latest projection. It may be that, you know, there are continuing operations beyond that, but the active site remediation we expect to continue through about 2025. Is there -- is there a takings claim, do you think, that arises from the government's position that any remediation efforts for a period of, I guess, 45 years is prohibited by landowners? I mean, in the literal sense, there's no takings claim because they haven't raised one in this case.
I think more -- more broadly -- of course, one could raise a takings claim, but I think it would be a very weak claim given that, in fact, EPA's remedy has improved the value of the property and that you have to start from the premise that the property is -- is covered with arsenic. Well, it's -- it's -- it's improved the value of the property from its prior state but not -- not to a level that state law would allow. Well, I -- I do think that that's an important point, Justice Gorsuch, is that the EPA plan fully complies with the state environmental laws.
Those are the ARARs that I mentioned earlier.
This is a separate private plan that a jury would have to approve. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Palmore. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court lacks jurisdiction, but, if it finds it has jurisdiction, it should affirm. Briefly on jurisdiction: The decision below affirming denial of summary judgment on one damages theory and remanding for trial is non-final.
This Court has exercised review over Montana's supervisory writ decisions only where reversal by this Court would end the case entirely.
That critical condition is absent here. On the merits: This Court held and explained in CTS versus Waldburger -- If we -- I'm sorry, go ahead. -- that CERCLA does not establish a comprehensive remedial framework; instead, it leaves untouched state judgments about causes of action and the scope of liability for property damage.
Montana, like many other states, has made the judgment that one who puts toxic materials on another person's property is liable for trespass and nuisance and that a measure of recovery is the cost of removal. Nothing in CERCLA bars that core exercise of state authority to vindicate private property rights.
ARCO's invocation of Section 113(h) fails -- that's the challenge provision -- because it doesn't apply in federal court and even in federal court, it doesn't apply to state law claims. ARCO fares no better on Section 122(e)(6), the PRP provision, because the landowners here are not potentially responsible for anything because they face no possible liability.
And that provision certainly cannot be read to give EPA the vast power that it seeks, the ability to control forever the removal of a shovelful of dirt from a private landowner's backyard. There's no basis for preemption either.
CERCLA establishes a floor, not a ceiling, on environmental remediation, and in several provisions makes clear that Congress wanted to leave state law in place. Nor is there any impossibility.
The duty that ARCO breached was the duty not to pollute.
Nothing in federal law required it to do so.
Justice Sotomayor? I -- I still have a problem, which is it seems to me that if you go on a piece of -- if you own a piece of land and you know the EPA has been fixing it up, that whether you're responsible financially for the cleanup, that you shouldn't be able to interfere with the EPA's efforts, meaning you might have a takings claim, as Justice Gorsuch claims, you might have some other claims, but I don't know how you can go about instituting a plan without conflict preemption, instituting a plan that interferes with what the EPA is doing. Your Honor, first of all, and this is critical, there is no interference here.
The vast majority of my clients have had zero work done on their land. And if you put all their land together, the work has been done on only 5 percent, okay? So, on 95 percent of the land, literally nothing has been done.
So there's no undoing there. On groundwater, EPA made the decision to do nothing to clean the groundwater in Opportunity, so we're not undoing a remedy. We're doing something that EPA -- where EPA has done nothing.
And what's the 5 percent? They dug down 18 inches, they put in clean soil, and they planted grass. All we want to do -- Well, on the ground -- on the groundwater, I understand their position to be that if they did do something along the lines that you're proposing, it would have very significant adverse impacts.
So the fact that they haven't done anything, that's what they want you -- they don't want you to do anything. So you can't say having -- having done nothing represents that there's no -- there would be no adverse impact from what you plan to do. A couple answers on that, Chief Justice Roberts. First of all, they decided, and if you look at the actual regulatory materials, and that -- the EPA makes decisions in this area through records of decision, which are official documents, they say they didn't want to do the groundwater remedy, it was a different wall, it was a different one, because it was technically impracticable, which is a term of art under CERCLA for too expensive. In the regulatory materials, there is absolutely no finding that that wall, much less the one that we've proposed which is different, would call any environmental harm.
If you look to what the government cites here for that proposition, if you trace it through, it's citing its own amicus brief in the Montana Supreme Court. If you look at the Montana Supreme Court amicus brief, the government cites literally nothing. So you're talking about the particular specifics in your case.
But, as a general matter, for example, you can understand that the EPA looking at this might say, okay, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, and we're going to get to that as soon as we're done doing this other stuff. And yet someone else in your position would come in and say: Well, you're not doing anything here, and so we're going to go ahead and do this, when the EPA's answer might simply be that well, we haven't gotten to it yet, but we want to be the ones to decide what to do, rather than the particular landowners there, because we have a broader perspective affecting the whole site, rather than individual sites where the people may reasonably want something to be done but still may be inconsistent with EPA's plan. Well, here, Mr. Chief Justice, the issue isn't we'll get to that later.
They're done.
All the remedial work such as it was on our property has been over for several years.
They are completely done.
And that's another reason why there's no interference with anything they're doing. They're finished. I'm trying to move beyond your particular -- And I understand that. So one can imagine a different case involving a conflict preemption claim with respect to the EPA remedial orders.
That's not this case. ARCO's argument here, which -- which Ms. Blatt articulated, is that CERCLA itself establishes a floor and a ceiling, such that any state law remedy that goes beyond even one inch beyond what CERC -- what a remedial order required is preempted. They are not making a very different argument that in -- perhaps in a case like Your Honor is referring to could be made, which there could be an argument made that there is obstacle preemption with respect to an actual remedial order.
That case might look a lot like Geier, right? So if in a -- in a case EPA had evaluated various remedies and it had rejected a remedy because it said that remedy will cause environmental harm, so we choose not to adopt it -- No, the problem isn't -- I don't think the problem we're stating is anything to do with preemption or anything. It's just whether someone in your position should first have to go and get the EPA's permission. And you're talking about a shovel of dirt or something.
Suppose they did do something like that.
Isn't there a remedy? It's called the Administrative Procedures Act. And you say here they've made an administrative procedure, and it was arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion.
That way, as the Chief said, as others say, we channel all this through the EPA and the courts reviewing the EPA. And what we don't have is 10,000 juries or -- or 50 states or whatever it is imposing sometimes conflicting duties and leaving it up to hundreds of different judges to decide. Your Honor, a couple answers.
One is EPA doesn't need this 122(e)(6), which is what you're referring to, to prevent harm at a Superfund site or protect the integrity of its remedy.
The government made that point at page 17 of its invitation brief. It said we have plenty of tools.
We can get administrative orders.
We can get injunctions.
There's no problem here.
We can use those tools to protect the integrity of our -- of our remedy. 122(e)(6) applies only to potentially responsible parties.
What is a potentially responsible party? It is not defined in the statute.
So, under normal rules of statutory construction, this Court looks to what does that mean.
Is someone potentially responsible if they face no prospect of liability? No, they're not potentially responsible. I -- I -- It's been said they are covered parties.
And who is a covered party that is not a potentially responsible party? The -- the -- we are told that this Court has equated the term ""covered party"" with personally responsible party, that a covered party is a potentially responsible party.
And you say that's not right, they're not one and the same thing. So who is a covered party but would not be a potentially responsible party? There could be a number of ways.
And you're right, Justice Ginsburg, that this Court has, as shorthand, used the two, linked the two.
And the concepts are clearly linked.
All potentially responsible parties have to at one point been covered persons. But a covered person would include a residential landowner with certain exceptions. Justice Sotomayor, you asked about the contiguous landowner defense.
If you look at that, that is a carveout from the definition of owner, so someone who establishes the requirements that that carveout is not even an owner, so, under ARCO's view, where all owners under Section 107 are potentially responsible parties, those who satisfy that defense and the bona fide purchaser defense aren't even owners. But, more importantly, Congress could have said in 122(e)(6) all 107 covered parties have to get EPA permission in order to remove toxic waste for -- or arsenic from their land. It didn't say that.
It said potentially responsible parties.
It used a different term. Well, it did -- it did, Mr. Palmore, but, under your theory, how would you decide whether somebody is a potentially responsible party? It sounds like you would need a court adjudication to do that. And that seems unlikely that Congress meant for that to happen. Well, Your Honor, I don't think it would necessarily need a court adjudication.
And, in fact, the statute puts the onus on EPA.
This is Section 113(k)(2)(D) to notify, identify and notify all potentially responsible parties as early as it can before taking any removal action. So, here, we're talking about in the 1980s.
It's on them to identify potentially responsible parties and send them a letter.
And when there's settlement negotiations and you referred to this in Section 122, they have to identify all potentially responsible parties and include them.
They never -- So you're saying that even in the absence of the statute of limitations issue, these would not be potentially responsible parties because the government is subject to a kind of estoppel principle? I'm saying that if there is some concern about how will we know who a potentially responsible party is, the government has tools to at least put people on notice that it thinks they are potentially responsible parties. Now, of course, it might be wrong. But, in -- in this case, though, we never got any of those kinds of notices.
In the district court in this case, the government's brief said we take no position on whether these landowners are potentially responsible parties. They are -- they -- they own land that contains hazardous substances.
I thought that potentially responsible parties are people who own land, whether they have any fault or not, but their land does contain hazardous substances. It does, Justice Ginsburg.
And that makes them owners under Section 107, unless they are carved out from that definition by one of the defenses that we were talking about.
That makes them owners, but 107 does not use the phrase ""potentially responsible party."" And I think there's a -- there's a critical kind of elephants in a mouse hole aspect to this argument.
Section 122 -- and we reproduce all of it in the appendix to our brief at 50a through 80a -- is all about settlement. If you read it front to back, it's all about settlement. I understood -- And if that -- -- Ms. Blatt, as I -- because I made that point to her, and I thought that she said to me that there are other places in the statute which use the term ""potentially responsible parties,"" so that it's not all about settlement. There are a few others, most of them refer back to the settlement provision, but I think that explains the purpose of 122(e)(6) and also explains why it should be read according to its ordinary plain terms, which ""potentially responsible"" means -- ""potentially responsible"" means like someone who could be liable, which is that when there are settlement negotiations and EPA has notified all the PRPs of the settlement negotiations and included them -- something they've never done here, we've been excluded -- then they don't want these -- these parties who face possible liability and, therefore, are in settlement negotiations to go off and do their own remedial plan. But you think a party could be potentially responsible at one point but then at a later point cease to be potentially responsible? Absolutely, Your Honor, I do think that.
That's -- And what sense -- -- that's inherent in the -- -- would -- what sense would that make with respect to a rule limiting the ability of that party to engage in remediation? It's not consistent with the EPA plan. Because, Your Honor, first of all, that's the way statute of limitations work.
Right? Parties get repose when the statute has passed. And I think you have to understand the implications of the contrary position, which is -- you asked -- someone asked the question, when will this plan be over? It's already over on our land.
The plan overall is targeted to be completed in 2025. But it's never over because all of the arsenic and other contaminants will not be removed.
There is a five-year review process where more remedial action could be taken.
ARCO could be required to do it.
And that will go on literally forever. So the argument on the other side is that EPA has a permanent easement on my client's property requiring them to store ARCO's arsenic and lead forever unless we get EPA permission to remove it. Can I go back to Justice Kagan's question for a second? If EPA notified landowners early on that they were all PRPs, and you disagreed, how would that be resolved? Well, I think we -- we would then -- I think it kind of depends on how it comes up here.
This PRP issue is coming up in an odd posture in this case because I think it's critical to point out that what we're talking about here is, one, a measure of damages.
Right? These are trespass and nuisance claims. And under Montana law, we have -- the default is diminution of value.
But, if we can establish that we have personal reasons for wanting to stay on our property and -- and remove the arsenic, then we can get this other measure of damages, restoration damages.
And then it comes in, ARCO has argued that as like a defense to -- to that. I think her question went to it would be odd to think that the statute creates uncertainty about who is subject -- who is a PRP and who isn't, given who needs to get approval from EPA to do improvements on the land.
You would want certainty at the front end.
And if you can disagree and she said go to court, that seems unusual for this statutory structure.
Do you want to respond to that? Well, Your Honor, of course, EPA has the ability to provide some measure of certainty.
At least it can put people on notice that it believes they are PRPs. It's actually obligated to do that under the statute.
And it didn't do that here. Right.
But even if they do, there's disagreement, that would have to be resolved somehow with satellite collateral litigation, I think, or else we'd be back in the same spot decades later. Perhaps, Your Honor. But I think that the assumption behind those kinds of questions is that EPA critically needs 122(e)(6) in order to effectuate its goals -- Would -- would you -- -- on a CERCLA run -- -- think it would be a -- -- site, and that's not correct. -- would you think it would be an appropriate rule if basically it were up to EPA to designate potentially responsible parties or at least that there were a strong presumption that, if EPA designated somebody as a potentially responsible party, they were one? I -- I -- I don't -- they certainly don't have the -- the power to do it unquestionably, because it's -- it's a defined term under the statute. So they did send us such a letter as a litigation filing, as a letter to counsel, right before the cert petition in this case was filed. And so I don't think that -- that's not binding because they're wrong.
We're not potentially responsible parties.
And it also came decades after they were supposed to do that.
And they've never treated us as potentially responsible parties. But at least that would define a universe, if done properly, according to the statute -- Yeah, I -- -- of people -- -- actually -- you're quite right.
I was not clear enough in my question. I actually meant as -- that they would designate somebody as part of putting together the settlement negotiations that 136 is all about. Absolutely.
That would at least allow them to identify the universe and put people on notice that EPA -- The problem, knowing your land -- your clients are landowners of land that is polluted, and it's a Superfund site. Now they know that. Yes. You're a good lawyer. I wouldn't think there was actually a problem of their being ignorant.
Maybe there is.
I don't know what it is.
I haven't seen it. So does it boil down to -- and you said this, but I don't think you're right -- that -- that, on the one hand, you said EPA gets some kind of permanent easement on their property to tell them what to do.
But isn't that an overstatement? What EPA can do is they can say we don't want you physically to change this land. And if you think that they are unreasonable, you go to court.
That's their side of it. And you say they're unreasonable. Okay? That's simple.
And most people can do that.
And if you win, then it's really about the same thing.
You can go and say, look, we under our Montana statute believe that we should not just get money, but we should get money that is earmarked and must be used to make physical changes in the property.
That's the problem. And if you can do that, it may be easier to get.
But the problem is that there could be many states that have that, and you can't run it in a central way. Have I stated correctly what the issue is? Perhaps, Your Honor. First of all, a couple answers.
One is Congress wanted to allow state law to -- to proceed -- They did for damages. There is no doubt. And for what -- But is there -- -- and -- -- any indication they wanted physical changes to be made by 40 different entities? Yes, Your Honor.
If you look at Section 114(b), which is a no double recovery provision, Congress contemplated that there would be state law recovery for removal, and the only limit it put on it was that there be no double recovery. Congress knew that there could be state law -- state law recovery for removal and it allowed it to continue. And also I think that the -- the -- the -- But what, Mr. Palmore, of the argument that what the state court might order conflicts with what EEOC -- that what the EPA, for -- one example was given here.
You want more arsenic removed.
EPA said that that would involve danger.
There would be additional hazards. The -- the problem with not having EPA as the overall supervisor means that there -- that there can be clashes between what state law says is okay and what EPA says should be the proper treatment.
So -- Justice Ginsburg, of course, if EPA thinks that a remedy is going to cause harm, as it said in its invitation, we believe it has ample tools to stop it. Second of all, there is simply in this case -- that might be an issue in another case. In this case, there is no such finding in any of the regulatory documents of -- of environmental harm. They just said we're going to go this far and no further.
They didn't reject any -- they didn't reject our permeable wall to clean the groundwater.
They didn't say we can't do 24 inches, much less did they say that any of those things would cause environmental harm. So in a -- in -- one can imagine -- Maybe it was a moot question if it's your obligation to ask them, meaning, if you are a PRP and that's what we conclude, it would be your obligation to ask them for permission. So, if Ms. Blatt is right that the award here, assuming you were to get one, were conditioned on you being a PRP and any action you took had to be approved by the EPA, what damage does this do to you? That would be a question -- You -- you would have administrative remedies to challenge their denial of any activity you wanted to take.
That would be litigated by a court.
But at least there would be clarity.
Landowners on super site funds, before you interfere with the EPA, get their approval or before you attempt to or before you attempt to do anything, get their approval.
What's wrong with such a ruling? Well, Your Honor, of course, our position is we're not required to get approval because we're not PRPs.
If we lose on that and if you conclude we -- we also are not contiguous landowners, which carves us out -- I don't have to decide that. -- of the definition of owner -- That -- the Court -- Well, their argument is all owners are PRPs. Whether -- If we're not owners -- -- whether -- -- we're not a PRP. -- just assume -- If you -- -- that we rule that you're -- -- assume away all of that, then it's really a state law question. This is a state law question. No, it's not a state law question. It -- it -- We would hold that it would -- it would conflict with federal law, with federal rules, if you go ahead with that -- with remediation without EPA approval.
You are a PRP.
And conflict preemption stops you from taking any actions that are not approved by the EPA, period, end of case. The reason that would be a remand question, Justice Sotomayor, is because we haven't asked the EPA for that permission because we've -- we don't believe we are PRPs. And, in fact, EPA itself took no position on whether we are PRPs in this very case. So we might be able to get in the district court in Montana -- I thought their whole brief said you were -- In the district court in Montana, the U.S. Government said we take no position on whether landowners here are PRPs. Their position has changed dramatically over time. What I'm saying is we never had any reason to seek their permission.
If you were to hold that we need their permission, then we -- A, we might get it, they've said before that there are aspects of our plan they could approve; and, B, to the extent that there's uncertainty about that, that is a state law question because, again, all we're talking about here is whether -- No, it's not a state law question. It's embedded -- it's a federal question -- We have said there's a conflict, it's a federal question -- It's a federal question embedded in a state law question because the state law question is: Do we intend to use this money to clean up our land? And that prevents windfalls.
That's the Montana Supreme Court's decision in Sunburst. What they're saying is, well, you may not get EPA approval to clean your land, so you wouldn't actually be able to do it.
How that uncertainty, that possibility of need for EPA approval would be factored into the damages calculation is a state law question. Can -- If I could return to Justice Breyer's question. Well, okay, before you do that, I just was hoping you might return to Justice Ginsburg's question.
And let -- let's suppose for the purposes of this hypothetical that you're -- you're not a PRP but that EPA thinks that some aspects of your plan would interfere with its interests. You said that the EPA has plenty of tools available to it in that scenario to address any conflicts.
Can you be specific about what EPA could do to take care of its interests in that scenario? Yes, Your Honor.
And I -- I -- you don't have to take my -- Because 122 won't work, right? You don't have to take my word for it.
You can look at page 17 of the government's invitation brief in this case, where it said you don't need to take cert on this PRP issue because we have plenty of tools in order to safeguard the integrity of our remedial plan.
Those are under Section 106.
It can seek administrative orders.
It can seek injunctions.
There are plenty of tools it can -- Can it do that even with respect to somebody who's not a PRP? Absolutely.
If -- if someone is going to do something that's going to release toxic substances into the -- onto their neighbors' property or into a creek or something, then they have plenty of tools to address that.
They don't need this -- this ongoing supervision. And that ties into a part of Justice Breyer's question, which I didn't ask yet.
I think -- answer yet, which is you were asking about well, couldn't they get approval and why is this -- why might this be a taking.
It depends on what the default rule is, right? Where does the property right lie? Does it lie with -- lie with EPA? Or does it lie with the landowners? Under Montana law, we have a right, a wrongdoer has put arsenic on our land, and we have a state law right to get a judgment sufficient to remove it. It's not -- that's not applying the CERCLA health standard.
That's applying bread-and-butter Montana property law. Am I right that your answer to Justice Gorsuch's question really just turns on who has the burden? Under your theory, EPA has the burden to initiate proceedings; under the other side's argument, the landowner has the burden to go to EPA first? Is that an accurate way of looking at it? That is, Your Honor.
So they -- the presumption is we are private property owners, that we have control of our own property, and we can remove arsenic on our own property if we want to.
Nothing in their 122(e)(6) argument -- The question is whether CERCLA displaces that presumption. Whether CERCLA displaces that forever -- Right. Right? A thousand years from now, under their view, we would -- if we wanted to remove a shovelful -- But either -- -- of dirt -- -- way -- sorry to interrupt.
Either way, EPA would have the say. It's just whether EPA initiates or you go to EPA.
I think you just said that. Yeah, but I think the default rule is critical, right? I mean, we have the bundle of property rights -- Yeah. -- and if we, you know, commit an environmental offense, then EPA as a regulator can use its power -- What would the -- -- to go after us. -- government have to show? What's the -- what would -- what would the test be? What would the legal standard be? If -- if they went after us, it would be a violation of -- of CERCLA. These are the -- this is what -- and the government itself took the position that those tools are fully adequate here to protect the integrity of the remedy. These things are likely to be pretty complicated.
And if we -- one way, it's central, everyone goes to EPA, and there's a central review in court. The other way, you want EPA to go to any place where a landowner has a law in -- in his favor that lets him do some things, and EPA is going to have to prove that this particular thing in each of these cases is a CERCLA violation, which is already a standard that's -- it might not, it might just be an interference with their plan.
It might just be raising the cost of their plan.
It might be who knows.
I'm not an expert in this. But that's -- that's the question: How did Congress want this to work? Right.
And one can imagine Congress writing a statute to give EPA complete control, but it didn't -- it didn't do that. And it might have used the words potentially responsible person has to go to EPA and, by that, meant that those people who live or own property on a toxic waste center.
That's what they argue. Right, Your Honor, their position is that every single private property landowner -- Yeah. -- in this vast 300-square-mile Superfund site has to get their permission to remove even a shovelful of dirt from their own backyard. No, I don't know that they -- Well, but that's the reason, though -- That is page 34 of the Blue Brief.
ARCO says remedial action covers virtually any physical action with respect to hazardous waste at the site, including storage, excavation.
It has a list there.
It's virtually anything. They're saying that our -- my clients in Opportunity, Montana, have to get permission from EPA in Washington if they want to dig out part of their backyard to put in a sandbox for their grandchildren and -- And are you saying also it's an -- Well, you can say dig out -- you can say dig out part of their backyard.
EPA would say if you want to disturb arsenic-infected land, dirt in a way that would not only harm your neighbors but could harm people many -- many miles away.
I mean, yes, you want to just do things -- And if -- -- on your land, but you can't overlook the fact that that is going to have harmful effects on everybody else around you. And if you assume that harm that's assumed, embedded, in your question, they have the tools to go after that.
What I'm talking about is when there's no showing of harm.
Their argument is whether there's harm or not, we have to get their permission. And if I can -- I guess the -- Just -- -- question, though, is -- and, you know, you might say, look, this is a policy matter and Congress decided it.
But I guess the question is it -- it's hard for EPA to go around and try to figure out who's creating sandboxes.
And so why should the onus be on EPA to figure out who's creating sandboxes? Well, EPA is, of course, all over this site, and it can enforce the law here.
The question is whether we are -- should be similarly situated to just you and me and any American who, if we violate the law, the regulator, the law enforcement, can come after us, or whether we have this kind of superintending presence of agency authority over us and our private property for the rest of our lives.
And that's not what -- that's not the scheme that Congress created.
It went out of its way to allow state law over these traditionally state law subjects to continue. But your -- your -- your parade of horribles can still come true with EPA being aggressive in getting to all those places.
So really the question that -- If -- if they want to come out -- you're right. -- the question Justice Breyer asked is does it make sense to have you go to EPA first so that they can maintain control? ""Comprehensive"" is the word in the statute after all. Your Honor, there's no evidence that Congress intended this obscure corner of Section 122 about settlements to give EPA that kind of vast control forever over private property. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Sotomayor, I answered one of your questions incorrectly on a cite, and I -- I need to correct it.
Section 107(q)(1)(A) 3 through 5 is the contiguous landowner provision that says if you live on a Superfund site, no matter what, you have to make sure you comply and not interfere with EPA. So there's provisions throughout CERCLA that say no matter what your defenses may be, you always are on the hook to not do anything to interfere with EPA's remedy.
And I just gave you different cites. So, on PRPs, in terms of this is a status and not a financial liability, EPA, they're always liable under 106 for abatement. And they're always liable in a suit by Atlantic Richfield when the cleanup ends under Section 113(g)(2)(A).
We might not get much money, but they're -- they're definitely on the hook. But the real question is one of status.
And it's -- Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, you were wrong on this as being a question of who has to sue and a burden.
EPA would have no way of knowing what -- they only know in this case and wrote them a letter because there's a lawsuit and a Supreme Court case in the state of Montana, but there are hundreds of thousands of people who live on -- live on Superfund sites with uranium and God knows what else, and how is EPA exactly supposed to know when someone is removing uranium? It has a half-life of 4.7 billion years. Arsenic has no half-life.
It always is there.
It cannot be destroyed.
It doesn't evaporate.
So, yeah, they have some restrictions before they move hazardous waste. The other thing is in terms of who you'd have to sue, I would freak out if I got a -- a -- a letter.
Their view is you have to sue these poor innocent landowners and say you're liable under CERCLA.
Just so you know, that's the only way we can keep control of the site. That's the only way we're going to know and then, you know, now they're on notice because, otherwise, you would have this metaphysical thing of who knows who's liable? In terms of the taking issue, and I think that Justice -- I mean, you guys already answered this, but this is really a question of do you have to go to EPA.
If EPA denies permission and they want to bring a takings claim, go sue EPA. There's also a citizen suit provision that in 2025, they can bring a lawsuit and say: EPA, your remedy was terrible, we don't like it, it violated CERCLA, come up with a new one. That -- that's what the citizen suit provision is before -- for. On the mouse hole point, I don't think it's a mouse hole.
So it has mouses or elephants, I guess, all the way in the statute. There are provision after provision in the contiguous landowner, in the demicrominimus -- or whatever that word is -- in the bona fide landowner that says at all times you have to make sure you don't interfere with EPA's remedy. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-882, Babb versus Wilkie. Mr. Martinez. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 633a states that all federal personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.
Both parties agree that that language tracks the text and meaning of Title VII's identical federal sector provision covering race, sex, and religion. Together the two provisions bar discrimination not only in the ultimate outcome of a personnel decision but also in the process of making that decision.
That's true regardless of whether the prohibited characteristic at issue is a but-for cause of the final decision. That's the rule that the MSPB and the EEOC have applied in countless cases for many years, but more importantly it flows directly from the statutory text. The phrase ""free from any discrimination"" governs how the decision shall be made.
In other words, the process for making that decision.
If that process uses age or race as a negative factor, it's not made free from any discrimination. Congress chose those words carefully rejecting the private sector language later addressed in Gross and Nassar.
It did so in the unique federal sector context to create a remedy for violating constitutional equal protection rights.
This Court has said that when a plaintiff is subjected to discrimination in the process of being considered for a government benefit, he necessarily suffers a redressable equal protection injury even if he can't prove he otherwise would have received a benefit. That same injury rule governs 633a and Title VII.
That rule is fully consistent with common law principles and this Court's but-for causation analysis in other cases. The government, in this case, apparently believes it's perfectly lawful for federal agencies to apply younger-is-better or whiter-is-better hiring policies to individuals who can't prove that they would have been hired but for those policies.
That's anti-textual and it's wrong. Decisions applying such blatantly discriminatory policies are obviously not made free from any discrimination.
The government's theory contradicts the plain statutory language. But you say that the but-for causation is not required for liability, but then at the relief stage, as I understand your briefs, you say that but-for causation is required for reinstatement or back pay.
And where is that in the statutory text? So we would say that -- that at the -- at the remedial stage, ordinary remedial principles would apply, and those principles would require that the victim, the -- the plaintiff, be made whole for the violation. And under those ordinary principles that I think are undisputed on both sides, if the evidence shows that the -- the person, the plaintiff, couldn't -- wouldn't have gotten hired anyway, they shouldn't get remedies that are specifically and logically tied to that -- that thing that they -- they weren't -- wouldn't have been entitled to the in first place. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't get the kinds of prospective relief that are available in a wide array of other cases.
For example -- And why -- why would we go all the way up the hill and then come all the way back down at the relief stage and just say, oh, well, you really do need but-for causation because, as you rightly say, if you haven't suffered a -- an action because of age, you're not entitled to reinstatement -- You -- Your Honor, with respect, you wouldn't be coming all the way down the hill because there would be a wide range of other types of remedies that would be available other than reinstatement and back pay.
For example, you might be entitled to -- to an injunction telling the government to stop discriminating. This case -- What would you -- This -- this case, because there is -- at least one of her allegations is that she was passed over and younger people were selected for the coagulation unit.
Now, suppose that's true, younger women were selected, but they were better qualified; they had experience and training that she lacked. So what would be the remedy? You -- you would say there is a violation because age was taken into account.
What -- what relief -- you said it wouldn't be going all the way back down the hill in answer to -- Sure. -- Justice Kavanaugh.
What would the relief be? So, first of all, assuming that the government could show that -- that she wouldn't have gotten the job -- we'll just take that as a given I think implicit in the question -- then she wouldn't be entitled to reinstatement or back pay, but she would be entitled to remedies like EEO training so that this kind of discrimination wouldn't happen to her next time she applies for a promotion or next time she seeks an opportunity.
That kind of training is -- is a classic remedial relief that's available in these types of cases.
In some -- Do -- who would get the training? The training we be the -- the supervisors and perhaps the -- the -- you know, the -- the others within the Bay Pines Medical Center who had contributed to the discriminatory treatment in the first place.
I think if the -- if a court -- you know, we're here at summary judgment, but if the court -- if the proof at trial showed that there was some sort of more generalized policy of discriminating against people because they were older, the court could also issue some prospective relief that would say that those policies are unlawful. In a lot of these cases, what a court does is -- is requires the entity to post a notice saying here's the finding of discrimination against us, so that people can read that notice, understand what went wrong last time, and not do it again in the future. Would -- Would that remedy -- -- that require -- Oh, I'm sorry. So no particular relief directly benefiting her? No, Your Honor. That's -- Or atmospheric relief, institutional relief, but she herself gets nothing tangible? I think those things would be very tangible for her, Your Honor, because she's still an employee there, she's still operating day to day in that environment, and she still wants to take advantage of future opportunities for training.
And so if -- if the -- if she gets these kinds of corrective remedies, it's going to make it better for her and easier for her next time when she wants to apply for the opportunity, to be treated fairly without regard to age. And this is the kind of forward-looking relief that this Court has often recognized is appropriate, even without but-for causation, for example, in the constitutional cases that we've talked about.
So in cases -- Would -- would the remedy be any different than might be obtained under the civil service laws? Well, under the civil service laws, Your Honor, the -- the way the civil service laws work is Section 2302 of the CSRA says that the way you bring a discrimination claim is to sue under this statute that we're currently talking about. There are -- there are other remedies available though, right? I -- I -- I guess I'd have to focus specifically -- I'm not sure specifically what you'd be asking for, but the way I read the civil service laws is that -- that these types of claims need to be brought under this particular statute. Mr. Martinez -- Now -- -- we're assuming the worst for your client, that the government is right that she would not have been hired but-for.
But as I understand the equal protection claim, it's that the process would be free from discrimination. Right. So that even if she can't prove she would have gotten the job, she still has an opportunity to prove, qua a remedy, that age was considered and considered inappropriately. Correct. So, for example -- give me an example of a defense to one of the government's allegations, because there were four allegations, four or five, of different employment scenarios that she didn't qualify for. Right. But give me an example in those four or five of a process that could have -- that she might have won on, that she might have prevailed in showing that that process was corrupted because of her age. Sure.
So for -- one example is she sought certain training opportunities.
And I think if -- if in the course of -- if the Court concluded after looking at all the evidence that the reason that she was denied those training opportunities was partly because they thought there were other candidates who were good, but partly because they had -- they had a conversation around a table and said, you know, Ms. Babb, she's -- she's -- she's really kind of old, we don't really like her, she keeps filing these EEO claims, she keeps asserting her rights in this way.
Let's not give her the training opportunities in part for that reason. It may be that the government, hypothetically, could come back and prove that there were other more qualified candidates, but that process has been infected by the consideration of those very significant factors of -- of pure age discrimination. I think if we look at -- Usually -- usually when we have -- conclude that there's a tainted process, we make the decisionmaker go back and do it over without the taint, don't we? I think you do in a circumstances, Your Honor, and in a circumstance which that was possible, that might well be the -- an available remedy as well. I think we -- we are several years past the -- you know, the particular promotion decision and the particular role.
I don't know if those roles even currently exist in the same way they did several years ago.
But I think that's yet another example of the kind of equitable remedy that could be awarded if the process was determined to be tainted. Mr. Martinez, you started by saying that this was a process statute.
And I guess I want to press you on why you think that is. If I understood your brief, it was about the word ""made,"" but, I mean, that's a possible interpretation of this language, but another interpretation is that when you say that a personnel action should be made free from any discrimination, you're talking about the actual action, the discharge, the failure to promote, whatever, and saying that that action -- at the moment in time when it occurs, that action has to be free from discrimination rather than saying that the entire process leading up to it, including all the irrelevant things that happened that played no role in the action, has to be free from discrimination. So why do you read this as a process statute? I -- I think that's a helpful way.
Maybe I could just walk you through my interpretation of the statute.
And then we have it reproduced here at page 5 of the blue brief. And so 633a(a), I think they're sort of three big chunks to the statute that are relevant here.
First is the subject of the -- of the sentence, ""all personnel actions."" Then there's the verb, ""shall be made."" And then finally there's an adverbial phrase, ""free from any discrimination based on age."" And we think the real work here is being done by the combination of the adverbial phrase, ""free from any discrimination"" that modifies the verb ""shall be made."" It's not made on its own, it's the combination of those things. And we think that in context, that adverbial phrase answers the question of how the decision shall be made.
It's not saying what's the decision.
It's not saying when does the decision have to happen.
It's talking about how that decision shall be made.
That's a -- that's process language. I think the second thing is, once you look within the adverbial phrase, within the ""free from any discrimination based on any age"" phrase, you should ask yourself, okay, well, what does this process have to be free from? The next part of the statute is ""any discrimination."" And the word ""discrimination"" has been interpreted under its plain meaning and this -- and in this Court's decision in Jackson just to mean unequal differential or less favorable treatment. And we think that that is -- we accept that, I think the Solicitor General has conceded that that's the understanding of discrimination. So I think what the Solicitor General would say is, sure, it's unequal treatment but a person is only subject to unequal treatment if he or she doesn't get the outcome that he would otherwise have gotten. Well -- And if everything ends up the same, then there's been no unequal treatment. Well, I think -- I think, Your Honor, that's why the first part, the ""free from"" language and the fact that it's an adverbial phrase modifying the verb, and that that language is talking -- signals that we're talking about process. Once you know that we've got this -- we've got this modifier that's a process modifier, that's talking about the process, I think that then sheds light on what we mean by discrimination. Well, what -- what about the subject, ""actions""? Right. And that's a term that's used in Nassar, a term that used in Gross, the word ""action,"" and the action is usually referred to as an adverse employment action, namely as Justice Kagan says, the decision.
And your brief uses the word ""process"" over and over, and the CS -- civil service laws that Justice Gorsuch referenced do say that the process has to be free of any -- you have to be treated fair and equitably throughout the -- the process but this doesn't say that.
It says ""action."" So how do we deal with the word ""action""? Well, I think you need to read it again in -- in the context of the whole sentence.
And it -- and it doesn't say actions shall be -- can't be based on age.
It says, ""actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age."" And so that -- that phrase, we agree with the Solicitor General.
I think they say this -- I think they say this on -- in their -- in their own brief.
They -- they -- they say that the -- the -- the work that's done by the phrase ""personnel action"" is simply to explain the range of employment-related actions that's -- that's covered by the statute generally.
It doesn't bear on the but-for causation question. I don't know -- I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Just to -- to answer the question about action, I think the key point here is, if you look at -- if you look at this page 5 of our blue brief, it -- what strikes me is the phrase that the Solicitor General relies on, ""based on age,"" that's what they're getting -- where they're getting their but-for causation textual argument.
It's all the way down at the bottom of the -- at the end of that paragraph. And if you look at it, it modifies the word ""discrimination,"" which is immediately to the left.
But what the Solicitor General is asking you to do is take that based on age -- age phrase, walk up 17 lines of text, turn left and have it modify ""personnel actions."" That's just not how the -- the statute reads. And I think what -- what this Court has always done and -- and needs to do is look very carefully at the wording of the statute. This is the same point that Judges Tatel and Sentelle made in the DC Circuit that this statute -- Judge Henderson disagreed. Judge -- you know, Judge Henderson concurred, Your Honor, so she agreed with the remand.
She -- she expressed some doubts about maybe the -- the -- the clarity or the -- the force of the particular arguments that Judges Tatel and Sentelle made. But the bottom line here is I think grammatically there's no question that ""based on age"" modifies ""discrimination."" But what happens if age plays no role whatsoever in the actual decision but at some prior point in the process, age was considered.
I don't know that anything -- I don't think your argument depends on whether we look just at the final decision or we look at the whole process.
But what would happen in that situation? I think it would -- it would depend.
So maybe I'd have to understand the hypothetical a little bit more. I think if -- if -- if someone could look at the entire -- at the -- the decisionmaking process and say that age was not a factor at all, then I think we would not -- a -- a -- a -- a plaintiff would not prevail.
But if age played a significant role at the beginning of the process in some way, then I think it -- it would not be made free from discrimination under the plain language of the statute. Well, but if -- if the statute prohibits any discrimination, I don't know where you get your qualification that it has to be a significant factor.
It doesn't to have affect the final action.
So what type of discrimination, any type -- let's say in the course of the, you know, weeks' long process, you know, one comment about age, you know, the hiring person is younger, says, you know, ""OK Boomer,"" you know -- (Laughter.) -- once to the -- to the applicant.
Now, you're only concerned about process.
You're not concerned about but-for causation.
It doesn't have to have played a role in the actual decision.
So is that actionable? I -- I think we would say that it does have to play a role in the decisionmaking process that -- that leads to the decision.
And I think in that particular case, if -- if it really had no role, if it was just sort of, you know, a -- a stray comment in the air, I think that on the facts of that, I think a -- a court could conclude -- So how do you -- how do you tell what's a significant factor in the decision? We're not saying it has to be a -- No. We're not using the term -- Some factor. -- ""significant."" We're saying that -- ultimately, we're saying what the statute says, which is that the -- that it needs to be made free from discrimination. We think that applies to the process as a whole. Well, you say free from any discrimination -- Even better. -- it doesn't have to result in the final decision.
I'm just trying to see how many stray comments do you need and who has to make them before you decide that, although it says ""any,"" we don't really mean any.
We mean some discrimination that has a particular effect, even if it's not but-for. I'm just wondering if -- Yeah. -- your position is going to become a -- a -- a -- really just a regulation of speech in the workplace. Oh, of course not, Your Honor. Well, of course -- well, then explain how not. Well, if -- if -- if the speech in the workplace is, you know, using ethnic slurs or -- or, you know, calling people ""Boomer"" or saying unflattering things about them in age when considering them for a position, then, yes, of course. So calling somebody a ""Boomer"" and considering them for a position would be actionable? I think if -- if -- if -- if the decisionmakers are sitting around the table and they say, we've got Candidate A who's 35 and we've got Candidate B who's 55 and is a boomer and is probably tired and -- and, you know, doesn't know -- have a lot of computer skills, I think that absolutely would be actionable. Well, what if he just calls him a ""Boomer."" I mean that -- I'm just trying to -- I think that -- I -- I -- it -- it seems to me like that would be a classic question for the fact finder.
But if the fact finder were to conclude that that statement reflected, was one of the factors going into this decision, I think it absolutely would be covered. But the key -- I think it absolutely would be covered. Is -- is -- when you answered that question, I had thought you would say, and you didn't, and -- and so this is why I have a question.
There is another statute, Title VII, and what it says is when the discrimination is a motivating factor, but even though other factors also motivated that practice. Right. Now -- now, I thought you were going to pick up the same standard. We -- we think that our standard is essentially the same standard.
We just -- Right. We just haven't -- So we could say in the opinion what this means, to be free, is the same thing that Congress said when it amended Title VII, that it isn't enough to show -- if you just show -- you don't have to show, plaintiff, that it is but-for, but you do have to show it was a motivating factor even though there may have been other ""motivating factors."" Right. And, therefore, there is no more administrative problem in this than there is anyway under Title VII.
Now, that's what I'd thought you'd -- but you didn't say that.
So now I don't -- Let me -- let me just -- You disagree with me because you -- No, no, no. -- think it -- -- let me explain.
The -- Yeah, go ahead. The reason we had -- we didn't do that is because, I think as everyone would agree, by its terms, that provision does not directly apply to this statute. No, I know it doesn't. I'm just explaining -- Yeah. -- why I didn't say it. But I think the substance of the point is exactly right.
I think that -- that -- that this would not create administrability problems. You would actually be clarifying the law and creating a -- Well, wait a second -- Well, another reason -- another reason you may not have said it is because it comes with another flip side, right? It was a motivating factor, but then the defendant gets to show it wasn't -- the decision would have been made without regard to it. Yeah, but, Your Honor, that would -- that happens at the remedial stage, at the relief stage.
And that's exactly our point, is that, at the relief stage, the defendant does get to show -- But in those statutes, in that statute, it happens at the liability stage, and I read your briefs -- No -- no, Your Honor -- And I -- I read your briefs -- yeah, in the statute, I understand -- I read your briefs to reject the motivating factor or not adopt the motivating factor standard. No.
Let -- let me be clear because this is -- this is an important point. The Price Waterhouse-type standard that Justice Breyer brought up. I think Justice Breyer was talking about what Congress did to fix the problem of Price Waterhouse.
So Price Waterhouse happens.
Congress decides that the Price Waterhouse test is insufficiently protective of victims.
So Congress makes very clear in the statute that there is a violation of the statute, there is liability with motivating factor, but if the employer can show that -- that it wasn't a but-for cause, that shrinks the number of remedies that are available to you. And that's essentially -- we're not saying that -- we're not trying to, like, apply different statutory language here, but we're saying that our rule, the statutory language that we have, essentially has that same test -- But you're not asking -- -- test -- Sorry to interrupt. Right. You're not asking for ""motivating factor;"" you're saying ""any factor."" Right, but I think the way that -- Is that correct? We -- we -- we -- we don't think it makes a difference, frankly, Your Honor.
We -- And so, yes, you're asking for any factor? We think ""any factor"" and ""motivating factor"" essentially mean the same thing because they play -- the -- the factor plays into the decision.
And so in that sense, it's motivating. Counsel, I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to another argument that concerned me. Sure. The Solicitor General suggests that if we were to adopt your view, we'd have to do the same thing with respect to private discrimination under, what is it, the 623 -- Right. -- which, of course, we can't do because of Gross, and point specifically to the language saying, you know, you can't discriminate in hiring or otherwise, right, discriminate -- Right. -- with respect to terms and conditions of -- of -- of employment. And if we were to adopt your broad reading here of ""discriminate,"" why wouldn't we do the same thing there? So I think Gross is totally different, and just a couple points on this because it's very important.
Number one, Congress looked at that exact language when it was legislating the statute that's at issue in this case.
Congress rejected applying the private sector language from the ADEA to ADEA federal sector claims.
We know that from the drafting history.
We know that from -- I -- I understand that -- So -- so -- -- but that's not responsive.
So -- Right.
So, instead, it chose different language which is fundamentally different from the language in Gross.
I'm going to get to the discriminate point. I wish you would. Okay.
I'll -- I'll -- I'll go to the discriminate point.
If you look at the language in Gross, and we've reproduced it in the addendum to our reply brief, what it has is it talks about four different specific types of adverse actions: Failing to hire, refusing to -- failing to hire, refusing to hire, discharging any individual; and then, the fourth one, otherwise discriminate with respect to terms -- Conditions. -- compensation, conditions. Yeah.
Yeah. The first three of those things are all outcome-based.
The first three items in the list.
The fourth item in the list is an ""otherwise"" clause, an ""otherwise"" sort of catch-all clause. Why wouldn't that be process too, is the Solicitor General's question? Well -- well, the first three things are all -- the first three in that list are all outcome-based.
And so what this Court has said when looking at very similar ""otherwise"" catch-all clauses, it's applied the ejusdem generis canon and said that when you have things in a list like that, the last item with the ""otherwise"" -- So -- so the word ""discriminate"" here means something different than the word ""discriminate"" there. I think the word ""discriminate"" here needs to be read in the context of the broader phrase.
The other contextual difference is that our statute, unlike the statute in Gross, has the most important textual indicator that comes -- makes this case come out our way, which is the ""shall be made free from"" language. No, I understand that.
But the ""otherwise discriminate,"" what -- you've got the ejusdem generis canon.
Excellent canon, good canon.
The other -- the other kind of general rule is when Congress makes a distinction, we should attend to the -- in language, we should attend to it.
And -- and -- We couldn't agree -- we couldn't agree more. And I understand -- I know where you're going with that, and that's good, that's a good point -- (Laughter.) -- but ""or otherwise discriminate"" -- Yeah. -- is -- is very -- I mean, that -- that seems to be a catch-all. That seems to be anything. I think I would resist that one because of ejusdem generis.
The second point, textually -- You think you would have resisted that before Gross? I -- you know, Your Honor, we're not here to relitigate Gross. No. I -- I think this -- Gross was a very closely decided decision.
You know, it was -- it was a very closely divided Court on Gross.
We're not here to -- we're -- we're here to make the point that what Gross said was that you need to look at the statutory language with careful attention -- careful and critical examination.
And this is -- this is a quote from Gross, you can't apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without really looking carefully -- But the -- -- and here the ""otherwise discriminate"" clause is limited by ""with respect to terms, conditions,"" et cetera. That's not -- So it's very narrow. -- limiting; that's broadening language.
That's -- that's supposed to be a catch-all phrase at the end that will cover anything.
""Otherwise discriminate against anything dealing with compensation terms or conditions."" The word ""conditions,"" in particular, in the lower courts has been interpreted very broadly to cover all sorts of -- Right. -- aspects, whereas here you just have ""actions,"" so if you're comparing the two statutes, to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's point, I would have thought a broader scope, if anything, was in that language -- I -- -- in terms of -- I think the word ""discrimination"" sometimes can take on different meanings depending on the context.
The most important textual -- the textual clue is the absence of the key phrase ""shall be made free from discrimination."" The most important historical clue is that, unlike the statute in Gross, this statute arises in a context in which Congress wanted to address the constitutional rule, wanted to plug the gap in remedies, and -- and make sure that -- that victims of unconstitutional discrimination had a viable remedy. Thank you, counsel. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The federal sector ADEA adopts the same causation standard applicable to state and local governments and private companies, but-for causation. Three basic points make this clear. First, Section 633 -- 633a prohibits the Federal Government from making a personnel action based on age.
But you don't make a personnel action based on age if you make the same decision that you would have made for a similarly situated younger person since any consideration of age has not affected the decision that you have made.
At the very least, as in Gross and Nassar, nothing in 633a clearly overrides the common law default rule of but-for causation. Second, Congress easily could have overridden the common law default rule if it wanted to.
It could have applied the motivating factor standard to the ADEA, or it could have gone further and prohibited any consideration of age no matter how fleeting.
But it didn't do that.
Instead, it adopted language that this Court has interpreted as incorporating the common law default rule. Finally, our rule makes perfect sense. There's no reason why Congress would have created a lower causation standard for the Federal Government than for state and local governments.
After all, there's no evidence that Congress was more concerned about discrimination by the Federal Government. That's why Senator Bentsen, Section 633a's principal sponsor, said that under 633a, ""government employees will be subject to the same protections against arbitrary employment based on age as are employees in the private sector."" Now, we've had some discussion about the Civil Service Reform Act, and I actually think it's very instructive here to the interpretive question.
I'd like to point out two specific provisions in that, I think, that are relevant. The first one actually isn't in our briefs, so I'm going to take a minute here to describe it because it's a provision of the CSRA that specifically cross-references, incorporates, and describes Section 633a in the text of the statute.
And what you'll see in that provision is that it uses language to describe 633a that is parallel to the language that you find in the private sector provisions. So I think it underscores that these are just different ways of seeing the same thing. And I'm referring to 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1)(B), and here's what it says: ""Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority, discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of age, as prohibited under 633a."" So it doesn't have any of the language that my friends on the other side rely on. Textually, this is a statute that Congress has enacted that in its text is describing 633a and it uses language that's parallel to the private sector provisions. And I think it's highly relevant to interpreting 633a because as Justice Scalia explained is in -- in his opinion in Branch against Smith, it is ""of course the most rudimentary rule of statutory construction, that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation but in the context of the corpus juris of which they are a part, including later enacted statutes."" So -- so -- so if an employer has an explicit younger-is-better policy, Mr. Martinez says your position would allow that to stand for an -- an employee could not get injunctive relief against that. What's -- what's your answer to that? So a couple responses, Your Honor.
First, that employee would be treated exactly the same as if he or she worked for a state or local government or a private employer.
No different than anyone else covered by Title VII. Secondly, that actually goes to the other provision of the Civil Service Reform Act that I was going to refer the Court to, which is cited in our brief, and that's 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(2) which says that: ""All employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to age."" It underscores that 633a -- So just to be clear, would that policy be a violation of that civil service provision? If -- yeah, I think it clearly would be a -- a violation of the civil service provision. And would there be any impediments to suing under that civil service provision? Your Honor, there is a very comprehensive scheme for bringing these types of complaints in the Federal Government.
I am quite confident that there is an avenue in which you could challenge a -- oh, a younger-is-better policy were a federal governmental agency -- So for a -- -- should adopt such a policy. -- a statute that intended to reflect the equal protection clause of the Constitution, which would have covered this on its own prior to the enactment of the statute, you're now saying Congress intended instead to give litigants less Constitutional protection, less protection, not more, or equal. No -- no, Your Honor, not -- And second, you intend on the -- like private sector discrimination or unlike private sector discrimination under be Title VII, Congress intended to give federal employees when it used the phrase ""free from any discrimination,"" it decided to say this kind of discrimination's okay under this provision. So, Your Honor, I think I disagree with that for a couple of reasons. First, I think I disagree with the premise.
If Congress had in fact intended to apply equal protection principles, it presumably would have applied the same standard to state governments since they're subject to the same equal protection principles that the Federal Government is. There's no evidence that Congress was more concerned about the Federal Government than the state governments.
Quite to the contrary. Unfortunately -- And here everyone agrees the states are subject to the same -- General, unfortunately you're wrong because the EEOC and the civil service agency have been reading that equal procession principle even before this provision into federal decisionmaking. So I think -- And I -- I'm not sure how I understand your point. Well, I think that -- I don't think they were -- if they wanted to follow the state and local provision they would have followed it. Right.
I think that -- But they created a different and totally separate provision, and on top of it they said: That language and our -- that language of the private and state government should not be used to interpret this language that affects the Federal Government. Well, Your Honor, I think the reason why my answer is fully responsive is because the suggestion by my friend on the other side is that somehow when Congress extended Title VII and the ADEA to governmental entities -- and remember, they did it at the same time.
They went from private to private and federal and state governments at the same time.
And when Congress made that step, the argument is that somehow it was meant to embody equal-protection principles. Well, if that were the case, one would have fully expected that they would apply the same equal-protection principles to both the Federal Government and the state governments but everyone here agrees that with respect to state governments, it's the but-for causation standard that applies. Isn't there a -- there is a federalism concern, when you're dealing with state and local governments, which you don't have when you're dealing with the Federal Government alone, and why wouldn't -- the language as Mr. Martinez pointed out is different.
You're treating all those extra words as just a meaningless surplus. If they wanted to -- to -- to -- be the same standard as for private sector employment, state and local government employment, they would have used the same language, but they didn't.
They said all -- Right. -- and they said, what were the words? ""Free from any."" ""Free from any,"" yes. So if Congress uses those different -- different, more encompassing language, all free from any, I would think that the standard that's before us, applicable to federal employment, is a more plaintiff-friendly standard. So, Your Honor, two responses on the textual issue, but I'd also like to address the federal -- federalism issue as well. On the textual question, the first is I'd simply point back to that provision of the Civil Service Reform Act that I was referring to earlier, 2302(b) -- Well, call me -- -- (1)(B). -- old fashioned, General, but it seems to me that the first and clearly the most important place to go in thinking about what 633 means, is to go to 633 -- Right. -- and not to go to some later enacted statute in a completely different set of provisions. So I think, you know, Justice Ginsburg's question holds.
It would have been perfectly easy for Congress to have written the same kind of statute that it wrote in Gross or in Nassar.
Indeed they didn't even have to write a statute.
They could have just put the U.S. Government in with the state and locals in the private sector provision.
And they did none of that. They -- they enacted a very different kind of statute which puts the -- the language that your brief primarily relies on, which is based on or because of, in a completely different place in the statute modifying a completely different noun. So why would they have done that if they just meant to write a Gross/Nassar statute? Yeah, I -- I'd like to straight on address the textual argument first and then the why question second. The textual argument first is suppose you had a statute that said: All cakes shall be made free from the use of any eggs.
In the course of the cake baking process, I whisk up a bowl of eggs, I think about dumping it into the batter, but then I say, oh, I'm beat -- supposed to me making a -- a cake without eggs, so I throw it in the trash. I have made a cake free from the use of any eggs, notwithstanding my use of eggs in the cake baking process because the final cake that I have baked is free from the use of eggs. Well, that -- I -- I mean, that gets to the point I -- I asked Mr. Martinez about.
But what if there is a little bit of egg that's put in the final batter? That's the problem. So even if we focus right on -- just on the actual decisionmaking process, the moment of the decisionmaking process, I don't know about the why, and I'm not sure I care about the why here, but I have a terrible time fitting your argument into the statutory language. Can you explain how you can do that? Sure. If -- if -- if age is considered, is a factor in the -- in making the decision, there's discrimination based on age and the -- the -- the action is not done free from discrimination based on age. For -- for two reasons, Your Honor.
First, I'm focusing on the word ""made"" and ""made"" refers to the point at which the action is taken.
Was the personnel action that you ultimately took made without discrimination based on age. And it is if it's exactly the same as you would have made without any consideration of age.
But I'm -- my second point I think is just as important and it refers to a very important canon of construction, that statutory text does not override common law rules unless it does so explicitly. And I think what my cake baking hypothetical does is that it shows that at the very least there's nothing in this text that explicitly overrides the common law default rule. Why -- And if that's the case, you're governed -- Why -- keep going. -- you're governed by the common default rule. The why question is still hanging, which is why -- Yes. -- would Congress use this different language which is significantly different from the other languages -- Sure.
And I think one answer is -- and, look, I've scoured the legislative history and I haven't found anything that specifically addresses it one way or the other.
But I think the most obvious reason is that there is a long and preexisting separate federal process governing federal employment. And the reason they didn't just amend ""employer"" to include the Federal Government is because they wanted to -- to preserve that preexisting separate federal process that applies to federal employees but doesn't apply to private employees -- I -- I -- -- for state and local governments. I can -- I better read that one, which I will.
Look, I'm trying to think of where could this come up.
A promotion, the promoting person thinks I see her result on this test.
It's highly subjective. I'm not sure, but I certainly don't want people who are over the age of 82, et cetera. (Laughter.) You say okay.
So -- Nobody here -- -- There he is. -- thinks that, Your Honor. It's flashing around in his mind.
And -- and so he ends up -- yeah, no, the answer is no.
Okay? That's the possible real-world situation.
But, more likely, it's also a question of lawyers and burdens of proof.
And -- and under the Title VII, you know, what they ended up saying is, hey, lawyer, you show discrimination is really around here, and you will win unless they come in and show no but-for, no but-for, in which case you still win something. All right.
Now, the language here seems designed to do just that, to deal with that real-world situation where we don't understand, as a lawyer, what that real-world situation -- because it's in his head, you know, and -- and just prove that.
And now I'll tell you what happens. Right. He can come back and say, no, not a but-for.
And then you limit the remedies.
What word does that? There is a statutory word that does that.
It's in 33 (a). It's called appropriate remedies.
And so if it really is a but-for, as shown by the lawyer, Ah hey, they're not going to reinstate, they're not going to give her the promotion because, by the way, she comes in very late.
Okay? So now we've got the language.
That's what they're arguing.
And you say why would Congress do that? Why would it make the Feds have to do this? For the same reason they passed that statute.
The feds should be the leader in this.
It's not enough.
The Federal Government should be the leader.
So we have states, private, not just federalism, but who fought more than any group of people for freedom from discrimination? Look at history.
It was the Federal Government, and they should be holier than, okay? Right. So we have a reason. We have an interpretation of the statute.
Now, that in my mind is what you're up against. And -- and I fully understand that, Your Honor, and I think it actually illustrates what I think is one of the more troubling parts of the argument of my friends on the other side, because their argument really boils down to the notion that, in 1974, Congress somehow predicted the 1991 civil rights amendments, not just the motivating factor standard or potentially something significantly broader, any consideration, but the limitation on remedies and the burden shifting.
And it did all of that 20 years earlier when it used the ""free from any"" language. With all respect I find that simply implausible, given that it took us Price Waterhouse, Congress's reaction to that, and a whole bunch of other decisions in order to come up with the motivating factor test.
So I think, Your Honor, what you laid out makes perfectly sensible policy.
I don't think it makes any sense in interpreting -- I think, General, that overstates what a complicated concept this is. I mean, there are two kinds of concepts you can use.
There are: Did this thing actually cause the firing or the lack of promotion? Or was this thing around when they made that decision? And, you know, those are the two basic choices, and some statutes make one choice and some statutes make another choice.
So it's not a whole lot to predict or anticipate. Right. It's just those are your two choices, and you look to the language of the statute to decide which kind of statute we're talking about. Yeah, and I guess I'd add to the mix a third choice, which is the ""motivating factor"" test.
I can sort of see how, textually, you could get to the ""any consideration"" test.
I disagree with it, but I can understand how you can get there textually. I think there's no way that you can get from this text to the ""motivating factor"" text.
And under the ""any consideration"" test -- No way.
No way. Linguistically -- And -- and if Your Honor -- -- the personnel action, the personnel action shall be made ""free from"" something, ""free from"" something.
Hey, from what? From discrimination based on age. So ""free from"" means that that bad thing had to play a role, and that role could either be a motivating factor role in which there were a lot of things in that decisionmaker's head, and -- or it could be you have to show but-for.
See? So which is it? Well -- It says ""free from."" So, obviously, my answer is but-for, but the point that I was trying to make was that under the ""any consideration"" test, which is my friend's test and focuses solely on process, suppose you've got some low-level hiring official that says to his boss: I don't think we should hire this person for 10 reasons, one of which is I just think this person is too old.
The boss then says: You knucklehead, we never consider age. By the way, you're fired for making such a rookie error.
Takes over the file, reviews it, says, well, he was actually right on the bottom line; this person isn't qualified, so we don't hire them.
Age has clearly played a role in the process for making that decision. And under their -- Well -- - -- standard -- -- in the process, but not in the actual decision.
So if you focus just on the decision -- this comes back to your egg hypothetical.
If there's a little bit of egg in the actual decision, that's one thing. But in you threw out the egg before you ever got to that point -- Right. -- then that's a different situation. What I would say is if there's a little bit of egg in it, then it would be a but-for cause but maybe not the sole but-for cause.
But if there is -- if you make the exact same cake you would have made, that is the cake that you would have made if you hadn't whisked up the eggs and held it in the first place, you have made a cake free from the use of eggs even though it's been part of the process; it's not found its way into the final cake. Can I -- can I ask about the practicalities of this case and how it's going to apply -- Sure. -- in the real world? Because I'm not sure there's really much difference.
They agree that you can't -- that an employee can't get reinstatement or back pay without showing but-for cause.
So you obviously agree with that as well. Yes. They would say you can get injunctive relief, however, against practices, policies, things, statements, conditions, even if they weren't a but-for cause of a particular action. You, too, agree with that, albeit under the civil surface -- civil service statutes. Yeah. Right? Basically, yeah. So there's no disagreement, as I understand it, between the two parties about how this is really going to work in the real world going forward.
The only disagreement is about which statute is cited when injunctive relief is sought. Well, I think there are a couple of big differences.
One, it is done administratively.
One, it's being done by hauled into court.
And I think that's a pretty big difference.
Secondly, in the hypothetical that you're spinning out, you're essentially entitled to judicial relief in the absence of an adverse personnel action that was actually caused by -- Would -- -- the thing that you're complaining about.
So -- But you would say, under the civil service statutes, that fair and equity provision that we've gone over -- Yeah. -- for the same kinds of employment condition issues, you could get injunctive relief, which is exactly what Mr. Martinez is seeking here -- Um-hum. -- albeit under a different statute.
And maybe you're right, there's some -- Yeah.
That's a -- -- different hurdles you have to go through, but in terms of employees, the real world of employees and the real world -- world of employers, I think there's a lot of agreement between the two. I think that's basically right because the things that he is concerned about, the types of policies that he's concerned about, couldn't happen within the Federal Government because of a whole host of laws, wholly apart from Section 633a.
But I think that the critical issue is whether -- does -- does 633a provide yet an additional avenue where the Federal Government can be hauled into court for a judicial remedy? An additional avenue -- And that's the point where we disagree. Sorry to interrupt, but an additional avenue that would get you nothing more, though. Exactly, an additional avenue -- Yeah. -- that would get you nothing more for the plaintiff, but that does create a significant headache for the Federal Government -- Mr. General, the problem is, even though there was no anticipating Price Waterhouse and the 1991 litigation, it would also be much more consistent with the statute as the whole, because public sector, state, and Federal Government employees are ending up essentially with the same remedy for all the reasons that Justice Breyer said, which is even though we can't read motivating factor, it's really the same as a part of the decisionmaking, and private sector and state government claimants under Title VII are entitled to injunctive relief, et cetera, if they prove it was a motivating factor. Not under the ADEA, Your Honor.
The Court held in Nassar -- And I do -- and I do -- -- that -- But under Title VII, yes -- Well, Your Honor, under Title VII and -- and I'd like to clarify this because our position on Title VII is a little bit more nuanced than that.
Under the Title VII federal sector sex discrimination or race discrimination provisions, as distinct from the Title VII federal sector retaliation provision, which we sought cert on and this Court denied cert on.
If you look at the federal sector sex, race provision, arguably that does incorporate the motivating factor standard because there is a provision in the federal sector Title VII that specifically cross-references portions of the '91 civil rights amendments that apply the ""motivating factor"" test. And if that's right, Your Honor, this Court has never addressed it.
We haven't -- we did not contest that below.
But if that's right, then everybody that -- under Title VII gets treated by the same motivating factor standard under Title VII.
So that takes -- would take care of all of the race and sex hypotheticals that my friend is troubled by. But critically, 633a doesn't cross-reference any portion of the 1991 civil rights amendments at all.
So I think that further confirms that the text of 633a is not meant to adopt the ""motivating factor"" standard but is something different.
And the different things is, is the common law default rule, unless there's something in the statutory text that clearly abrogates the common law default rule. I'm not going to say that they don't have any textual argument.
I think they have a -- a decent textual argument.
The question is: Do they have a textual argument that is sufficiently strong to override the common law default rule of but-for causation? And the reason why I lean heavily on my cake baking eggs hypothetical is because I think that at the very least shows that this statutory language is easily susceptible to my interpretation.
And once I've met that standard, it's governed by the common law default rule of but-for causation. Now, I think that my friend may get up on rebuttal and point to Chevron and so I would like to take one moment to address the Chevron issue in -- in advance.
I think Chevron would be completely inapplicable here for three different reasons: The first is, before you ever get to Chevron, you apply the canons of construction. And here the canon of construction is that you interpret language to be governed by the common law default rule if there is any ambiguity.
So if there were ambiguity, we win under the default rule, not Chevron. Let's say you completely disagree with that.
Chevron doesn't apply for two additional reasons.
First, as this Court held in Epic Systems, Chevron doesn't apply where two Executive Branch agencies disagree on the meaning of a statute, since it's inconsistent with Chevron's political accountability rationale.
And here we have such a -- a disagreement. Secondly, as the Court held in the Ledbetter decision, Chevron doesn't apply where the Executive -- where the agency is simply interpreting this Court's decisions, since this Court is the expert at interpreting its decisions. And if you look at the EEOC adjudications in this area, the analysis tends to be quite short, it's usually about a paragraph, and all it's doing is interpreting this Court's decisions. So I think we win under the text, regardless of Chevron, but even if you think that Chevron in theory might apply here, there are two additional reasons it couldn't apply in this particular case. Mr. -- Mr. Martinez is making a distinction that -- between liability and remedy.
And he said, the bottom line, you don't get the job if somebody else was better qualified.
Nonetheless, you do get some kind of remedy so that the workplace will be free from all discrimination, any discrimination. So one possibility is injunctive relief.
We will not take age into account.
And there are other possibilities.
So -- but you seem to think everything is driven by the end result that you are not entitled to the job if, even though the age was taken into account, the person who got the job was better qualified. Your Honor, I think you're fairly characterizing my position and I'd say a couple of things on remedy. If you disagree with me on liability, I agree with them on remedy, but I also think that his position on remedy is unnecessary for the reasons of -- of my exchange with Justice Kavanaugh. You can -- you -- you essentially already have a civil -- civil service system that provides the type of relief that my friend on the other side would seek since there are a host of civil service regulations that would prohibit the types of policies that he's concerned about, even if there wasn't somebody -- a particular person in court that was challenging it under Section 633a. But our bottom line position here is that Congress added the federal and state sector extension of 633 in the Title VII at the same time.
It meant to apply the same standard to the Federal Government that applies to state and local governments and it applies to private employers. That standard is but-for causation. It results in treating all employees under the ADEA the same regardless of who you work for, since everybody agrees if you work for a private company or a state and local government, the standard is but-for causation and, respectfully, that's the thing -- the standard that we think should apply to the Federal Government as well. Unless the Court has further questions, Your Honor. Thank you, Counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Martinez. Just a few points, Your Honor.
Let me start with the text. I think it's very notable that when the Solicitor General stood up here, he began in one of the first sentence -- few sentences of his presentation by misquoting the text.
He said this statute covers ""personnel actions based on age."" He made exactly the mistake that we pointed out -- I pointed out in my initial presentation. That's not what the statute says.
It requires careful attention.
It says, ""shall be made free from any discrimination based on age."" The Solicitor General as to the text says that Congress intended to apply the exact same rules that -- that are applied to private sector employees as under the statute interpreted in Gross. Well, with respect, whatever we know about the text is that Congress did not intend to apply that regime.
Congress specifically considered that regime.
It was -- it was going to do what the Solicitor General wanted in the first draft of the statute.
Congress then amended that draft and passed a different statute.
You just can't -- you can't just apply a different statute that Congress expressly rejected. Secondly, Your Honor, with respect to the constitutional rule, I think if you look at the legislative history of -- of this provision and if you look at the Brown versus GSA decision that we talk about in our brief, it's very clear that Congress, when it enacted Title VII, which -- which uses the same causation language to apply to the federal sector, it was focused on the equal protection problem in the federal sector context. They cite Bolling versus Sharpe.
Both the legislative history and this Court's decision in Brown and makes clear -- both of them make clear that the purpose of this statute was to -- was to capture the same kind of constitutional equal protection injuries that were at stake in the long line of cases that we've cited in our brief. Now, the Solicitor General says there's no reason states should be treated any differently.
Well, again, one thing we know from the text of the statute and from the legislative history is that Congress expressly decided to treat states differently.
They treated states by -- by amending the employer definition.
They treated states like private sector actors.
They did something something totally different by creating a unique federal sector provision to govern the Federal Government.
You can't just pull that language that applies to states and say it must apply to the Federal Government. And Justice Breyer, you're absolutely right, the legislative history shows that Congress thought of the Federal Government's being especially important in this context. The Solicitor General -- this is my third point -- talks about the common law injury rule.
We are -- our rule is fully consistent with the common law rule.
If you look at the -- the Restatement, the common law third Restatement, Section 26, what it says in comment D is that the first thing you need to do when you're addressing the common law rule of causation is figure out what the injury is. What we've argued is that the injury at stake in this case is the same kind of process-based equal protection type injury that this Court has repeatedly identified in cases from Bakke up through Parents Involved.
Once you get the injury right, we are completely consistent with the common law rule. Finally, Your Honor, younger is better.
I think it's striking that the Solicitor General doubled down on his position that a younger-is-better policy does not violate this statute.
His deus ex machina here is Section 2301 of the CSRA.
That's a cruel joke that will be played on -- on this Court if you accept that rationale. Section 2301 is unenforceable. Unenforceable.
I think the Solicitor General said, Justice Kavanaugh, in response to your question, that it would give rise to a remedy of an injunction in court.
That is not accurate. If you look at the MSPB website, it specifically says that -- that this provision is not enforceable and that's the rule that courts across the country have applied. The Solicitor General has had months to come up with a solution to this hypothetical, and the best the Solicitor General can do is come up with a statutory provision that's unenforceable. That puts victims of discrimination in exactly the same position they were in before this statute was enacted, where they had remedies that were not enforceable.
Congress stepped in here.
It passed a broad statute because it wanted to protect these people. Your Honor, I leave you with the statutory text which says very clearly that all federal personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.
A decision that's made by applying a younger-is-better policy, contrary to the Solicitor General, is not made free from any discrimination based on age. You know, I -- I assume, and I hope, that we would not see within any federal agency any sort of policy like younger is -- is better.
And so I'm not sure what practical benefit you are going to provide for in the typical individual age discrimination employment case if you say that the person can't get reinstatement or whatever, absent but-for causation, but there are going to be these other equitable remedies available.
I don't know what kind of injunction would be available -- would be of practical benefit in a case like that. May -- if I may answer? Two quick points, Your Honor.
First of all, I think -- I agree with you, we would not like to see agencies doing these sorts of things.
If you look at the Brenton case that we cite at pages 41 to 42 of our brief, that case involved a -- a written memorandum.
The policy said that someone's ability to control traffic declines with age, and they were treating applicants for those positions badly for that reason. I think -- more broadly, Your Honor, I think the injunctive relief and the prospective remedies that are available are extremely important in -- in the real world, which is precisely why, in the equal protection context, you've recognized the importance of that kind of injunctive relief, and we think that relief is just as important here.
We ask you reverse. Thank you, counsel, General. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-6943, Banister versus Davis. Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed for either of two independent reasons. First, a Rule 59(e) motion filed within 20 days of judgment is part of the first full opportunity to pursue habeas relief.
It is not a second habeas application. In the 50 years between Rule 59's adoption and AEDPA's enactment, there is no record of a court ever treating a timely Rule 59 motion merely seeking reconsideration as though it were a second habeas application.
AEDPA did not change this settled practice, and nothing in this Court's Gonzalez decision suggests otherwise. Rule 60(b) motions present obvious opportunities to circumvent AEDPA's restrictions, as the facts in Gonzalez itself well illustrate.
There, the motion was filed years after the judgment and well after the end of any appellate proceedings. Rule 59(e) motions are different. They have to be filed within 28 days of judgment, they suspend the judgment's finality, and they result in a single appeal. Second, by dismissing Mr. Banister's appeal as untimely, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized him for following the plain terms of Appellate Rule 4(a).
There's no basis in the rule or in AEDPA for retroactively recharacterizing a timely Rule 59(e) motion and treating it as though it were never filed for purposes of Rule 4(a). On this issue, Texas and the United States notably rely on a new argument, as their position is that Mr. Banister's Rule 59 motion shouldn't count because it wasn't filed properly.
But the basic problem with that argument is there's no properly filed requirement in Rule 4(a). And we think this Court should reject the government's invitation to rewrite the plain terms of that rule, which would significantly complicate what is supposed to be a clear, straightforward jurisdictional inquiry and would have implications for all civil proceedings in addition to habeas. I'd like to start with our first argument, and on that issue, our -- our rule is clear.
If a motion is filed when a court still has authority to enter or revise the judgment, before any appeal, it is part of the first habeas proceeding.
As a result, cannot be a second petition.
That -- But the -- but the motion is repetitive of the habeas petition. That is, it's -- and it's made after the entry of judgment.
So, if you were thinking, is -- is this second, yes, it is in the sense that I said it in my habeas petition, and now I'm saying it again in my Rule 59(e) motion.
It's identical argument, and it's repeated a second time. Right.
But we think that can't be the test for what counts as being second or successive.
The Court has noted that ""second or successive"" is a term of art.
So not anything that is literally filed after the first application will be treated as second or successive.
For example, an amended complaint is going to be presenting, you know, claims that could be overlapping again. What if a pro se, within the 28 days, files what is styled as a petition -- as a second petition? We -- we think it probably should be characterized as a Rule 59(e) motion in that context to the extent it is seeking to alter or amend the judgment.
So, no, we don't think that that would be treated as -- as being a second habeas application. It would -- it would have to meet the 28-day -- It would -- it would have to meet the 28-day deadline, and, of course, it wouldn't have the sort of effect under Rule 4(a) for suspending the time to appeal because, to get that suspension, in fact, it actually has to be a motion -- So, basically, what you're saying is that although AEDPA restricts the filing of a second or successive habeas petition, a prisoner can, in effect, file a second or successive habeas petition, indeed, one that is styled as a habeas petition, so long as it's done within 28 days? I mean, I think on our view or their view, there's going to be a cutoff time.
Certainly, a petitioner could file something styled as ""here is my second habeas application"" while the first case is still pending, and every court would treat that as a motion to amend the initial habeas application. So our position is only that while the district court still has authority over its initial judgment, before there's a process to appeal, you would apply the same rule. When we have two rules here, two laws here -- one is the habeas statute which was enacted by Congress; the other is a rule governing habeas proceedings which took effect under the Rules Enabling Act -- are they of equal stature? No.
I mean, of -- the -- the relevant rule here, I think, is Habeas Rule 12, which provides that the Rules of Federal Civil Procedure apply as default unless they are inconsistent with AEDPA, with the statute, or any habeas-specific rule. But since the habeas statute was actually enacted by Congress -- it is a law under the Constitution -- shouldn't we take special care to make sure that it is heeded and not compromise it based on a rule that cannot alter a statute? I -- I certainly agree that the statute gets precedence, but you have to interpret the key term, ""second or successive."" And on that term, this Court has recognized that that's a term of art that basically carried forward pre-AEDPA practice and precedent as sort of relevant to incorporating it. So AEDPA no doubt tightened the restrictions on when a second or successive application could be allowed, both sort of substantively in terms of when it would be allowed and procedurally you have to first go to the court of appeals and get preclearance. But, in terms of what would count as being second or successive in the first place, that's a term of art that basically carries forward.
And the other side has -- has not disagreed with our proposition that there's just no evidence that Rule 59(e) motions, merely seeking reconsideration, were ever treated as successive petitions. Well, why wouldn't -- What if -- -- what -- I'm sorry. I -- I don't know if this is the same question Justice Alito was -- was asking or that you answered, where things that are styled second habeas.
But what if it is exactly the same thing? I mean, I think it may be fairly common with respect to pro se petitioners.
They just take the habeas petition and put another cover on it and say 59(e). Are you still going to treat that as -- as not a second and successive habeas petition? I think within -- you know, our rule is within the 28 days, when the court still has authority because -- and -- and the filing of a motion can suspend the judgment, that, no, we don't think that that should be treated -- How about putting the labels aside a moment? One could argue that restyling the first as a Rule 59(e) is a motion for reconsideration. But how about a totally new claim, one that indisputably is not a reconsideration motion but a motion to amend basically -- Uh-huh. -- to add a claim, something like what happened in the one decision in those 50 years that did say that adding a due process claim was an abuse of the writ, okay? Right. It was not a proper 59(e); it was an abuse of the writ because it was adding a new claim.
What about that situation? So our position is that the right way to think about that is -- is exactly that it is not a proper use of Rule 59(e) and that it is certainly going to fail for that reason, but it should not be treated as a second habeas application if it is filed within that time period. That's how the Third Circuit, for example, in the Blystone decision dealt with that situation.
They said, no, this was -- this was a -- styled as a Rule 59(e) motion.
It was seeking to alter or amend a judgment and including adding new claims.
We don't think that that's a second habeas petition, but, of course, you can't do that under Rule 59.
Rule 59 is not something you're supposed to be using to -- to raise new claims. Now there is a fallback position, Chief Judge Boggs in the Sixth Circuit decision, and his approach was then adopted by the Ninth Circuit, which was to say that if you are basically using -- you know, you use the title Rule 59, but it's clear that's not what you're doing, you're using it to raise a wholly new claim, we think that that would be potentially inconsistent with AEDPA and abusive. Is it -- is -- is -- And it would be jurisdictional I guess in the sense that it would not toll the statute of limitations or the time -- I mean the time to appeal? If it were not a -- if it were not a real Rule 59(e) motion? Yeah, the one you just described, yeah. Well, I think the question about whether it's going to suspend the judgment turns on just whether it is seeking Rule 59(e) relief in terms of whether it is actually seeking to alter or amend the judgment. And if it is also raising arguments that you just can't get under Rule 59, I think that is different. And, you know, this goes to our second argument.
But our position is that even -- on this second piece, even if the motion were jurisdictionally barred, that does not mean that it was not filed and was not pending and was not disposed of as -- as the language used by Rule 4. Well, before you get to that, can we come back to what we can or can't infer from pre-AEDPA practice? In those days, whether to entertain a second or successive petition was within the discretion of the district court. So how natural would it be for a district court in that situation, upon receiving a 59(e) motion, to say before I get to this discretionary question about whether I would entertain this if it was a second or successive petition, I have to decide whether it is something that has to be considered that or can be considered a Rule 59(e) motion. Wouldn't there be a natural tendency for the judge just to jump to the final question about whether the judge is going to entertain it in -- as -- as a discretionary matter? I think that's quite right, but it supports our point because discretion wasn't to be open-ended.
Certainly, after this Court's Coleman decision in 1986 dealing with the ends of justice standard, the idea, you know, a plurality opinion of the Court said you had to make a plausible showing of actual innocence in order to bring a successive petition. Even Justice Stevens in his concurrence said that a showing of actual innocence was relevant to whether the ends -- the ends of justice were satisfied. I think it makes very little sense to think that a -- a petitioner would need to -- merely to seek reconsideration within 10 days of having the order entered is going to need -- make a plausible showing of actual innocence to do that.
So it was not an open-ended the -- the judge could do it for any reason. The end of justice really cabined that discretion.
And there's no reason to think that courts ever thought that that would be the standard, that you would need to satisfy that merely to seek reconsideration. Mr. Burgess, if I'm understanding your argument right, you're basically saying our definition of ""second and successive habeas"" should be defined by whether you had a first full opportunity not just to receive a judgment but to appeal that judgment. Yes, yeah, that it -- it -- that it's the -- that that first judgment, that first habeas terminates at the time in which your appeal terminates -- We don't -- -- the right to it. So there are courts that have taken that position that -- that the first is not over until the whole appellate process completes. Right. We -- we don't think the Court needs to resolve that and it doesn't need to go that far to rule in our favor. Why not? Because, in our situation, the court -- the -- Mr. Banister filed his petition within the 28 days when the district court still had discretion or still had the ability to revise the judgment. And we think that's important because, as a result of the way Rule 59(e) operates in conjunction with appellate Rule 4(a), the filing of it suspends the finality of the judgment.
It means that everything is going to merge into a single appeal? Yes, that's -- I'm sorry.
Then I misspoke when I spoke the way I did.
How would you articulate your rule then? Sure.
The rule that we apply is that if a motion is filed at a time when the court still has authority to enter or amend its judgment before any potential appeal, it's still part of the first habeas proceeding rather than a second application. Is my recollection correct then -- please do tell me it's not if it isn't -- that Rule 59 motions are discretionary in terms of their treatment by the district court and reviewed by -- for abuse of discretion by -- by the courts of appeals? That's the correct standard of review, that's right.
In terms of like what the substantive standard is for granting a Rule 59(e) motion, it's supposed to be stringent.
It is not a basis just to -- you have to show a significant error or -- or potentially an intervening decision that changes the issue. So, if it's -- it's just an appended repetition of the complaint -- Right. -- there's never going to be an abuse of discretion? It would be very unlikely for there to be an abuse of discretion to refuse to -- To deny the motion? Yeah, to deny it. No, that's quite -- that's quite right.
And I think, you know, the -- the other side complains about the potential burdens that district courts would face.
But we think the way that the rule operates and the fact that the motions have to be filed within 28 days to a judge who has just ruled on the merits of the proceeding, the judge is going to be able to quickly determine whether there is anything new here, whether there's any there there to the complaint that he or she made a significant mistake. In this case, the -- the judge acted on Mr. Banister's Rule 59(e) motion within five days before the state was even required to respond.
So we don't think there was any burden.
And -- Mr. Burgess, were you finished? Sorry. Sure, Justice Kagan. Your friends on the other side cite Crosby, Gonzalez v. Crosby, and -- and note that there was no distinction made there between petitions -- Rule 60(b) petitions that were filed within the 28 days and after the 28 days. So what is your response to that? Is it -- is it a feature of your argument that a Rule 60(b) motion even within the 28 days would be treated differently from a Rule 59 motion? Well, no.
We -- we think that anything filed within 28 days is -- is subject to our rule.
And -- and the reason for that is Rule 60(b) motions that are filed within 20 days -- 28 days are treated under the rules effectively as though they are Rule 59(e) motions.
That is the way the rules were adopted, because prior to, I think, the 1993 amendments, there was real confusion about -- courts were faced with the question, is this a 60(b) motion, is this a Rule 59(e) motion, and it's hard to tell the difference. Some courts have adopted a bright-line rule that anything filed within the 28 days is going to be treated as though it is a 59(e) motion.
And that's the position the Rules Committee adopted and it makes it clear in the Advisory Committee notes that Rule 60(b) is on the list within 4(a). So all courts are doing that now, they essentially convert -- whatever you label it, they treat it as a Rule 59 motion? Certainly for purposes of the timing to appeal.
I mean, the -- the standards between them are quite overlapping. And -- and a lot of instances, of course, we're dealing with pro se petitioners who might not label it in either event.
They say motion to reconsider or -- or something to that effect. And it -- it's treated as a Rule 59 if it's within the 28 days. And does it bother you at all that, say, a Rule 60(b) motion filed on the 29th day will be treated very differently from the Rule 59 motion? It doesn't because the rules set that up to have different effects.
If the motion is filed after 28 days, the district court no longer has authority to amend the judgment.
It's not going to be something that suspends the finality of the judgment and allows for a single appeal. So it creates a risk of piecemeal litigation that AEDPA's designed to prevent that if something is filed within the 28-day period would not.
I mean, of course, under either side's approach, there's going to be a question of the day after, you know, what counts as being -- is the first proceeding having ended and -- and the second having started. Can you -- can you address the Solicitor General's reference to 2266 and how you would respond to that argument? Sure.
So, I mean, of course, 2266 is a provision that's never actually been in use because it's the -- the opt-in provision.
As I understand their argument, they say that because there are specific deadlines that are listed for different sorts of motions, but Rule 59 is not on the list, that that means it should be excluded from the statute. Well, that's not consistent with their own position, because they recognize that Rule 59(e) motions are permissible.
Their -- their position is that only if it is raising a claim within the meaning of Gonzalez would it -- would it present a potential issue. So the fact that they're not specifically enumerated there can't prove any -- or it would simply prove too much because it's contrary to their own position. We -- the way we would handle that is to the -- if 2266 were ever operationalized and if its deadlines ever sort of went into effect, one could reasonably make an argument that in that specific context, perhaps Rule 59(e) motions, and all Rule 59(e) motions, not specifically ones that raise Gonzalez claims, maybe those would be inconsistent with the text of the statute or with -- with the text of the statute.
But that doesn't suggest that all Rule 59(e) motions outside of that context are going to be inconsistent. Why is your position favorable to habeas petitioners in general? Wouldn't it be easier for them just to ask for a certificate of appealability? Certainly, they can do that.
We think the reason, you know, this Court has recognized in other contexts that Rule 59(e) motions are useful is because they provide an opportunity to quickly correct potential errors and to avoid the whole appeal process, even in the -- you know, we acknowledge that those actual orders changing the outcome are -- are -- are rare, but less rare is a decision that clarifies the basis for the decision and might clarify the grounds for an appeal and make things go smoother. I think the flip side of that I do want to comment on is that we believe the other side's position is much -- going to be much more inefficient, sort of perversely, even though they argue that their approach is designed to streamline the -- the habeas review process, because, under their approach, any time a Rule 59(e) motion is filed, a judge cannot just look at it and say: I don't see anything here. Denied. Instead, the judge has to make a threshold inquiry to determine, is there something that constitutes a habeas claim within the meaning of Gonzalez? In some instances, that might be simple; in others, not so much. And after the court makes that determination, it then has to decide, well, suppose this is a mixed, you know, Rule 59(e) motion in the sense that it raises some things that are claims but some things that are not because it goes into the integrity of the federal proceeding.
There's no clarity under the other side's approach how the court is supposed to handle that. If it is something that raises a claim, rather -- again, rather than simply having the motion denied and moving on with the appellate process, what happens is that the motion would be transferred to the court of appeals, which then has to take its new independent look to determine whether the requirements of 2244(b) are satisfied. And we think it would just be -- it's much more efficient for a court that has just ruled on a motion -- and, by its nature, a Rule 59(e) motion has to be filed immediately after the judgment -- to be able to review it and, if there's nothing there, deny it, and then the process can move forward with the certificate of appealability. And if there is something there or if there's something that needs to be clarified, the judge can do that as well, and that can greatly make the appellate process more efficient. But AEDPA was intended to move habeas petitions along quickly and is full of deadlines.
But there is no deadline for a ruling on a 59(e) motion.
Isn't that an anomaly? There's no deadline for ruling on a habeas petition either.
We don't see any reason to think that a district judge who has just invested the time to rule on the habeas petition is for some reason going to spend a lot of time with a Rule 59(e) motion that has been just filed. And, again, I keep emphasizing that it has to be filed promptly.
That cannot be changed -- under Rule -- Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), there can be no extensions to the 28-day deadline for filing a Rule 59(e) motion.
So there's no way to avoid it being something that -- that moves quickly. And to return to the point I was making at the outset, that's quite different from the situation in Gonzalez, where you have a Rule 60(b) motion that can be filed years after the judgment and presents obvious opportunities to circumvent AEDPA's restrictions by reopening cases that would otherwise be closed, unless you could satisfy 2244. And that's why we think Gonzalez just -- just does not speak to the key question here. There, there was no -- there's no doubt that the first proceeding had ended.
So the only question the Court faced was whether the 60(b) motion could be close enough, similar enough to a new habeas application that it would be inconsistent with the statute not to subject it to 2244(b). Here, the question is different.
It's whether this motion is part of the first habeas proceeding.
And it has always been treated that way.
And we see no reason for -- no basis in AEDPA to displace that settled practice. I did want to turn again to our argument about Appellate Rule 4(a) because I do want to emphasize that it is a distinct argument.
We think that even if Section 2244(b) were relevant in the sense that it -- it barred someone from pursuing 59(e) relief that raised a claim and prevented the district judge from acting upon it, it would not mean that the rule -- that Rule 4(a) did not apply to suspend the judgment. And the reason for that is that the -- the relevant requirement is that the -- the motion be filed, not that it be properly filed, not that it be filed with -- in a court with jurisdiction.
So, under the plain text of a rule -- of the rule, if a motion is filed improperly in a court that lacks jurisdiction, it nonetheless has been filed because it was received, and it nonetheless has been disposed of. Rule 4(a) uses the term ""disposed of,"" not denied.
If it -- if it used ""denied,"" it might be reasonable for the other side to argue that, well, the judge can't deny a motion that he doesn't have jurisdiction to entertain.
But he quite clearly -- a judge quite clearly can dispose of a motion that was -- that was filed that the judge lacked jurisdiction to entertain. And we think it -- it does not make sense to rewrite the plain terms of Appellate Rule 4(a) in a way that is going to make it such that individuals like Mr. Banister, often pro se litigants who are following the plain terms of the text, are -- nonetheless lose their ability to pursue their first habeas appeal because a court, a year after the motion was filed, decides, well, this was actually close enough to a habeas petition that we're not going to give the benefit of Rule 4(a) and we are going to treat it as -- as untimely.
We don't think that is consistent with the statute. If the Court has no further questions, I'll reserve to rebuttal. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hawkins. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A ruling for Banister would give every habeas petitioner the right to file a second round of merits briefing, demand a second decision on his claims, extend automatically his deadline to appeal, and delay the repose of his sentence.
That result is contrary to the text and purpose of AEDPA and this Court's decision in Gonzalez. The second or successive bar applies to Rule 59(e) motions for at least three reasons.
The first is text.
Just like Rule 60(b) motions, 59(e) motions are post-judgment vehicles to present habeas claims.
And when a Rule 59(e) motion presents claims that have already been rejected by a final judgment, the motion is necessarily a second or successive habeas application for the same reasons that a Rule 60(b) motion would be. Second is precedent.
There's no sound reason to have one rule under Gonzalez for 60(b) motions and a categorical exception for 59(e) motions.
Both can present habeas claims, and both are filed after final judgment. The third is AEDPA's purposes.
As Justice Alito pointed out, AEDPA exists to promote finality and to streamline proceedings by moving cases along to their next stage. That's why Habeas Rule 11 allows a petitioner to seek reconsideration of the district court's order denying a certificate of appealability, but it also provides that such a motion for reconsideration does not extend the notice of appeal deadline.
Yet, according to Banister, he could thwart that rule by simply attacking the merits of the judgment and thereby grant himself an extension that Rule 11 would otherwise deny. For these reasons, the Court should hold that a -- that the second or successive bar applies with full force to 59(e) motions.
And that rule requires affirmance here.
Banister acknowledges that his 59(e) motion presented habeas claims and that those claims had been rejected by the previous final judgment. May -- may I ask, your introductory statement, this will -- will be -- give an opportunity to file new briefs and all that, but that's not what happened here. The 59(e) motion was filed, and I think it was denied, what, five days later, and there were no briefings.
The judge had just denied the habeas.
This was a repetition of what was in the habeas.
Had no problem disposing of it swiftly. So I don't see all the additional briefing that you -- you said at the outset of your argument. Well, Your Honor, first, there was an extension that Banister effectively granted himself.
That extension in this case was only five days.
But, again, as Justice Alito pointed out, there's no deadline for ruling on a 59(e) motion.
Other habeas petitioners may get much longer extensions. Banister's 59(e) motion was 30-some pages, and it asked the district court to redo its work on 14 different claims that he'd raised in his original filings. But the district court had just ruled on the same thing, and it had no problem -- And in this case, Justice Ginsburg, it's true that the district court was able to dispose of that relatively quickly, but it's worth noting that Banister's original motions practice in district court totaled almost a thousand pages of material, much of which was stylized as a stage play complete with stage directions. If he'd simply refiled that thousand pages' worth of material stylized as a Rule 59(e) motion, it likely would have taken the district court much longer to go through that and figure out whether there's any -- Or it might have taken the district court no time at all.
I mean, you -- you file a stylized play, a thousand pages of a stylized play, twice, I would think the second time around, the district court might be righteously indignant and have very little trouble denying that. And isn't that -- I mean, if -- if you want to talk about equities and efficiencies, I -- I -- I would appreciate some response to the argument that we've already heard, and you're well aware of, that this is more efficient than allowing the court of appeals -- forcing the court of appeals to have to -- you bounce it upstairs -- you're asking the district court judge, instead of ruling on what he well knows to be a very overlong and bad play for a second time, sending it to the court of appeals to decide what to do with, and the court of appeals then has to decide whether it's a true Rule 59 or a fake one, I suppose, and -- and that, in the 60(b) context, has proven to be a not inconsiderable burden. So you tell me who -- who's got the better of the efficiencies? Well, Justice Gorsuch, we've got the better of the efficiencies argument because AEDPA is about moving cases along to the next stage.
And by burdening the district courts with yet another motion, presenting a whole bunch of habeas claims, many of which have been rejected already, is simply delaying the process further because it's granting him an extension on his NOA deadline according to -- How do you deal with just -- just look at Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(14), if a party timely files -- it doesn't say properly files -- it says timely files a motion to alter or amend the judgment, the time to file an appeal from the judgment runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion. Why isn't that instruction dispositive of this case? Well, Your Honor, this Court has recognized that baked into that is a requirement that the motion satisfy the preconditions to filing.
For example, we see in FCC versus League of Women Voters that if you file a 59(e) motion that doesn't go to the objects of Rule 59, that it's not actually filed, and it doesn't extend your notice of appeal deadline. And the courts of appeals have recognized that as well in 59(e) contexts.
For example, the Tenth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge McConnell in a case called Allender versus Raytheon, noted that a Rule 59(e) motion that did not comply with Rule 7's pleading requirements is not actually filed and does not have any effect on the notice of appeal deadline. That settled rule flows from cases like Morse, which this Court decided a number of decades ago. But you're -- you're defeating your own point.
Do you have any statistics to show how long 59(e) motions actually take to adjudicate? I mean, I can't rely on my personal experience, but mine was not different than what happened in this case, very quick, that there were decisions, but do you have any proof that there's actually an abuse of 59(e) so that it extends the appeal time inordinately? Well, Justice Sotomayor, two answers to that.
First, as to statistics, we don't have any because many of these 59(e) decisions don't make it into a database where you could add them up and count them.
But the second point is you -- you don't -- Suggesting they're not very long. I don't think that's correct, Justice Sotomayor.
And you don't have to take my word for it.
Let me direct the Court's attention to a case out of the Southern District of Alabama called Aird versus United States, it's 339 F. Supp. 2d at 1311, the district court there laments the use of 59(e) motions for the senseless rehashing of frivolous arguments the courts have already rejected.
And there are many district courts that cite that decision to express their frustration with this process -- Well, we can -- I don't know if we can find that out, but, I mean, intuitively, I do not have that experience, but there are judges on this bench who do have the experience of being a district judge, so I guess they'll have a view. Absent the agree, I'm thinking first there's one appeal.
It doesn't give you an extra appeal of 59.
So the issue in front of us is, is a Rule 59 motion part of the same case, the first habeas that you brought, or is it a new thing? Is it second or successive? That's the question. You agree, I take it, that Judge says we're not going to have 15 witnesses because of. Next day, lawyer says: Judge, you forgot the word ""not"" in there.
Oh, my God.
Now everybody agrees you should be able to do that, right? Okay. Because that's before final judgment, Justice Breyer. Well, is that the reason, or is it because it's an efficient way of getting the judge to correct his own errors? You don't have to answer that, but what I'm thinking of is you're right, that if 59 does about the same thing after the final judgment, in 28 days, most of them will be dismissed, 28-day extension, 20-day extension.
But let's look at the ones that are granted. Now the judge says: My God, I made a mistake, et cetera.
Which is more likely? Is it more likely if you keep those cases out of the court of appeals that the system is all going to take much longer because the guy's going to bring it up on appeal and everybody will have to deal with this kind of thing, or is it going to be shorter if the person who made the decision deals with it initially? That was the last argument you heard. And I would have thought to have the judge who made the initial decision very quickly correct it will save time, rather than saying: Judge, you are forbidden to correct what you see as a mistake of yourself and we're going to go to the appeals court. Well, Justice Breyer, if you -- That was his argument, I think.
And I think it was brought up again roughly.
And I want to hear what the answer is. Well, Justice Breyer, a few things in response.
Number one, to the extent there's a policy judgment that needs to be made here, Congress has made that in 2244(b) and that's conclusive. To the extent that there are errors that the district court needs to correct, Rule -- No, 2244(b), I thought, has these words ""second or successive."" And the issue in front of us is, is the 59(b) second or successive, or is it part of the same case during a 28-day period, you can -- it's not too late -- get that judgment amended, and that's part of the same case.
That's the issue. I don't see here the words decided. So I'd like you to go back to what I think was Justice Gorsuch's question -- point, what I think was the last point raised here and certainly was what my basic point was. Justice Breyer, if the concern is efficiency in correcting errors, Rule 60(a) allows the district court to correct clerical errors.
The rule that we're advocating today I don't think would touch most of those cases.
To the extent you're saying there's a clerical error, we don't object to the district court fixing that because that's not a habeas claim. There are -- there are other things besides clerical errors, though, right? And what do we do -- I guess what was instructive to me was the historian's brief and that the difference between 60 and 59 is a dichotomy that's pretty ancient and that trial courts have since time out of mind, I guess, had the authority to amend their judgments to correct errors, not just clerical ones but other significant ones that they wished to, so long as the court's in session. And -- and that is the end, when it divests itself, when it finishes its term, that's when it goes off to the court of appeals, and that that's what 59 and 60 were aimed to mimic. I think, Justice Gorsuch, the best place to draw that line is at the final judgment.
In any civil litigation, the final judgment is what determines the parties' rights and obligations relative to one another.
It can immediately form -- I understand that. I understand that.
But you have to -- I'm asking you to deal with the history, which is that that's not the case, right? The history was that after final judgment, so long as the trial court was sitting, it had an opportunity to fix its errors, substantive as well as clerical.
And you've already admitted clerical.
So why not really egregious errors as well? I would have thought that you would -- if -- if you're conceding clerical errors can be corrected during the equivalent term of the court, you'd want egregious ones too. Well, Your Honor, in -- in enacting 2244, Congress made the decision that whatever the history might have been, it wants this going to the court of appeals.
AEDPA does not just simply codify all the old abuse of the writ doctrine, as Justice Thomas wrote for the Court in -- for -- for his opinion in Magwood, Justice Scalia's opinion in McQuiggin versus Perkins. Well, I thought that that -- AEDPA -- -- was not the precedent of this Court, Mr. Hawkins, that with respect to the meaning of ""second and successive"" as compared to many, many other things that AEDPA did that were departures from what had preceded it, but that with respect to the meaning of ""second and successive,"" this Court has said multiple times that we are going to look back to the history. And the history suggests what Justice Gorsuch says it did, that Rule 60 motions were treated very differently from Rule 59 motions. Well, Your Honor, the Court in Gonzalez didn't look to history at all. It started with the plain text of AEDPA.
It said, what's a claim? What's an application? Is it second or successive? It didn't discuss the abuse of the writ doctrine, didn't look to common law, didn't look to the equity of rules. But 60 -- 60(b) is a discrete proceeding, and it results in a separate appeal from the ruling.
59(e) is so tightly tied to that first judgment, I mean, if -- if the -- if the motion is denied, then that disposition merges into the final judgment and you have one, not two documents, from which you appeal. So it's -- a denial of 59(e) motion, what you're left with is an appeal from the first habeas.
So how can it be successive or second if it is so tightly pinned to the first habeas petition and the disposition merges into that final judgment? Well, two responses, Justice Ginsburg. First, I think the same thing would be true of a 60(b) filed within 28 days.
And second -- Yes, and I think that that was conceded, that that is the equivalent of 59(e). Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, I'll ask you to look at the way AEDPA treats the final judgment.
In Habeas Rule 11, AEDPA requires the district court in the final judgment, the same time it issues final judgment, the district court has to say whether it's granting a certificate of appealability or denying a certificate of appealability. Now that, I think, is a very important clue from Congress that Congress viewed the final judgment as the turning point.
That's when we're done in district court and we're moving the case along to the next stage, which is in the court of appeals.
I have a -- But the pre- -- the pre-AEDPA practice was to treat 59 and 60 differently.
So you would expect some clear indication, I think, from Congress if they were going to upend that long-standing practice in repeating the ""second or successive"" language. And you started your argument by saying there's no difference between 59 and 60. But there's the 28-day time period and there is the pre-AEDPA history, where the lower courts really did distinguish the two in this context. So how do you respond to that? Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I think that Congress did include text that clearly supplanted that, and it is the second or successive bar in Section 2244 which says that if you're filing a piece of paper that has habeas claims and it's -- How about an amended complaint then? Justice Kavanaugh, an amended complaint is not a second or successive habeas application because it comes prior to final judgment.
Our view is that the final judgment of the district court is the dividing line between prior or second. And that makes sense.
The Congress -- the text of the statute says you've got something that's prior and something that's second or successive.
There's got to be a dividing line between them somewhere. Well, why isn't the dividing line when the court has power over the case? The court still has power over the case at this point.
It doesn't lose it until the time to appeal runs.
Why isn't that the natural dividing line, this court still has this case? Because it -- a couple answers, Justice Kagan.
First, as I indicated earlier, Rule 11 is a clear signal that Congress views the final judgment as the turning point in the case out of the district court into the court of appeals. Second -- But it's the final -- -- it's a general rule of -- -- judgment that gets suspended at least for appeal purposes. The finality is suspended. That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg.
The final judgment in any civil case can be executed immediately.
It's immediately a basis for collateral estoppel, for claim preclusion, it can immediate -- Yes, but, for purposes of appeal, it isn't.
It -- it is suspended for that purpose. No, that's also not correct, Justice Ginsburg.
The deadline to appeal is suspended when a 59(e) is filed, but you can still file a notice of appeal immediately.
That's covered by FRAP 4(a)(4)(B). So the notion that there's any suspension of finality, I think, is a misnomer, and it's not the correct way to look at it. Rule 4 is simply saying that if you file a 59(e), the deadline to appeal is suspended, but, in all other respects, that judgment is still final, it's still the basis of all the things that I indicated earlier, and within the meaning of Rule 11, that's the turning point when we're done in district court and we're going on to the court of appeals. What do you do with the merger that -- that this is treated -- if the motion is denied, it merges into the final judgment? Well, Your Honor, I don't think that has any impact on my argument at all.
In ordinary civil litigation, the merger principle means that the court of appeals is getting one appeal based on the final judgment and the denial of the 59(e).
In this case, the 59(e) is not actually filed in district court if it's a second or successive application because it didn't comply with 2244's routing mechanism, by which it needs permission from the court of appeals. So the district court has no jurisdiction to entertain it, cannot act on it. It's not filed.
And at -- at that point, it -- it's effectively something the district court doesn't have jurisdiction over. So is your -- is it your -- is -- do I have this right or not? In your -- in your view, on day 42, after the original complaint was filed and they had a trial and hearing and so forth, judgment comes in.
The lawyer reads it.
Next day, he files a piece of paper. Your Honor, the judgment says X.
All the evidence was the other way.
You must have skipped those pages.
And if you go back to the state court, it was the opposite.
The judge looks at it and says: My God, he's right.
I would like to change this. And you're saying too bad, too bad, you can't change it.
The only thing to do is to go to the court of appeals on the first one, on the first judgment before he wants to change it and he can't, and we'll have the court of appeals change it. Is that what your view is? Not quite, Justice Breyer.
What -- my view is this: That piece of paper that Your Honor is talking about has to be routed through the court of appeals in order for the district court to entertain it. Yeah. But I'm not saying that AEDPA divests district courts of their inherent -- I didn't -- -- power sua sponte -- -- say that.
I just said that if I take your argument, then you see what the point of my example was, that this is a pretty good waste of time and that's why we have Rule 59, to prevent those wastes of time. That's my argument.
And that's what I want to hear you respond to, if that's okay. May I respond, Mr. Chief Justice? Sure. Well, Your Honor, as was indicated earlier, to the extent there's a policy judgment being made here, Congress has clearly determined that it wants these going to the court of appeals.
Congress was surely aware that there may be instances in which the district court could quickly and easily dispose of a second or successive application.
Whether it's a 60(b), a 59(e), a 2241, or anything else, Congress made that decision for us. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Snyder. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Breyer, I'd like to start with the -- the last question that you asked, and then I'd entertain any other questions. To the extent that what you're doing here is you're making a practical determination, I think it's relevant that while Petitioner says that this -- that his rule will allow courts to correct obvious errors, he has not identified a single case since AEDPA was enacted in which a district court has actually granted a Rule 59(e) motion in this posture.
And his amici say that this happens regularly but have identified just three cases in more than 20 years in which it's actually occurred. In one of those cases, the district court could have actually granted that motion under our rule.
And in the other two, the -- the court of appeals could have entertained exactly the same arguments. So you -- the benefits of his rule are largely hypothetical and quite minimal.
And on the other side of that ledger, you have Rule 59(e) motions being filed regularly in -- last year, it was 22,000 habeas and Section 2255 motions filed in the federal district courts. And so, even if it only takes a few days for a judge or -- to read through the 25-page motion and say, okay, I've thought about these before, I'm not persuaded by any of these arguments, over the entire course of those 22,000 cases, that burden is going to outweigh the -- Well -- -- the benefits -- -- 59(e) is not wildly successful in any context.
So your argument is really an argument against 59(e).
I mean, I don't know that there's statistics that say it's any less successful or -- or significantly less successful in this context. So, Your Honor, I think that the key distinction is that in the context of habeas, when you're talking largely about pro se litigants, you're dealing with people who don't have the same constraints in terms of the motions that they're willing to file as regular litigants.
A regular litigant has to pay a lawyer to file that motion.
And if so -- so if there's no chance that that motion is going to be granted, they just don't file it. In this context, though, the upshot of Petitioner's rule -- I don't know if that's true, but keep going. (Laughter.) So there may be some that are not meritorious, but they're going to be -- Lawyers sure have incentive to file them, don't they? They may, but lawyers also have responsibilities to their clients to move the case along to the court of appeals. And so, in our view, that's what Congress was doing here.
Congress looked at habeas litigation prior to the enactment of AEDPA and recognized that it was flooding the federal courts with repeat filings.
So the purpose of the second or successive bar was to prevent those repeat filings. But 59(e) motions had not been considered second or successive before. Justice Kavanaugh, I don't agree with that.
The only case prior to AEDPA that had asked whether a Rule 59(e) motion could qualify as a second or successive petition held that it could. Now my friend on the other side says that courts entertained Rule 59(e) motions, but, as Justice Alito pointed out, it made perfect sense in a pre-AEDPA world to say there's no jurisdictional bar with respect to second or successive petitions.
The standard that I'm going to apply is a malleable ends-of-justice standard.
I'm just going to cut to the chase and say, however you want to think about this motion, I'm denying it.
So -- But isn't that very different from what courts did with respect to Rule 60(b)? So Rule 60(b) provides a kind of comparator, and you can see the -- the -- the very divergent way that courts treated Rule 59 motions. So I -- there were far more Rule 60(b) motions in the pre-AEDPA period. And one key reason for that was that at the time AEDPA was enacted, you had to file a Rule 59(e) motion within 10 days.
So you had motions filed within 10 days and then all of the other motions. So it makes sense that you'd see a much broader array of 60(b) motions.
And those motions might be filed years and years after the case, where doing the analysis under 60(b) or the Rule 59(e) standard would require you to go back and completely immerse yourself in the case, and so it made sense to look to the standards that courts applied to abuse of the writ in second or successive petitions, whereas, for Rule 59(e) motions, you could just sort of cut to the chase, and that was perfectly appropriate. I think it's significant that what Congress did in AEDPA was change that.
Congress said we're no longer going to use this malleable ends-of-justice standard.
We're going to adopt a bar that says, unless you come within these narrow categories, they're just jurisdictionally prohibited. I -- I want to turn, if I could, though, to the text that Congress actually -- It wouldn't bar all 59(e) motions, right? It wouldn't bar all 59(e) motions. And -- and the argument on the other side is, therefore, the district court's going to have to make a threshold jurisdictional determination which could be complicated and mixed, there might be mixed questions there, and what's the point? So -- so, Your Honor, in -- in Gonzalez, this Court said that making that determination in most cases would be relatively simple.
That's at page 532 of the opinion.
And I think that's been borne out.
There are a couple of reasons for that. One is that this goes to the mixed petitions argument.
As the Court said in Gonzalez, the question is whether the filing or the submission contains one or more claims, so you don't have to go through the entire submission and figure out is this a claim, is that a claim? Once you find one claim, then you have an application and it has to go through the second or successive bar.
The other thing that I'd say about that is that my friend has suggested that perhaps Rule 59 motions that present or, excuse me, new claims would somehow be treated differently from other Rule 59 motions. So, once you make that concession, I think the idea that their rule is a perfectly clear rule sort of goes out the window because you're going to have to decide whether the arguments that you're making on the Rule 59(e) motion are so similar to the arguments that you made before that -- I think their main argument was that would not be a proper 59(e) motion, and would not be a successful -- I'm sorry -- 59(e) motion.
I think that was their main argument in response to that. I -- I think that's fair, Your Honor.
If I could, I'm happy to follow up more on that, but I wanted to -- to turn to the text.
And, Justice Ginsburg, your first question in the first half of the argument was when you look at this, doesn't this look a little bit like a second application because you had a prior one and then you had the second one filed that makes the same arguments. And what my friend on the other side said and what I think you will find every single time that he touches on this point in the brief is he says, no, it's not a second application because the prior proceeding has not finished. And with respect, that's just not what the statute says.
The statute in -- in Section 2250 or 2244(b) says that the way you draw this line is you look at whether there's a second or successive application by asking whether there was a prior application, not a prior proceeding. And so, here, there clearly was a prior application.
That application was denied. And then Mr. Banister submitted a second submission that was an application under the understanding that this Court had in Gonzalez. And I don't understand my friend to have really disputed that this comes within that standard of application.
So -- Well, why is -- I move for summary judgment, denied.
Now I can't make -- go ahead with the trial, make the same motion, win on the merits. I'm not -- So they're successive.
I'm just going the language.
I'm just saying it can't mean that. So -- so, if you move for summary judgment, I mean, or something equivalent in -- You don't have to deal with that seriously.
I'm just saying -- No, no, no, but -- -- there might be many examples in a trial where you repeat what you already said, and, therefore, the question is not answered in the statute. But -- Is it still part of the same case, or is it a new thing? Well, Your Honor, though, you're eliding -- again, respectfully, you're eliding again the distinction between -- it's not the same case.
It's whether it's part of the same proceeding or -- excuse me -- it's not the proceeding, it's whether it's part of the same application. So the motion for summary judgment says you should grant my complaint in this case, you should award me relief on my complaint, but it's still going to that complaint. Once the case is -- once that complaint has been adjudicated, once you have a final decision on the habeas application, Gonzalez says that a subsequent filing that says that that determination was wrong is also an application.
And I don't know how you can think of that as anything other than a second or successive application because you already have a prior -- I guess I don't know how, if you draw the line there, you deal with an amended application.
An amendment can be, you know, significantly different. That's true, Your Honor, and the statute expressly provides for that.
In Section 2242, Congress says that you can amend a habeas petition in accordance with the applicable civil rules. So that provides for amendments, and it makes clear that that amendment still goes to the same application.
There's no similar carveout for Rule 59(e). And, if I could, I want to make sure I get to the Section 2266 question that you asked about, Justice Kavanaugh, because I think it's related. In that section, Congress went through and laid out -- it looked very carefully at capital cases where it wanted to move the proceedings along, and it laid out deadlines for every one of the motions that it thought could be filed in every habeas case.
Just incredibly detailed there.
And it said nothing at all about Rule 59(e). Now my friend says that our argument is over-inclusive because it doesn't say -- because we acknowledge that you can file Rule 59(e) motions in some cases where they don't actually make habeas claims, but, just to be clear, our argument is more modest.
It's not that because Section 2266 doesn't mention Rule 59(e) motions, they're categorically prohibited. Our argument is that when Congress looked really carefully at this and tried to set out deadlines for how this system should work in the federal courts, it would have been really odd for Congress to leave out Rule 59(e) motions if, in fact, you could file in every single case a Rule 59(e) motion that asks the district court to readjudicate all of the arguments that it had already considered, because we know in that provision that Congress was trying to light a fire under the courts and make sure that those things are -- are decided. Congress would not have wanted to say you have to make the initial decision, the initial final decision on the habeas application within 450 days or 60 days from when it's submitted for judgment, but then you don't need to adjudicate -- you don't need to adjudicate that if there's a Rule 59(e) motion filed afterwards. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Three quick points.
First, I wanted to address the other side's test.
My friend from the United States was focusing on the test being -- whether there was a prior application filed, but, as Justice Kagan pointed out, that can't be the test because that would incorporate amended complaints as well, and everyone agrees that that would not count as a second habeas application. The fallback position that I think Texas has forcefully advocated is that it should be the time of judgment.
But that too is inconsistent with the structure of AEDPA because, in that, if you followed that logic, a petition for rehearing, which clearly is something that is in the appellate courts, which clearly is something that is filed after judgment, after the court of appeals has reached a determination, is asking them to say, hey, you got it wrong, we want you to revisit that, would not -- would also be a habeas application. Their answer to both of those points is that, well, AEDPA specifically contemplates amended complaints and specifically contemplates petition for rehearing, but I take that just as an acknowledgment that their test is inconsistent with the structure of the statute, and they're having to develop ad hoc exceptions in order to -- to read them in. Remember, under rule -- Habeas Rule 12, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a default apply in habeas proceedings.
You have to demonstrate an inconsistency with the statute.
So the fact that AEDPA doesn't specifically call them out and -- and recognize Rule 59(e) motions does not establish an inconsistency. The other point I wanted to make, I didn't hear a response from the other side to Justice Gorsuch's question about why their process is not going to be much more burdensome in practice.
A lot of the other side's arguments go to a theory that there should not be Rule 59(e) motions in habeas at all.
But, of course, that's not their position, and they can't get there as a matter of text. So it just is going to be the case that in every instance a district court is going to need to make this threshold inquiry about whether something is presenting a claim. Mr. Snyder said that that inquiry is going to be easy to determine.
Maybe in some cases it will.
But there certainly are going to be hard cases, and I think Fifth Circuit precedent alone bears that out. For example, the Fifth Circuit considers a motion that -- that argues to the district judge: Hey, you just missed this argument, you didn't rule on it at all, the Fifth Circuit considers that to be an attack on the integrity of the judicial proceeding, which is distinct in their view from arguing, district court, you got it wrong. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit takes the view that alleging a conflict of interest by habeas counsel would be attack on the integrity of the proceeding, even though this Court recognized in Gonzalez that merely arguing that appellate -- that habeas counsel missed an issue or failed to develop it would not be something that goes to the integrity of the proceeding. The point is not whether the Fifth Circuit is right or wrong about those classifications but that there are boundary cases and that it can be difficult.
And to require a Fifth -- a district court to make those threshold determinations and then potentially to have a court of appeals make a different determination about it is going to be much less efficient, is going to create real uncertainty about rules that are supposed to be clear and -- and -- and are linked to the time to appeal. The last point I'd like to make is with regard to Rule 4(a) and to Texas's argument about that.
Their argument, as I understand it, relies on examples that exclusively involve instances that are not seeking genuine Rule 59(e) relief and you need to look beyond the pleading to that -- to at least that extent. Well, that requirement comes right in the text of the rule itself.
It has to be a motion under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment.
If you title something Rule 59(e) and then you ask for attorneys' fees or you title it Rule 59(e) and say I want an extension, but you don't actually ask to alter or amend the judgment, it doesn't satisfy the plain text of the rule. But Texas has expressly conceded -- this is at page 44 of their brief -- that Mr. Banister did file a true Rule 59(e) motion. They just think it should be subject to Section 2244(b).
But, even if it is, that doesn't mean that the motion wasn't filed, that it was a true Rule 59(e) motion seeking that relief, and that is all that Rule 4(a) requires. If the Court has no further questions, we ask you to reverse. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-631, William Barr, Attorney General versus the American Association of Political Consultants. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to turn their cell phones off. Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1991, Congress enacted the TCPA's basic restriction on the placement of automated calls to cell phones.
In the years that followed, lower courts consistently upheld the constitutionality of that provision as a content-neutral restriction on the use of calling technologies that consumers found particularly intrusive and annoying. Congress's enactment of the government-debt exception in 2015 did not introduce any constitutional infirmity into the statutory scheme.
That exception is limited to a narrow category of calls that intrude less severely on consumer privacy than does the typical automated call and that serve an important countervailing interest in protecting the federal fisc. There's been a good deal of back and forth in the briefs about whether Respondents' challenge is properly viewed as one to the exception or to the general automated-call restriction.
And I think, in circumstances like this, there's not a right way and a wrong way, not a right or wrong challenge to bring. There's simply two conceptually distinct analytical -- analytical ways of challenging a law that includes a basic restriction subject to exceptions. Here, we think that both challenges could have been brought but that both would fail.
But I'd like to focus first on the challenge that Respondent is asserting in its brief.
These are the -- this is the challenge that Respondents are asking the Court to focus on. And that is the challenge to the underlying automated-call restriction.
And Respondents' basic theory is that the government-debt exception, taken in combination with other aspects of the statutory scheme, prevents the automated-call restriction from performing its intended consumer protection function, renders it insufficiently efficacious to be upheld under the First Amendment. And we think that's wrong.
If you look at the statute, the only other statutory exceptions to the automated-call restriction are those for emergency calls and calls with -- made with the prior express consent of the recipient. And Respondents have not contended that either of those is -- raises a First Amendment problem or casts doubt on the efficacy of the underlying restriction. Mr. Stewart, your -- So that -- -- your -- one of your basic points to avoid strict scrutiny under the First Amendment is that you're not really looking at the content of the communication in this case, but, rather, it's more properly viewed as part of an economic relationship. I don't see how that gets you out of the content category.
You still have to look carefully at what's being said before you can decide whether the phone call is covered by the provision or not.
I think that's the clear holding of our decision in the Reed case. Well, I think that as -- let me -- let me address Reed first and foremost.
At the outset of the Court's analysis in Reed, after the statement of the case, the Court described content-based laws as ""those that target speech based on its communicative content."" And if we're focusing now on the automated-call restriction, the provision of the statute that Respondents say is the focus of their constitutional challenge, it's impossible to say that that restriction targets Respondents' calls based on their communicative content. The -- the situation was very different in Reed.
In Reed, the town had 23 different categories of signs in its sign code, a multitude of different treatments of the different categories.
One of them was temporary directional signs, and that was the category of signs that the plaintiffs in the case wanted to put up.
And you could tell exclusively from the content of the sign what -- which category it fell into and -- and what restrictions applied. And in that circumstance, it was natural for the plaintiffs to argue and the Court to hold that they had been targeted based on the communicative -- communicative content of their signs. Here, Respondents haven't been targeted in any -- in any meaningful sense. Their political communications are subject to the same restrictions that apply to the vast, vast majority of automated calls. Counsel, I'd like -- The fact that they're here -- -- I'd like to jump ahead a little bit and get to the severance question.
You say that if this exception for government debt is found to be problematic, you should just sever that and keep the rest of the statute. But, when we sever provisions, it's because they are illegal.
Here, there's nothing illegal about the government-debt exception.
It just, when combined with the rest of the statute, makes the whole statute vulnerable. I wonder why in that situation the whole statute shouldn't fall? I guess the two things I would say are, first, it's important to look at the temporal sequence that produced the current state of affairs; that is, the basic restriction was enacted in 1991 and the government-debt exception was enacted in a separate public law in 2015.
And -- Okay.
I've got -- I've got that.
What's your second point? The second point is that the ultimate question of severability is one of congressional intent, what result would Congress have preferred.
And for purposes of determining what Congress would likely have preferred, it seems really like the tail wagging the dog to say that we will treat Congress's desire to free collectors of government-backed debts from these restrictions, whether -- as taking preeminence over Congress's desire to protect all consumers from all other automated calls. We think Congress -- Thank you -- -- would clearly have -- -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Stewart, it would seem a bit odd, as you suggest, that we sever the exception, but, here, it doesn't seem -- this remedy doesn't seem to give anything to Respondent.
It doesn't add any more speech for that for the Respondent.
And it seems to be taking speech actually away from someone who's not in this case. I mean, that -- that may be true, but the Court's task in determining the appropriate remedy is to kind of follow established principles of severability, to look to indicia of Congress's likely intent. And if the result is that the plaintiff at the end of the day doesn't get the practical result that it was looking for, that's not a reason to kind of re-jigger the constitution -- the severability analysis.
I mean, it -- it often is the case that a plaintiff can achieve a practical victory only on -- by prevailing on both of two legal questions. And sometimes it is a question both of the merits of the claim and of the appropriate remedy.
And if a court holds that, yes, you were right, you've established the existence of a violation, but the statute read properly simply doesn't authorize the remedy you seek, that that's one of the chances that the plaintiff takes when it pursues a claim that depends on prevailing on two separate legal propositions. The plaintiff persuaded the court as to one legal proposition, didn't persuade the court as to a second proposition that was really essential to getting the practical result it wanted -- that's not an unusual situation in the law. Well, I'd like to shift gears and -- and focus, just ask the question about your strict scrutiny analysis. You seem to focus on the interest that the individual has in privacy of the cell phone. But it would seem to me that that privacy interest is actually not nearly as great as you would -- as a person would have in the landline phone at home or in even someone knocking on their front door. Well, I think it -- it -- at the time that the statute was enacted, cell phones were obviously a lot less prevalent. They may have been used on -- on rare occasions, and -- and most people didn't own them. I think now cell phones are, as we explained in the reply brief, are ubiquitous. They are an integral part of daily life for most individuals.
And so, really, the privacy interest is -- is greater than in the residential landline. Yes, if the phone rings at your home and you happen to be there, it may be an intrusion.
But most people or virtually all people when they are at home will have their cell phones with them.
So unwanted calls to cell phones will still pose the same threat to residential privacy that unwanted calls to landlines would. But, in addition, people for the most part carry their cell phones with them at all times.
And so the effect of automated calls to cell phones is not just potentially to disturb residential privacy, it's potentially to disturb them when they're at work, when they're on social occasions, when for whatever reason they might want to be open to calls from friends or calls from family members but won't -- don't want to be distracted by -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg? Counsel, I don't see how you can escape a content-based distinction.
If the content is a debt owed to the government, that's the content of the message, you owe the government for a student loan or whatever, then the call is okay. But, if the message is, please contribute to our political organization, it's banned.
So it's based on what the message is. Pay the government what you owe the government, or contribute to our political organization. I think, as -- as we've said in our briefs, it -- it is true that often a court in determining whether the government-debt exception applied would look in part to the content of the call. But you wouldn't be looking exclusively to the content of the call.
For instance, determination whether the particular debt that was sought to be collected was, in fact, owed to or guaranteed by the federal government would have nothing to do with the call's content.
It would depend on the financial relationship between the debtor and the federal government. And it is characteristic in the legal culture that Congress would enact statutes that regulate communications made in particular fields of economic activity.
And so you have laws that regulate what can be said or what disclosures have to be made in connection with the sale of securities. And they're subject to First Amendment challenge.
Plaintiffs can argue that particular restrictions go too far.
But nobody thinks of laws like that as being especially suspect because they are limited to the field of securities, even though, to determine whether a particular communication was covered, a court would need to look in part at the content of the communication. Switching to the severance, we're told that if we strike only the government-debt exemption, that will leave the political groups with no incentive at all to assert their First Amendment claim.
They're going to lose at the end of the day. So why should they bother challenging -- why -- why should they bother with a First Amendment claim when it will be unsuccessful at the severance stage? Well, a couple of responses to that.
The first is, as -- as I was indicating earlier, that the plaintiffs here did argue and they were entitled to argue that the appropriate remedy, if there was a constitutional violation, was to strike down the whole restriction. But they didn't persuade the court of appeals on that question.
And if the application of ordinary severance principles would confirm that result, then the Court's duty is to follow those principles even though it leaves this plaintiff without a remedy. The other thing, as we discussed -- Counsel. Justice -- Justice Breyer? Well, what your last statement, and Justice Ginsburg leads me to ask a somewhat philosophical question, which you need not answer if you don't want to, but my question is, what is content discrimination? All human life is carried on through speech.
All government regulation is carried on through speech.
Every single statutes book is filled with all kinds of content discrimination. The SEC and every agency deals with nothing but what do their rules apply to, where are the exceptions, et cetera.
And so I'd always thought that that was in Justice Brandeis's third category, economic regulation, as far as the First Amendment is concerned, or at least most of it was. So how in your view do you distinguish between what is in that third category, look to see if it's reasonable, what is in the first category, never uphold it almost no matter what? How -- how? What's your way of doing it? I don't think we have any succinct test that would capture all cases, but I would point the Court or remind the Court of certain guideposts that it set up. One is, if you can tell exclusively from the content of a message whether a particular law applies, then that's very likely or almost certain to be content-based. The second is, as I was referring to earlier, the Court in Reed referred to content-based laws as those that target space -- speech based on its communicative content.
And, here, even if you thought that the government-debt exception was content-based, it wouldn't follow that the automated-call restriction is content-based. The automated-call restriction doesn't target speech because of its content, it treats the vast majority of speech the same, and it simply exempts from regulation a very small category of speech. And then the third thing I would say is, whatever the right answer is, it can't be that whenever speech -- the mere fact that a particular law is limited to speech that is used in a particular economic activity, that limitation cannot by itself be sufficient to render the law content-based or at least to subject it to strict -- strict scrutiny because that would -- that principle would cast doubt on a vast array of laws that Congress and state legislatures have enacted to regulate discrete spheres of economic activity. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Justice Alito? Mr. Stewart, the so-called severability issue in this case is really fascinating.
I understand you don't think we need to get to that, but assuming for the sake of argument that we do get to that question, what is your best precedent for the application of a severability analysis in a case like this, where, arguably, a regulation of speech is unconstitutional only because it contains a content-based or a viewpoint-based exception? I don't think either side has a precedent that was specifically in the First Amendment area, where the Court discussed whether severability principles should apply and, if so, how do they apply. I think our best precedents are cases like Morales-Santana and Ross.
Yes, those were equal protection cases, but they said, in deciding whether an exception should be severed or the underlying rule should be struck down, we look at things like the temporal sequence in which the laws were enacted, whether the exception was enacted later in the day, the degree of Congress's commitment to the basic rule, and I think those are good analogies here. Where the gravamen of the First Amendment claim is that this person's speech is being treated differently from another person's speech -- Well, what's your -- -- obviously, the -- -- what is your response to this counterargument? In an equal protection case, what the complaining party is objecting to is unequal treatment.
So, whether the -- the remedy levels up or levels down, the complaining party gets what it wants, namely, equal treatment, whereas, in a free speech case, what the complaining party is objecting to is a restriction on its speech. And if we apply the severability analysis in that situation, the complaining party does not get what it wants, which is the ability to speak without restriction. I think, with respect, that -- that conflates what the complaining party wants with what is it -- with what it is entitled to.
And, for instance, in Morales-Santana, there's no question that what the complaining party wanted was citizenship. It wanted to be able to invoke on be -- the plaintiff wanted to be able to invoke on behalf of his father the constitutional right to equal treatment for unwed fathers and unwed mothers.
And, yes, the gravamen of his claim is, I have a legal entitlement to equal treatment. But what, as a practical matter, the plaintiff wanted was citizenship, and he didn't get it as a result of the Court's severability holding.
The Court said, we apply established principles of severability in order to determine what we think Congress would have intended, and the consequence is that even though you have established a right -- a violation of the right to equal treatment, you are not entitled to the practical result that you are seeking. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, the -- the difficulty in my mind with this case has been just touched upon by Justice Alito. Assume that I do think -- or assume not that I think -- but assume that this law is content-based.
I don't see in the record any evidence by you of how small this exception is. The other side says that most of the complaints to the FTC are because of debt collection.
But there are no statistics about how big or small debt collection is with respect to robo- -- robot -- robo-calls generally or with respect to consumer collection. And even if you could show me that they were a small part of the intrusions on people, they certainly are a big emotional complaint because they generate the most ire by citizens.
But putting that aside, you haven't shown me why government-backed debt calls are any different than commercial calls, private commercial calls for debt. In both situations, the debtor would expect a call about debts they owe.
That's an interest that the government's claimed, but, you know, so what? Both debtors.
So there is a discrimination aspect to this case that does raise the equal protection ground. But putting all of that aside, given that the burden is on you under strict scrutiny to show that you've narrowly tailored a law, if this is content-based, and with all the failings I've pointed to, how do you win on validating this Act? Let me say two or three things about this.
First, I think it would be impossible to make an empirical showing about kind of the smallness of the exemption relative to the whole, because what you would want to compare the government debt calls to is not to other calls that are actually being made in the world, because a lot of the calls that would otherwise be made are not being made precisely because they're barred by the TCPA. What you would want to be asking is, how small is this comparison in comparison -- how small is this class in comparison to all of the other automated calls that might be made if the TCPA were not in force? Second, with respect to potential discrimination between collectors of government-backed debts and collectors of other debts, the distinction that we've pointed to is that the collection of government-backed debts implicates the distinct federal interest in protecting the federal fisc, and it's not unusual for Congress to prefer federal debt collection efforts. For example, if Congress says the federal government can collect debts owed to it by offset on a tax return -- a tax refund or Social Security benefits, the private predators can't do that, or if the federal government has greater capacity to garnish wages, that there's nothing problematic about that, that the last thing we would say is collectors of private debts could petition the FCC for an exception. They could say, there's no good reason to treat us differently and, therefore, you, the FCC, should exercise your statutory authority to create an exception for all debt collection calls as to which the recipient is not charged. And then the FCC would either grant or deny that.
If it was denied, there could be judicial review.
So there could be a more targeted challenge that was premised on the differentiation between government-backed debts and others, but that's very different from -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Good afternoon, Mr. Stewart.
Could we go back to the -- what you started with? You said that there was no right way to think about how to analyze this question, that we could either apply constitutional analysis to the automated-call restriction or we could apply it to the exemption for government debt. I'm wondering whether you could say a little bit more about that, because we have to pick some way, and on the one hand, the restriction is the only thing -- the automated-call restriction is the only thing prohibiting speech, but on the other hand, the exemption is the only thing that creates the constitutional issue in this case. So which end of the statute should we look at? Well, let me preface my answer by -- by pointing to a hypothetical that's noted in the Respondents' brief that we think is a good illustration of when it would be appropriate to focus on an exception. At page 22, Respondents hypothesize a statute that has a categorical ban on all automated calls except for automated calls to a residential landline that endorse the re-election of Donald Trump and that are approved by the Trump campaign. Now we think an exception like that for calls made to endorse a single political candidate would surely violate the First Amendment.
It would be not only content-based but viewpoint-based, and there would be no good justification for it in terms of the basic rationale for the restriction. And even if the Court concluded that this was a very small percentage of calls, the exception didn't cast doubt on the credibility of Congress's overall privacy protection objectives, even if it didn't sufficiently -- significantly interfere with the achievement of those objectives, the Court would surely say that the -- the exception was invalid. So is this statute -- And in that circumstance -- -- is this statute like that statute? I don't think it's like that statute.
I mean, the -- the last thing I'd want -- I mean, it's obviously not in the sense that it's not -- the -- the -- the exemption is not viewpoint-based to the extent that that statute is.
But, you know, some -- you've heard some arguments that the exemption is content-based, so why not treat it the same way? I mean, I think, at the very -- at the very most, you would treat the exemption in the same way that you would treat it if a restriction were imposed based on the same criteria.
And if there were certain restrictions placed on -- on the collection of government-backed debt and only on the collection of government-backed debt, you wouldn't apply strict scrutiny to such a law for the same reasons I've discussed with respect to the -- the securities laws, other hypothetical laws that could restrict communications in a particular area of commerce. Now Respondents have understandably focused their attention on the automated-call restriction, in -- in part because of the severability question.
If they could persuade the -- the Court that the exception was the invalid provision and it was struck down, they wouldn't really get what they want. But they have to establish distinct prerequisites to show that they have a valid constitutional challenge to the automated-call restriction.
One might be if the exception taken in combination were -- with other features of the statute just made it seem as though Congress wasn't serious about protecting privacy.
But the exception really can't -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Good morning, counsel.
Some of my colleagues have already noted the irony of a First Amendment challenge leading to the suppression of more speech as a remedy.
I -- I guess I wanted to explore that just a little bit further. As I understand it, you -- you've taken a position that there's no right way to do severance here, but should we -- should we take cognizance of the fact that striking down the government-debt provision was not relief that the plaintiffs sought in this case? And we normally take some cognizance of the adversarial process and the plaintiff's request for relief. We -- we've chided plaintiffs earlier in this term for not -- not including all the relief they might have wanted -- wanted in -- in their complaint. And what do we do about the fact as well that the plaintiffs would seemingly have no standing to challenge an exception for government debt collection activities? So they didn't seek the relief and they don't have standing for this relief.
Should -- should those things tell us anything? I mean, I think that you could do it that way and the court of appeals could have done it that way.
That is, the principal argument that the Respondents have made all along is that the government-debt exception, combined with other features of the statutory and regulatory scheme, really call into question Congress's commitment to the protection of privacy or prevent a statute from achieving that objective. And the court of appeals clearly didn't think that that was right.
And the court of appeals could -- could just have said: That's the only claim you made, I reject it, and whether or not you could have pursued a valid challenge to the exception itself, you haven't sought to pursue one, and, therefore, I'm not going to -- to consider it. I think our -- given that the court of appeals ruled as it did, we have tried to -- to confront that argument on the merits. With respect to the standing question, what the Respondents have always sought as relief invalidated of -- invalidation of the automated-call restriction.
And they clearly have standing to seek that. And if the Court holds that, yes, they're right to their First Amendment violation, but they are wrong about the remedy, that would not be a problem of standing.
That would just be a problem on the -- the merits of their claim or at least the merits of their claim with respect to the appropriate remedy. Let me come at it from yet another angle, and that's the separation of powers. The government's remedy proposed here is essentially that we should suppose or -- or reimagine that Congress would have preferred a regime in which more speech is suppressed than one in which less is suppressed. On -- on what authority do we have the right to make that kind of judgment as opposed to simply enforcing the First Amendment, finding a violation, and -- and -- and liberating the speech that's -- that's been wrongly suppressed? Let me say two or three different things about that.
The first are, either invalidation of the exception or invalidation of the restriction would produce a constitutional version of the TCPA.
So, from the standpoint of compliance with the First Amendment, neither is to be preferred. The second thing is, courts face that same question when you're doing severability analysis in the equal protection context, where the result of severance may be that particular -- If I might -- -- individuals might -- -- stop you -- if I might stop you there, I'm sorry, but I -- I -- the equal protection analogy, suppose that doesn't work for me because equal protection is -- is a guarantee of equality, not of a -- of a substance, so you can level up or level down and satisfy equal protection. But the First Amendment is about a guarantee of speech, so it has content in a different way.
So suppose that argument. Let me say that -- Then what do you have? -- let me say I think what we have is the temporal sequence here where we had one public law in 1991 that enacted the basic autodial restriction and then a second public law that was enacted in 2015.
And if you -- if there is a constitutional infirmity, if you ask which public law introduced that constitutional infirmity, it would have to be the 2015 public law. Thank you, counsel.
Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good afternoon, Mr. Stewart.
I think the government-debt exception is almost certainly content-based, at least for me.
And I just wanted as a matter of housekeeping, you don't argue that it could satisfy strict scrutiny, correct? That's correct.
We've argued that the automated-call restriction could satisfy -- Yes. -- strict scrutiny but not the content-based exception. Okay.
So those two things together make this for me at least a case about severability and leveling up or leveling down.
And you were just on this with Justice Gorsuch, but it would help me if you could kind of tick through your strong points about severability again. I think the -- the two strongest points -- and I'll link the second to Communications Act severability clause.
The -- the two strongest points are we think there would be a tail-wagging-the-dog quality to striking down the whole restriction, one that has been in place for nearly 30 years, that has been popular with consumers, that has protected a vast array of people, simply to preserve the ability of government debt collectors to use one more means of communication. The second is the temporal sequence. If we ask which law was it that introduced any constitutional invalidity, it would have to be the 2015 law, not the 1991 law.
And so it would be natural if you were otherwise in equipoise to say that's the law that would be struck down. And -- and then there -- So a key -- -- there is a severability -- Go ahead. I was going to say, there is a severability clause that says if any provision of the Communications Act, of which the TCPA is -- is a part, is held to be invalid, the remedy won't extend beyond striking down that provision. And for purposes of determining which is the invalid provision, I'd refer back to my point about temporal sequence.
It is the 2015 law that introduced any constitutional infirmity. So a key point I think you just underscored there is that the premise of your severability argument, a essential premise, is that the underlying ban is thoroughly constitutional. Or at least that the underlying ban was constitutional before 2015. Yeah, that's -- without the exception.
I meant to say without the exception, the underlying ban is perfectly constitutional. Yes. Okay.
And how much should we take into account on the what would Congress have intended analyses like we see in the states attorney general's brief about consumer beliefs about the -- these calls, that the common consumer complaint about robo-calls. Does that go at all into our analysis -- I mean, I think -- -- of what Congress would have intended? -- I -- I think certainly this was not unnoticed legislation. It's not legislation that fixed a technical problem.
I'm talking about the original TCPA now, that this is legislation that was intended to address a problem that Congress thought was immense, that affected vast numbers of consumers, and, obviously, the amicus briefs describe complaints that are being made now about robo-calls even with the TCPA's restrictions in place.
And so -- Thank you, counsel.
Would you take a minute to wrap up, Mr. Stewart? Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- the last thing I'd say is I'd refer back to the point that I was making at the beginning, where, given that Respondent is asking the Court to focus on the restriction and not the exception, it's appropriate to ask whether the restriction is content-based, as the Court in Reed understood that term. And the Court in Reed described content-based laws as laws that target speech based on its communicative content. Respondents' speech was not targeted based on its content.
It was treated the same way as the vast majority of messages that people could use automated calls to transmit. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My clients are political organizations that want to engage in political speech at the core of the First Amendment.
The TCPA bars them from using some of the most effective tools for communication now available: automated text messages and calls to cell phones. At the same time, the statute's exceptions let government-approved speakers use these same technologies to deliver government-approved messages that subvert the same privacy interests supposedly requiring a ban on all other calls. This content-based scheme arbitrarily favors commercial speech over core political speech.
It violates the First Amendment and should be struck down. The call ban is extremely broad. Although the TCPA's primary purpose was to address telemarketing calls, the cell phone ban sweeps further and outlaws political and other non-commercial calls, even when citizens are open to receiving them. The government says Congress needed a restriction that broad in order to protect privacy.
The statute's history disproves that. Congress and the FCC exempted non-commercial calls from the residential call ban after concluding that they do not adversely affect the privacy rights protected by the TCPA. There's no good privacy-based reason for treating these exact same calls differently when made to cell phones.
The government-debt exception confirms that Congress did not view the privacy interests here as compelling. That exception exposes 60 million Americans to unlimited calls to collect more than 4.2 trillion dollars in debt.
Those are the kinds of calls consumers hate the most. If Congress really thought privacy was paramount, it would not have allowed those calls.
Because the speech ban is too broad and unjustified, the restriction, not the exception, must be struck down.
That's what the Court has always done in First Amendment cases and rightly so. Federal courts cannot fix First Amendment violations by making more speech illegal.
This Court should reject the remedial approach that eliminates incentives to challenge unconstitutional speech bans and gives my clients no relief, even though they won their First Amendment claim. Mr. Martinez, I'd like you to focus on the argument based on our decision in Williams-Yulee, which is that when Congress takes steps that help cure a constitutional problem, they don't have to do everything at once. You object to the fact that some speech is allowed, but the -- the allowance doesn't reach more broadly.
And what we said in Williams-Yulee, again, is so long as Congress is moving in -- in what the Court regarded as the right direction, they don't have to do everything at the same time. So the fact that you say we should allow more speech here, here, and here, again, it doesn't mean that it has to be done at the same time as the first step was taken as it was here. Right, Your Honor.
And I think what -- what the Williams-Yulee inquiry is really getting at is whether the exception undermines the credibility of the government's interests that it's been asserting. And I think in this case, the 2015 exception really does undermine that because it's not getting at like -- it -- it's not trying to exempt the least intrusive of privacy speech available. It -- it's actually exempting the kind of speech that the FCC itself has acknowledged is the most intrusive kind of speech, and those are the -- the -- the debt calls.
And so Williams-Yulee, I think, is talking about a situation in which the government or Congress is trying -- or the legislature is trying to accommodate kind of the -- the -- this -- the -- the -- the speech that -- that is least problematic from the purpose -- from the standpoint of the interest that's being asserted.
But, here, Congress has done the opposite.
It's exempted the speech that's most problematic. And I think that that really makes this a different case from Williams-Yulee and brings us squarely within the -- the concern that Williams-Yulee had, which is that when Congress enacts broad exemptions, like the one here, it might actually be a sign, it might be evidence of the fact that the -- the interest that the government has asserted for speech restriction really isn't that strong. Your -- And I think that was debate -- -- your -- your friend on the other side on the severance question makes a very strong point, that Congress had this law for 25 years and then they added this, you know, pretty discrete exception that created the problem we have today. It seems pretty obvious that the way they would solve it is get rid of this exception.
It's an extremely popular law. Nobody wants to get robo-calls on their cell phone. The idea that Congress would embrace that result simply to save this government debt collection, they'd have to be very anxious to be more unpopular than they otherwise would be. Well -- well, two -- two points on that, Your Honor.
First of all, I think that the fundamental problem here is the invalidity of the restriction.
And I think that the -- even before you get to any severability inquiry about intent, we have to be very careful and specific about what is unconstitutional about the statute. And I think what the 2015 exemption shows, as well as the -- the much more favorable treatment to political and non-commercial speech when it comes to calls to home phones, what those show is that the privacy interest here really isn't compelling and that the -- the restriction is what falls.
So you don't even need to look at severability. Thank you -- But even as to the intent -- -- counsel. Justice Thomas? Thank you, Mr. Martinez.
The -- the problem that I have is you -- you just said that the -- the issue, that the real problem here is the restriction.
But the evidence -- the focus here is on the exception, the restrict -- if you solve the exception problem, it doesn't solve your restriction problem, particularly if you sever that. And that's the -- sort of the asymmetry that's coming out.
The problem is one thing, that is, that the restriction, but the constitutional problem is really the exception. But then the -- so why don't you -- I'd like you to explain why -- what you just said, why the restriction is the constitutional problem as opposed to the exception. Right.
And let me start with the -- with -- with the two things that I think the exception does.
Number one is it in -- introduces a content-based distinction. Yes. And it defines the scope of the restriction and therefore triggers strict scrutiny. But, number two, and more importantly for purposes of our constitutional theory, what the exception does is it reveals the underlying frailty, the underlying insufficiency of the justification for the restriction. And why does it do that? It does it because you have Congress saying because we want to get more money, we are willing to trade off privacy for revenue.
And so Congress is coming in and making a judgment that money is more important than privacy. So what -- And I think -- -- would your argument be if the exception did not exist? If the exception did not exist and we were looking at the law today, I think -- I think our argument would be weaker, but I think we would still be able to show that the restriction would be unjustified. And I think the -- But what would the -- -- main thing we would -- -- content-based -- I mean, what would the analysis be? The -- the analysis, it would -- the statute would no longer be content-based, so we'd be applying intermediate scrutiny, but I think in the context of applying intermediate scrutiny, we would look at the fact that calls to residential phones, where -- you know, call -- calls to the home, where privacy matters the most, these same types of political and non-commercial calls that my client wants to make are perfectly allowed. And so Congress and the FCC have made a judgment -- and this is clear if you look at the -- the 1992 order from the FCC.
Congress and the FCC have made a judgment that non-commercial and non-telemarketing calls do not adversely affect the privacy rights that the TCPA protects.
And they made that clear by -- by essentially allowing those calls at -- you know, at all times of day to home phones. And so, if -- if you have that indicator of congressional intent that they're not really worried about political calls and non-commercial calls and they're not worried about that as an intrusion of privacy, then there's no rational reason to treat cell phones differently.
And Congress certainly didn't make that judgment. Of course, in this case, we have not only the differential treatment of residential calls, but we also have the evidence provided by the 2015 exception, which shows that they're willing to trade off privacy for money, even though everyone would agree that money is not -- collecting more money is not a compelling interest.
And so you have Congress -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg? Your challenge is predicated on the government-debt exemption.
I thought that the statute as originally enacted would -- the -- the statute as it was originally enacted did have an exception for calls made by the government itself or government agencies. Isn't that true? It's true that the definition of -- of person, or at least as interpreted by the FCC, is that the -- the statute does not apply to -- to the government itself. And -- and no one challenged that exemption for 20-odd years.
One characterization is that this is really a manner of restriction.
That is, it doesn't prohibit calling, it doesn't prohibit conveying a message; it just prohibits using a certain automated technology to call.
So it's a manner of communication.
It's not a -- a restriction on the message. Well -- well, Your -- Your Honor, with respect, I do think it's -- it's fair to say that this is a restriction on a certain manner of making calls, but the types of calls that are either made legal or illegal -- you know, the dividing line between what's allowed and what's not allowed turns on the content of the calls. I think that if -- if -- if you were facing a statute that said, you know, for example, you are not allowed to advocate for Libertarians using email or using phone calls or using handbills, all of those would be manner restrictions, but I think that -- that we would all recognize that those are content-based restrictions that would trigger strict scrutiny and -- and would inevitably fail. On your severability, we know that what Congress wanted to stop were out-of-the-blue calls, calls that you had no reason to anticipate.
And calls about debts owed to the government can be regarded as less invasive in that respect, that they're not out of the blue; they are simply a reminder of an obligation that the debtor undertook. I -- Your Honor, I -- with respect, I don't think that that's the original justification for -- for this particular provision.
And I -- and I would point to two things. First of all is the fact that the kind of out-of-the-blue calls that my clients might want to make, you know, political calls, those are calls that were perfectly allowed and were perfectly acceptable to the home when Congress and the FCC acted in the early '90s. And at that time, of course, home phones were -- you know, over 90 percent of the phones in America were home phones.
That's where the privacy interests were at their apex. And nonetheless, Congress and the FCC recognized that the kinds of calls my clients want to make don't tread on privacy interests enough to -- to -- to -- to warrant that kind of -- of -- of restriction.
And I think what that just shows is that, again, the privacy interest being asserted here isn't really strong enough, even if you go look at what the FCC said about this, and I would look at the 1992 NPRM, especially at -- at pages -- at pages 8773 -- sorry, at page 2737, and then the 1992 order at 8773, because, there, the FCC said that non-commercial, non-telemarketing calls can be exempted without undermining the TCPA. If that's true -- Thank you -- -- then there's no reason -- -- counsel. Justice -- Justice Breyer? Justice Breyer? (No response.) Justice Alito? Mr. Martinez, I'm interested in your analysis of the severability question, and I wonder if you could say whether your position depends on either the breadth of an exception or exceptions or the manifestation of congressional intent. So let me give you an example, a fanciful example that tries to reduce both of those things perhaps to their lowest limit. Suppose there was a total ban on automated calls to cell phones or to all phones, but there was one tiny exception for, let's say, calls between noon and 1 p.m. on the 4th of July that contained this simple message: Happy Birthday, America. And let's say that the statute allowing this contains a provision that says that if the inclusion of this exception renders the statute unconstitutional, the statute itself shall remain in force and the exception shall be stricken. So would you say even in that situation the whole statute would have to fall? Your Honor, let me -- let me try to address that in each of the two pieces because I think it's a -- it's a nuanced question and deserves a nuanced answer. First of all, with respect to the narrowness of that particular ban, I think that the fact that that particular restriction or exception is so narrow, I think that probably, you know, looking at the totality of the circumstances, we would look at that and we would think the existence of this one tiny exception and the fact that this really isn't going to invade privacy that much, I think that would probably be a reason to conclude that the restriction is not unconstitutional.
And if that's true, then, of course, the severability analysis wouldn't be necessary. If you take your -- the other part of your hypothetical, though, if -- if -- as I understand it, if the statute had a provision in it that essentially said if -- if the restriction fails, you should nonetheless sever the exception and reinstate the restriction, I don't think that that would be appropriate because I think that the reason that the restriction would fail in that circumstance is that it's insufficiently justified, and getting rid of that exception doesn't solve that problem. The exception, you know, again, assuming that the exception was big enough to actually create a problem of constitutional deficiency with the statute, the exception is evidence of why the restriction is unjustified. And so getting rid -- rid of that doesn't solve the problem with the -- with the restriction. That does seem to thwart a pretty clear manifestation of congressional intent, but you think that's irrelevant in this situation? Well, I think in a circumstance, Your Honor, I don't think this is -- I don't think the government disagrees with us on this.
If you look at pages 17 to 18 of their reply brief, they essentially agree that if the problem with the statute is the restriction, then -- then the restriction has to fall. Now I think there's another way to look at the case, and -- and, you know, I think my -- my friend on the other side has sort of tried to frame it this way. If you thought that the only problem with the statute was not the justification for the restriction but, rather, the fact that there's differential treatment, we think that you still as a First Amendment matter for a number of the reasons already mentioned, that you would still need to get rid of the restriction. But, even if you didn't agree with us on that, I think there's -- our fallback position would be the position the Third Circuit took in the Rappa case, which is that you'd need very specific evidence of congressional intent. And I guess in that case, in your hypothetical, if your hypothetical expressly addressed this situation, then maybe in that case the -- the exception would be severed. But, again, that -- that is not the case here because, here, the underlying restriction is what's unconstitutional. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Mr. Martinez, are you taking the position that all restrictions of robo-calls are unconstitutional or that just a broad -- a broad restriction like this one is unconstitutional? Because there's some types of speech that should not be covered. Well, I think, Your Honor, in this case, obviously, we're dealing with -- with the statute at hand.
I think that -- that there are some restrictions on robo-calls that I think -- that probably would satisfy the -- the -- the appropriate level of scrutiny. And just to take one example, the -- the way that the -- the ban on calls works in -- to home phones right now, it's essentially a -- a ban on commercial telemarketing call -- robo-calls to the home.
And that's the kind of -- that -- that is the heart of what the TCPA was getting at. And that's what Congress and the FCC said, you know, this is really the core privacy that we're trying to protect.
I think that -- Well -- -- kind of statute is much -- -- Mr. Martinez -- and I agree with you.
And I -- I can think of others, if any -- any schemes to get money, any -- because there's so many scams from robo-calls, but putting all of that aside, assuming that there is a part of the restriction that could survive strict scrutiny under your claim, why shouldn't we limit any remedy striking down this provision simply to permit the types of calls that your clients make? Well, Your Honor -- Why should we be -- -- your -- -- why should we be striking down the entire statute? Now you would have to prove -- and I don't know that the Court has done this below -- that restricting political speech is not -- is -- is -- is not narrowly tailored, and I don't know that that's been done in this case, but, if the issue is the remedy, shouldn't we let the circuit below decide that question? Your Honor, two points on that.
First of all, we -- we brought this as a facial challenge.
We, of course, would welcome the kind of relief that you -- you've hypothesized, although we do -- we do think that the appropriate relief here really is to strike down the restriction in its entirety. And one of the reasons for that is the point that you raised with Mr. Stewart earlier, which is the -- the entire absence of any evidence or justification for this particular ban for -- for any of it, all of it or -- or pieces of it, that the government has completely failed to put forward. I mean, this -- this statute is subject to strict scrutiny, and this Court has said over and over again that the government is the one that bears the burden of satisfying strict scrutiny. They address strict scrutiny in, I think, a single sentence of the -- with respect to the exception -- restriction, a single sentence in their opening brief, a single substantive sentence in their reply brief, and nothing else.
They're trying to turn strict scrutiny into a rubber stamp. And I think the best thing to do in these circumstances is hold the government to its burden of proof, invalidate the restriction, and then Congress can come back and act and legislate in a -- in a way that's rational in light of the Court's decision. Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer? Yeah, thank you.
I'm sorry.
The telephone started to ring, and it cut me off the call.
And I don't think it was a robo-call. (Laughter.) And we got it straightened out. Okay.
My question is this: Forget the political part of this.
Assume it's out of it.
So now what worries me is, if you call this strict -- calling for strict scrutiny, I guess the government's justification, which is that government debt is owed to us all as taxpayers, private debt is not, so treat it specially. Well, there are many situations, food and drug agencies, agricultural agencies, governing selling, the FTC, the SEC, where they will have regulations and the regulations will have a broad category, and Item X falls within it, lamps may fall within categories that require you to put electricity regulation on how many amps does it use or whatever. But then you discover a sub-category of the one you just put in and you say leave out the sub-category for some reason.
Now, if courts start criticizing that for strict scrutiny, well, very few will survive. But the normal way of looking at it is, is it a reasonable thing, Justice Brandeis's third category.
Very well.
Why does this case fall into strict scrutiny once I get the politics out but not Justice Brandeis's regulation? Your Honor, a couple points on that.
I think this case falls into strict scrutiny because it satisfies the test for what constitutes a content-based restriction that was set forth in Reed, and as I note, Your Honor will remember -- You realize that what I'm doing is I -- I dissented and I'm wondering whether to stick to that approach or not.
So Reed will not convince me, it's a good a majority but I didn't think good enough.
Okay? Well, I would -- I would hope that stare decisis would be a factor even if you disagreed with me. Yes.
Okay, okay. But that isn't what I'm trying to get at.
I'm trying to clarify my own thinking on it. Fair enough, Your Honor.
Well, I think -- I don't think you should be concerned about the -- the -- the prospect of other laws that are economic regulations sort of being impacted by this at all because I think in the -- Yes, that's what I want the answer to, exactly why. Right.
In those cases, those kinds of -- of restrictions that -- that sort of get tangled up with speech in the context of those kind of regulations, those would be, at most, commercial regulations of speech, which wouldn't be subject to strict scrutiny, regardless of whether or not they're -- they're considered content-based. So, for example, the government lists a number of statutes in its brief that it says, you know, the sky's going to fall and all those statutes are going to be unconstitutional if we win.
That's just simply not true.
At most, those statutes are -- are -- would be regulations of commercial speech at most and, if so, they would try -- trigger intermediate scrutiny under this Court's settled doctrine. And isn't -- Justice Kagan? Thanks. Justice Kagan? Good afternoon, Mr. Martinez. Good afternoon. I'll give you a hypothetical.
Suppose this statute was written in a slightly different way and it exempted any calls between the holder of a government debt and the debtor.
Would strict scrutiny apply? Your Honor, I think that in -- in that circumstance, the -- the -- the -- the regulation would not turn on the content of the calls, and so I don't think strict scrutiny would apply for that reason. Right.
In other words, it would turn on the relationship.
And so I guess the question is, what -- what's the difference? I mean, that's what Congress was trying to get at, and maybe they didn't know all our arcane First Amendment rules, but that regulation basically covers a particular kind of economic activity, the collection of government debts, and this regulation covers the same kind of economic activity, the collection of government debts. There are two ways of getting at the same thing.
Both are directed at the economic activity of the people involved.
Why should there be any difference? Well, with respect, and perhaps I misunderstood the hypothetical, Justice Kagan, but I thought in your hypothetical that the -- as long as the relationship element was satisfied, the call could be on any subject whatsoever.
For -- so, in other words -- Oh, yeah.
Well, we know that holders of government debt call debtors, you know, to collect debts.
That's what they call them for.
They're not calling them to discuss political issues. Well, with respect, Justice Kagan, I'm -- I'm not sure that's right, and the FCC has expressly addressed this situation in their August 2016 order at page 9087, where the FCC has contemplated -- it -- it's discussing and addressing the content of the calls at issue being made by -- by collectors of government-backed debt, and it contemplates that -- that the subject matter of the call might range beyond the collection of government-backed debt.
Maybe they're going to be marketing some other product.
Maybe they're going to be saying, hey, call your Congressman and change these laws that apply to banks. And what the FCC has said is that when the subject matter of the call ranges to such topics, then the call is transformed and it's -- it's a call that would have been allowed and it's no longer allowed.
And so I think that -- I think that the chronicling of the call -- Well, I guess a technical issue -- -- is different here. Excuse me.
I guess a technical issue, Mr. Martinez, but I guess what I'm saying is that there are two ways where Congress is trying to get at the same thing, which is the calls between debt holders and debtors almost always about the debt. But, you know, why should we care? You know, even if Congress didn't write this in exactly the right way, why is it that we should care so much as to put strict scrutiny into place? This doesn't raise any real concerns about government censorship, about the suppression of ideas, about a distorted marketplace of ideas.
What -- why is this an appropriate time to put strict scrutiny into place, given that what the government -- what the -- what the legislation is trying to get at is an economic relationship and the things that flow from that relationship? Your Honor, I think that the -- that the robust test for content-based speech restrictions this Court adopted in Reed is important because it protects liberty.
It makes it harder for Congress to enact broad speech bans that affect everyone while at the same time assuming it can then just carve out special exemptions for favored groups. And I think the way to police that problem is by -- by making sure that Congress has to be very careful before it enacts the broadband and make it clear to them that they can't just do that and then, for example, as in this case, delegate authority to a government agency to hand out specialized exceptions for whatever well-heeled party turns up and claims an exemption. And so I think that that is one of the -- Thank you, counsel. Justice -- Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I'd like to just turn back to the -- the intuitive appeal of the government's severability argument. If, as I think you've -- you've conceded, that the -- the statute before the government-debt exception would not have been content-based and might have been permissible under the First Amendment, Congress then comes in and adds the government-debt exception, and that changes the equation. The intuitive argument based on that sequence of events is, well, just get rid of the government-debt exception and we go back to the status quo ante where everything was fine. Why -- why should we reject that intuition? I think there's -- there's a philosophical reason and a historical reason.
The philosophical reason is essentially that in the First Amendment context, courts should not be making more speech illegal because, if -- if courts take a certain type of speech that Congress expressly chose to -- to allow, and then courts make the decision to -- to prohibit that speech, they're essentially stepping into the legislature's shoes and making very sensitive policy tradeoffs that -- that indisputably cut against First Amendment interests, and they shouldn't be the ones to do that.
Philosophically as well, you need to make sure that people have incentives to challenge unconstitutional laws. I think, as a historical matter, though, it's -- I think it's important to recognize that the original justification for the ban on cell phone calls here was essentially that those kind of calls to cell phones would inflict charges on called parties.
And that's the reason that the ban was in place, you know, originally and -- and that's -- that's why it may have been justified earlier. But, in today's world, those call plans essentially don't exist or -- or are -- overwhelmingly people are not charged when they receive calls to their cell phone.
And so the -- the historical facts are different now.
And because of the fact that everyone has cell phones, the government has an especially strong interest now, from a revenue perspective, of making those debt calls. If you take all that and wrap it up together, I don't think there's a good historical basis or empirical basis for concluding that, in fact, we know with certainty or the kind of certainty we should have in the First Amendment context that Congress would have wanted to -- to -- to re-enact this statute if it wasn't allowed to make the calls to collect government-backed debts. Let me see if I -- if I've got at least that second point, my hands around it.
The argument is that maybe the first Congress that enacted the original statute thought that all -- all robo-calls should be prohibited, with some exceptions that you're not -- you have no complaint with. The second Congress, acting in a different time, had a different judgment about which calls should be permitted, and that included this government-debt exception.
And we don't know whether the second Congress enacting the revised statute would prefer a situation in which all calls are prohibited or all calls are allowed.
Does that -- does that sum it up? I think that sums it up, with one small caveat, which is that we are talking now on the assumption that this -- there -- that there is a severability analysis that's required here that turns on intent. I do think our -- our primary position is that the nature of the First Amendment and the nature of the constitutional flaw in this statute, which is the -- the flaw with the restriction, we think that that means that essentially, under -- under everyone's understanding of -- of severability principles, the restriction must be struck down. Thank you, counsel. And then -- I'm sorry, Justice Gorsuch? No, I'm fine.
Thank you, Chief. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good afternoon, Mr. Martinez.
On severability -- Good afternoon. -- we have no precedent either way on severability, as I understand it, when the First Amendment problem is created by an exception to a ban on speech, rather than the First Amendment problem being created by the underlying ban without the exception.
So I don't think we have any precedent either way. And the question, as you've pointed out and Mr. Stewart's pointed out, is level up or level down as the remedy. The key first question -- and I asked Mr. Stewart about this; I want to make sure I have you on this -- is the underlying restriction here, the underlying restriction on cell phone robo-calls, constitutional without the government-debt exception? So I want you to focus exactly on that question. Yes.
We -- we think that -- that given all the evidence we know now about what Congress's interests are and how strongly they believe or don't believe in the privacy interests, we believe that the restriction is unconstitutional. And I think the two prime -- Let me just -- let me make sure I have you exactly right.
The underlying restriction, if there had never been a government-debt exception -- let me phrase it that way.
If there had never been a government-debt exception, is the underlying restriction unconstitutional? We would say yes based primarily on the differential treatment of the residential call bans.
But I just want to say one thing on that, Justice Kavanaugh, because if you -- you want me to hypothesize that -- that the -- that the 2015 law had never been passed. Correct. I think that the 2015 law, if you think about that law as evidence -- as evidence of what Congress thought about privacy, the fact that it wasn't passed doesn't mean that deep down Congress believed in privacy more than we later -- you know, than was later revealed. And so I think it's important to recognize that, in our argument, the role of the 2015 exception is not merely to introduce the textual content-based distinction, but it's also to reveal the underlying lack of justification, which was always there.
And, again -- Well, I'm not -- I guess on that point I would pick up on what the Chief Justice said and -- and the states' amicus brief.
And if you just take a peek, just a peek, at the real world here, this is one of the more popular laws on the books because people don't like cell phone robo-calls. That seems just common sense.
Do you want to argue against that common sense? I think aspects of the law are popular.
I think, you know, the head of the FCC has called this law the -- ""the poster child for lawsuit abuse."" And the reason for that is -- and this is indirectly implicated in this case -- there's a whole bunch of other problems with the law as well. And so I think this law has its supporters and its detractors, but I don't think you should worry about Congress's ability to protect people.
Even if we win this case, Congress is going to have plenty of options that are fully constitutional in order to protect people from -- from unwanted calls. It can focus on the telemarketing calls.
It can focus -- it can expand the remedies available under the Do Not Call list, which essentially allow consumers to -- Well, even if -- -- to opt -- -- even if you -- -- out. -- even -- sorry. Even if you lose this case, Congress can, of course, scale back when you view as overbroad restrictions, but if you lose this case, Congress will still have in place a restriction that's been on the books for 30 years and that has been perceived as constitutional and that is very popular. Well -- well, I -- I -- I -- I -- I guess what I would say is that I think the right way to think about this is to apply the doctrinal tools that you always apply in First Amendment cases, even in cases where the speech involved is not popular. I mean, the First Amendment is there not just to protect speech that people like but to protect speech -- Yeah. -- that people might find offensive or -- or annoying.
And -- and -- Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Martinez, would you like to take a minute to wrap up? Thank you, Your Honor. The -- the core purpose of the First Amendment is to protect the free exchange of political speech, even when people might find that speech to be a nuisance.
That's what this Court recognized in the Martin case when it said that First Amendment rights protect people from -- from making intrusive door-to-door solicitations.
That's protected activity.
The calls at issue here are protected activity as well. We ask you to do what you always do in First Amendment cases, strike down the unconstitutional restriction on speech.
Thank you, Your Honors. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have rebuttal? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I took Mr. Martinez to acknowledge that if -- if this were a restriction on speech undertaken to collect a government-backed debt, it would be subject at most to intermediate scrutiny because it would be commercial speech and would be subject to distinct First Amendment treatment on that basis. And the -- the position of the other side is this provision should be reviewed more skeptically, should be subject to more certiorari review because its effect is to take particular speech out from under regulation rather than to regulate it. And that's contrary to the -- the usual understanding that the First Amendment exists to foster speech.
It's contrary to the Court's reference in Reed to laws that target speech because of its communicative content. Why would the Court review more skeptically the law that looked at the same basis as a rationale for exempting speech rather than to regulate? The second thing is Mr. Martinez said many times that Congress and the FCC have exempted non-commercial calls from the automated-call restriction.
And I think that really overlooks the respective responsibilities of Congress and the FCC. Congress has broadly regulated at least calls using a pre-recorded voice or an artificial voice to residential landlines just as it has calls to cell phones.
Both of the underlying bans encompass non-commercial calls. Congress has vested the FCC with broad, though not identical, authority to exempt particular categories of calls from the residential and the cell phone ban respectively, and you can look at page 5A and 6A of the appendix to the government's merits brief to see that the -- the exemption authority is -- is basically comparable. The discrepancy under current law results from the fact that the FCC has exercised its exemption authority much more robustly with respect to residential landlines than it has with respect to cell phones.
That can't create a facial constitutional infirmity in the statute itself.
If people think that the FCC should adopt comparable exemptions for non-commercial calls to cell phones, they can file a petition to that effect. The -- the last thing I'd say in respect is -- goes to the colloquy between Mr. Martinez and Justice Kagan, where Mr. Martinez said, yes, if they had framed it not in terms of the content of the call but in terms of all calls from the holder of a government-backed debt to -- to the debtor that that would be subject to more relaxed scrutiny.
And that would simply be -- an approach that distinguished on that basis would simply encourage Congress to enact laws with more of a broad brush. It would discourage Congress from trying to fine-tune laws, and that discouragement would only be exacerbated if we took the Respondents' approach to severability striking down the whole law. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-725, Barton versus Barr. Mr. Unikowsky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question before the Court today is, what does it mean for an offense to render an alien inadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule? The Court should hold that an offense renders an alien inadmissible if the immigration judge finds that the offense renders the alien inadmissible at the removal hearing that precipitates the need to apply the stop-time rule. If the Court disagrees with that and agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that inadmissible is a status, it should hold that an alien acquires that status when the alien is capable of being charged with inadmissibility. In this case, neither condition is satisfied.
Petitioner was not found inadmissible.
He wasn't capable of being found inadmissible.
Therefore, he was not rendered inadmissible. So I'd like to begin this morning with a concession the government makes at pages 29 and 30 of its brief which I think narrows the issues in this case somewhat.
So the government concedes that when the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable,"" which are the crucial words in the stop-time rule, when those words are used in a statute that has a connection to the alien's own removal proceeding, they're a reference to the charge against the alien at that proceeding. They're not a status. So the government agrees that in those contexts, its proposed interpretation of the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule is incorrect.
So, in Section 1226, the mandatory detention statute, that says that an alien who is inadmissible by reason of having committed an offense under Section 1182 is subject to mandatory detention, the government agrees there that ""inadmissible"" is a reference to inadmissible at the proceeding, not just the status of being inadmissible. The government says that's natural in that context, and we agree, because that's a statute with the relationship to the alien's removal. Same thing in Section 1252.
That's the jurisdiction-stripping statute.
That says that courts of appeals don't have jurisdiction to hear petitions for review by an alien who is removable for certain specified reasons.
There, too, the government agrees removable is not the status; it's a reference to the actual charge at the hearing, and they say that's natural in that context because the statute has a connection to the alien's removal proceeding. So the question in this case boils down to whether the government has put forward a sufficient case for holding that the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule mean something different from what it concedes they mean in these adjacent or nearby statutes addressing the same subject matter. And I don't think the government has put forward that case, because I think that many of the contextual clues that apply in the nearby statutes also apply in the stop-time rule, or at least there isn't a sufficient reason for construing those statutes differently. So, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the stop-time rule is applied only in the context of removal proceedings after the immigration judge has just decided whether an alien is inadmissible or removable.
So there's like two steps. At step one, the immigration judge decides whether an offense renders the alien inadmissible or removable.
And then the immigration judge decides eligibility for cancellation. That's not quite true, though.
Some aliens concede removability and are seeking cancellation. Yes, that's correct. And then there are some that are ordered -- who are found inadmissible or removable not on the basis of a crime at all. So that's true, but in -- So you have two classes of people that aren't covered by the way you're reading admissibility now. No, but there's still a threshold finding of inadmissibility or removability.
It's true there might not be a hearing; there might be a concession.
But, in the most typical cases, it's based on an offense, and in every case, there's just been a holding, an adjudication, that for some reason the alien is inadmissible or removable. But -- Mr. Unikowsky, could I -- could -- could I possibly get an argument off the table? Do you really want to argue that the concept of inadmissibility is not a status? I think that the word varies depending on the context in which it's being used.
So I can't -- Okay.
Well, that's a different question in -- but is -- is or is not the concept of inadmissibility a status? I think that it can -- the word can mean two things.
I mean, I agree with you that the DLE sounds like a status at least in some contexts.
I can't -- I'm not conceding -- I'm not going to argue something that's obviously wrong. There are certain contexts in which the way using that word it sounds like a status. So I agree, if you go to your lawyer before the hearing and say, hey, I want to go to Niagara Falls, am I inadmissible, in that context, it's talking about a status.
That's clear. But I also think it's clear that in certain contexts when you're talking about the removal proceeding itself -- Give me a -- give me an example in ordinary speech where inadmissibility is not a status.
You just gave the example of -- you just gave an example yourself where it would be. Yeah. Somebody is in Europe and is going to buy a ticket to come to the United States.
If that person does not satisfy -- that person is inadmissible, that person is inadmissible at the time when the ticket is purchased -- So I -- -- or at the time when the person gets on a bus in Central America to come to the southern border, or if evidence is inadmissible, it's inadmissible before the attorney tries to admit it at trial, right? That -- so that's true, but it seems to me that when you're using the word in the context of talking about the removal proceeding itself, what you really mean is inadmissible at that proceeding.
So, again, I think 1226 is a perfect example of this. Okay.
So -- Yeah. -- that -- that's the -- what I want to get off the table.
So it is a status when -- you may or may not agree with me, I gather that you don't.
But, if I think it is a status, then the question is whether -- is the context in which this status can be assessed, right? Yeah, I mean, I'm comfortable calling it a status if we define the relevant status as status of inadmissible at that proceeding, as opposed to status of theoretically -- Okay.
Then you have to show why, in the context of a -- a removal proceeding for an LPR who has not left the country, there cannot be a -- an assessment of inadmissibility of the status.
You have to show why that is so. So I think it's for many of the same reasons why we agree with the adjacent statute that that is so. So, first of all, just contextually, it seems to me it's quite natural when at step one of the proceeding there's an adjudication. Maybe it's conceded, but there's some kind of adjudication that the alien is, in fact, inadmissible or removable. And then the next step, the immigration judge is asked to decide, does this offense render the alien inadmissible or removable? I just think it's natural to talk about what just happened, rather than this new proceeding that imagines what would have happened if the person had left and tried to come back. I -- I also think that the -- the opening stanza of the cancellation of removal statute is actually quite good for us.
It says something to the effect of the attorney general may cancel removal for an alien who is inadmissible or deportable.
That's actually quite a lot like 1226, the mandatory detention statute, in that it has removal and then inadmissible and deportable sort of in the same breath. Do you dispute the fact that there are other provisions in the immigration laws in which inadmissibility is assessed at a time other than when an alien is seeking admission to the country? So I -- yes, I do. And let me walk through all of those because I don't -- it's almost like the exception that proves the rule in the cases that the government addresses.
So the primary example is adjustment of status or adoption of a temporary status, which I think is sort of a constructive admission, like you don't have to leave the country and come back. Well, I mean, when you say it's a constructive admission, ""constructive"" is a word that lawyers use in an effort to show that something that is not something else actually is that other thing, right? Yeah, but the point is you're -- you're trying to get into a new status, which is sort of like trying to get into a new country, like the status is as if you're being admitted into a new -- it's not like a latent -- the government says that in 1996 this like latent status was conferred on him that just stuck with him for all these years, which is different from when you're affirmatively seeking eligibility for a new status, which is kind of like affirmatively seeking eligibility to enter the country. So I think that's just conceptually different.
And, by the way, that doesn't apply to -- to LPRs like Petitioner.
There actually is no other concept -- context in which the concept of inadmissibility has any relevance to an LPR. When -- when -- The government also has -- -- when can an LPR fit -- fit that status? You say if he leaves the country for more -- more than 180 days. Yes. What other sit -- in what other situations can a lawfully permanent resident be subject to the status of ineligibility? So there's -- Inadmissibility? I'm sorry.
So there's several enumerated criteria.
Probably the one most relevant to this case is that the statute provides that if you've committed a crime on the inadmissibility list, under 1182, and then you leave, you need to seek admission again. Now there's one wrinkle on the specific facts of this case, that that statute doesn't apply to Petitioner because he committed his crime before the -- IIRARA's enactment.
But in the general mine run -- and we're not relying on that as the basis to decide this case. But what else besides leaving the country and coming back? So leaving for 180 days, abandonment of the status.
I think one of them is committing a crime in a foreign country, and -- and there's a couple of other ones. There's like a list of enumerated criteria in Section 1101. Could you go back and finish your answer to Justice Alito? I understand he asked about the other provisions -- Yes. -- that refer just to a status. Yeah. And you mentioned the first one, and -- Right. -- that seems somewhat logical.
But how about the others? So I think that the only other ones are these two, for these very narrow classes for temporary aliens, like certain entrance before 1982 and something about special agricultural workers. And, actually, those provisions in the -- in the sections talking about adjustment of status for those people, it also says that if they're inadmissible, they also have to leave. Their status is terminated. Those statutes were enacted many years -- I think in the '80s, many years before IIRARA.
So, I mean, it's different subject matters.
It's not about LPR.
They're enacted at different times.
I think they're less relevant in these cluster of statutes about removal which were all or almost all enacted in IIRARA itself.
They all address the same subject matter. To me, if you're going to look at consistent usage, those are the ones to use.
I actually think that like our best argument on consistent usage is maybe just the intro to the cancellation of removal statute.
And I -- I mentioned a few minutes ago, but I'd just like to elaborate a little bit. It -- it says the Attorney General may cancel removal for an alien who is inadmissible or removable -- or deportable, excuse me, and so like that's just like 1226.
You're talking about removal and inadmissible in the same sentence. And so it just seems quite natural that inadmissible is a reference to inadmissible at the hearing, right? And you can't actually cancel removable -- But the point -- the point of the overall provision is to allow cancellation of removal for those who've been in the U.S. for a long time and have had clean records.
You agree so far? Well, clean -- it doesn't have to be completely clean -- Right. -- but yes. But generally clean. Yes.
Right. Okay.
And on the clean record point, the statute excludes those who have aggravated felonies -- Yes. -- right? And then it excludes, arguably, two more categories, those who have the list of crimes that make you deportable or the list of crimes that make you admissible. So those are the three categories that seem to suggest if -- if those have been committed within the first seven years for those latter two, right? The aggravated felony at any time, but deportable crimes, seven years, the -- the inadmissible crimes, seven years. Why isn't that the overall structure to look at that makes you ineligible for cancellation of removal, if you understand the structure? Well, I -- I think the structure has a different conclusion.
I think it's -- it's quite relevant that for this aggravated assault offense here, Congress has actually decided that that's not a basis to deport him, period. So like it doesn't interrupt his continuous residence in the literal sense, that ICE can't come to his house and -- and deport him for it.
He -- Congress has decided he gets to stay here, so -- Right.
But the -- the point is you're already been determined that you're inadmissible or deportable. Yes. Now the question, are you eligible for cancellation of that removal, and the two things that Congress said we should -- that IJs should look at are, have you been here for a sufficient period of time and have you not committed certain crimes: aggravated felonies, deportable offenses within seven years, inadmissible offenses within seven years. If you've committed anything within those three categories, you're no longer going to be eligible for cancellation of removal. See, I'm not sure that's the right way to read the statute because what it says is, to -- to stop the clock, it's got to be a crime referred to in 1182, that's the inadmissibility list, and then that renders you inadmissible or removable. So the way I -- I look at that is that the first part of that referred to in 1182, that's the category of crimes that's capable of stopping the clock. And then there's the second part of the statute, which has what we see as, okay, not only does it have to be on this list of crimes, that's the first part, but it has to have this particular type of consequence, which is rendering you inadmissible or -- or removable. And, in fact, that leads to an argument we make about -- about surplusage, that it makes more sense to view the statute that way than the government's way because, under the government's position, at least until it filed its brief in this case, it conceded that the removable portion of the statute was total surplusage. The only way it can keep to its current position is by disavowing a BIA precedent, Garcia, correct? That's correct.
And not only does it disavow it, but, I mean, I -- I don't think that that's a -- it's a -- it's a very convoluted explanation.
It's not very plausible.
I mean, the government's position depends on this theory that what Congress was trying to do was distinguish between crimes that are expressly excepted from 1182 and that are merely not listed in 1182 and the exceptions, that's the -- the reason for the removal clause is to get these exceptions in, right? So 1182 says something like, all aliens except juveniles who commit crimes involving moral turpitude are inadmissible.
The government's view is that that's like very different from just saying all adults, even though those mean the same thing, because like juveniles are in the exceptions clause and, therefore, that stops the clock for purposes of cancellation of removal.
That's a very convoluted scheme. And especially -- and it's somewhat unlikely that the removable clause, which seems to be talking about removable aliens, was actually put in to get in those exceptions, it seems to me, now that the government has abandoned Chevron deference and what we're doing is just kind of lining up the two interpretations next to each other and seeing which one's better. I mean, our understanding of why the statute's written the way it is, is more plausible.
We say it's a -- You make a -- before you get to that, you make a fleeting reference to Chevron in your reply brief.
So do you want us to defer to something? Do you want us to defer to the BIA -- On the -- -- on anything -- Yes.
On -- -- or just on the decision that you like? Just on the decision that we like, Your Honor. (Laughter.) Well, that's what -- So -- -- the government is doing. Yes.
So -- It likes this decision -- I have a -- I have a -- -- but it doesn't like Garcia. -- I have a principled reason for that, Your Honor.
First of all -- I'm sure. (Laughter.) -- the government expressly waives Chevron deference -- Uh-huh. -- on the quest -- on this Jurado case, and so that's -- that's good for us.
I mean, it makes it much easier for us that now there's no Chevron deference.
And we walk through in our brief that the arguments given in this Jurado case are clearly wrong.
So this Court's cases hold that even if a statute's ambiguous, you don't defer to an agency decision that's clearly wrong, which I think is true for this Jurado case.
The government doesn't even try to defend it, they bury it in a footnote. Well, what about the simple, but it has a certain appeal, argument the government is making, this is a very dense statute, that if we ask why would Congress -- why wouldn't Congress want the clock to stop when an alien has committed a qualifying offense showing that he has abused the hospitality of the United States? Yeah.
So I'd like to turn to purpose actually.
It might be a good time to do that.
I think that, actually, our interpretation makes sense and we have very good reasons for why Congress would have wanted to do what it did. So, first of all, I think it -- it's at least somewhat relevant that Congress made the express decision that he shouldn't be deported for this offense.
It's true that he's deportable for other offenses, but Congress has also made the express decision that those other offenses shouldn't foreclose cancellation of removal. So, if both of those things are true, if you have this one offense which Congress didn't even think was serious enough to deport him at all, and then the other offenses which do make him deportable, Congress has decided to leave the door open a crack for cancellation of removal, to me, that sounds like Congress kind of wanted this person to be eligible for discretionary relief.
He doesn't have to get it, but at least have the door open. Rather than the scheme where, as the government contends, this conviction, which wasn't even serious enough to make him eligible for deportation simpliciter, kind of pops back into relevance and springs over the crimes for which he is deportable and becomes the basis for saying that he's subject to -- to mandatory deportability. And just one other thing about -- I'm not really understanding that. Yes. So there's a serious offense that makes you deportable. Yes. Okay.
Now the question is, are you eligible for cancellation -- Yes. -- of removal? And in looking at that, any blemish, even if it doesn't rise to the level of something that might have made you deportable, is a problem, Congress suggested, by broadening the list of things that could make you ineligible for cancellation of removal beyond those things that just make you deportable in the first instance. Why isn't that a better way to look at it? Because it didn't do that.
The reason that we're all here today is that the crimes that made him deportable, Congress decided that they actually don't foreclose eligibility for -- for a discretionary relief.
That's why we're only looking at this crime that didn't make him deportable. They don't on their own -- But you don't -- -- but if you have something else -- No, but the -- the scheme is it's not like it's an aggravating characteristic based on other things.
Like, there's -- you apply a test and there's certain convictions that apply and then it -- you can certainly use the same conviction for both in principle.
It's not like you take one crime and then you look at what other crimes he has. And so it just -- the -- the crimes that stop the clock just don't include the crimes for which he was found deportable.
So it -- it's just a little bit strange.
Like, you'd think that -- so he has this firearms conviction and the aggravated assault conviction and you'd think that, you know, either one is worse -- either one's worse than the other or they're the same level of bad from the purposes of the immigration system. But it's hard to imagine why a rational legislator and you decide, okay, for step one, for just removability, we're going to say that the firearms conviction is worse than the aggravated assault conviction, but, at step two, for the same alien in the same case, the sort of rank order of badness is flipped.
In step two, it's now the aggravated assault that's enough to foreclose discretionary relief, but not the firearms conviction.
That's a pretty common -- Well, it's because the timing -- Mister -- -- it was because of the timing. No, but that's actually not the case because both those convictions -- it's the same day and the same incident.
It's just the firearms conviction just -- because it's not in 1182, so it just -- it's not within the class of convictions that stops the clock. Well, why do you think, Mr. Unikowsky, if -- if -- if you're right that this statute is set up to look to the proceeding that's just happened, whether it's the inadmissibility proceeding or the deportability proceeding, why is it that it's -- that the statute is written just in terms of the inadmissibility grounds? Like -- So that -- -- well, why wouldn't you have something where the inadmissibility people have admissibility grounds and the deportability people have deportability grounds if there's this basic dichotomy in the statute? It's a little hard to explain, Your Honor.
I mean, that aspect of the statute is something that has puzzled the BIA as well because it -- the first part has only one and then the second part has both. But, I mean, you know, that's -- the BIA has said we have to construe that literally. Congress did this a -- it was very clear that they're asymmetric.
The first part is just one-half and the second part is both halves. They could easily have just put in 1182 or 1227 in the first part, and then we wouldn't be here because you -- the firearms conviction would foreclose. I guess my -- my thinking, though, is that it's -- it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle for both sides, but it's a little bit more of a puzzle for you because you emphasize so much the way the statute separates out two different classes of people. Well, that's true, but, I mean, the -- it's the second -- I mean, the second half of the statute that -- that does that.
I mean, I -- I -- it's hard to know what to make of that statement. So there's this BIA decision that holds that firearms convictions like Petitioner's doesn't trigger the stop-time rule. The BIA -- actually, the government in that case said that's crazy; it's just clear that's the purpose.
And then the BIA said, no, look, it's not clear exactly how the statute got to be written this way, but Congress required this asymmetry in which the first part, the referred to part, the category of offenses only has some. And Congress evidently decided that only some offenses, and not all, should even be capable of stopping the clock, just like it decided that just aggravated felonies should be capable of foreclosing cancellation, and then, in the second part, it talked -- looked at the effect on the alien. I just want to say one more thing about that.
I -- I think it makes a certain kind of sense to say that like if you're being deported for a particular crime, then that -- you can't use the time after that crime to be -- for purposes of continuous residence because, in a sense, it's just sort of bureaucratic delay, right? You've committed the crime, and then you're waiting for the conviction, and then you're waiting for the deportation proceeding. But sort of the die is cast when you've committed the crime.
And so there's certain logic to stopping the clock as of the commission of the crime that really doesn't work here, where Congress isn't even capable of deporting you based on this aggravated assault crime.
So the -- the delay after the crime has nothing to do with bureaucratic delay; it's just exclusively based on the fact that Congress has decided not to deport the person.
So it -- Could you tell me why you didn't rely on Lara-Terrazas? On -- on what, Your Honor? Lara-Terrazas. The Capitol Area Immigration Rights Coalition said the BIA read this provision pretty much as your second alternative previously. Well, I mean, I think that -- so we think the BIA has not decided the -- on the second question, so the -- Jurado clearly is inconsistent with our -- our -- our first -- No, but Lara-Terrazas appears to have held exactly as you wanted. I -- I -- I don't think that's a published decision that specifically resolved the question. Well, maybe not specifically, but the government's relying on unpublished opinions too. Yeah, I mean, we -- we -- I mean, there's a published decision -- I mean, obviously, in this case, there's an unpublished decision rejecting my -- my client's claim.
So I, you know -- and Jurado is the primary published decision that -- that's on point.
We acknowledge that it's inconsistent with our reading, but we said it just shouldn't be deferred to because it's irrational.
The government agrees with that.
And so that obviously makes this case easier for Petitioner. I will say that if the Court concludes the statute is ambiguous but nonetheless construes it our way, then, under the Brand X case, the BIA would be capable of reaching the contrary conclusion and the Court would be able to defer to that if it holds that the agency's reasoning is -- is reasonable.
That's what the Brand X case holds. But, you know, of course, if the Court holds that it's unambiguous, then the agency wouldn't be capable of doing that.
But, on the record currently before the Court, when there's no Chevron -- no precedential decision that the government is even willing to defer to or is willing to -- to defend and rely on, it's just like a criminal statute or any other statute where there's no layer of deference to the agency, the Court should just decide what it thinks it means in the first instance. What do you do with the government's argument that it would have been very easy for Congress to write the statute to link the stop-time offense to the offense charged in the removal proceeding? I mean, I think the statute could have been clearer both ways.
I mean, just looking at this good moral character provision, which is something we talk about in our brief, it's like a model of -- of draftsmanship and how clearly it could have been written our way.
I mean, that statute says that if you have committed a crime during the continuous residence period, that puts you into the classes of persons described in 1182, then the clock -- then you can't be eligible for cancellation, whether inadmissible or not. So that's like the clearest conceivable way of saying that if you're in the category of 11 -- of people under 1182, which the government says Petitioner is, that regardless of whether you're charged with inadmissibility, you're not eligible. So Congress said that was a requirement only for non-LPRs to seek cancellation of removal and not LPRs.
And this isn't just a matter of differently worded statutes.
It's as differently worded as they could conceivably be.
You have, like -- for non-LPRs, it says in the classes of persons in 1182, whether inadmissible or not, and then, for the stop-time rule, which also applies to LPRs, it requires that it renders the alien admissible. So, just to answer your question, I mean, yeah, certainly, you could have written it much more clearly our way, and, of course, we wish it was, but it seems to me that when -- you know, when there's just a crystal-clear statute that would have accomplished exactly what the government wants, which Congress applied only to non-LPRs and not LPRs -- Why would the -- why would the good time rule clearly resolve this -- never mind. Finish. Oh, why would it clearly resolve this -- this question? It doesn't say whether seeking admission or not. It -- It says whether inadmissible or not. Yeah, so it doesn't matter -- so we don't think Petitioner is inadmissible.
But it applies to the alien whether inadmissible or not, as long as he's in the classes of people in 1182, which he clearly is. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statutory text alone is enough to resolve this case.
The question is whether Petitioner has committed an offense that renders him inadmissible under Section 1182(a)(2). To find the answer, we look to the text of Section 1182(a)(2), and it says that any alien who is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible.
There's no dispute in this case that Petitioner has -- has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.
Therefore, he has been -- he has committed an offense that renders him inadmissible under Section 1182(a)(2), and that should be the end of the matter. Now Petitioner says there's an added requirement in the statute, that requirement being that he must be seeking admission.
But that requirement can't be found in the text of Section 1182(a)(2).
It can't be found in the text of the stop-time rule itself.
Rather, the stop-time rule ties the operation of the rule to an alien's status as inadmissible, independent of whether he is seeking admission or not. And in that respect, the stop-time rule operates in the same way as many other provisions of the INA.
My friend described some of those provisions as obscure, but I think they're anything but.
For example, we cite a number of them on pages 17 to 19 of our brief. One of them is 8 U.S.C. Section 1255(a).
This was a major part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986; 1.7 million aliens applied for relief under this section.
And what that section says is that those aliens would be ineligible for relief if they had the status of being inadmissible.
And that's so even if those aliens were already admitted and not seeking admission. Moreover, that -- that same section says, if, after being granted amnesty under that provision, those aliens then committed an act that made them inadmissible, that amnesty status would -- would have been terminated.
So it works just like the stop-time rule in this case and, indeed, mirrors the operation of that rule. Another example is Section 1160. That's another major part of that same Act. That said that -- that gave special temporary resident status to a certain group of agricultural workers; 1.3 million agricultural workers applied for relief under that section. It operates the same way. Even if those aliens had already been admitted and were not seeking admission, inadmissibility as a status was a cry -- was a criterion for their eligibility for that status. Well, your -- your friend on the other side, of course, cites statutes that are to the opposite effect in terms of how the term is used.
So it strikes me that this business about this is how they use it in other places, it's almost a wash. I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.
In our view, the word ""inadmissible"" means the same thing throughout the INA.
Every time the word ""inadmissible"" appears, it is referring to an alien's status under Section 1182(a)(2). What the stat -- what the statute does in other provisions is tie different consequences to that status.
So my friend mentions the judicial review provision in Section 1252(a)(2)(C). What that provision says is, if an alien's status as inadmissible, has the consequence of leading to a decision about his removal, then there's no judicial review in the courts of appeals. So, in other words, that -- that statute does exactly what the stop-time rule doesn't.
It refers specifically to the decision to remove and -- and -- and ties the operation of the rule to that. Same with the mandatory detention provision.
This is 8 U.S.C. Section 1226(a) and (c).
There's an explicit reference there to the decision whether the alien is to be removed. And what the statute says is, if the alien's status as inadmissible would result in that particular consequence, then that alien can be detained on a mandatory basis. Well, but, look -- look, the -- the main argument as I understand it -- and this statute is as obscure as any I've seen.
All right.
Look, let's read it. When the alien has committed an offense referred to in Section 1182(a)(2) of this title, so we go look and see.
Has he committed an offense referred to? Yes. Now then what? An offense that, A -- I put in the A -- renders the alien inadmissible or, B, removable under 1227(a).
Now, if you're right, there was no need for that clause, the second clause, because the first thing you do is look to 1182. 1182, if his offense isn't there, forget it.
It doesn't apply at all.
And if his offense is there, well, under your view, remove him.
That's the end of it. So what in heaven's name is removable from the U.S. under 1227(a) doing there? Now he has an answer to that question.
He says, I'll tell you what, the history of immigration law is that we treat differently applications for admission, even people we found in the United States, by the way, who never applied for admission, okay? Those are the inadmissible ones.
And those are the ones that what I called A applies to. And now what B applies to is everybody else.
They were properly admitted, yes, yes, and then they committed a crime deportable under.
Now he happens to fall, his client, within what seems to me is a tremendous fluke, that is, somebody who actually did something that is listed in 82(a) and yet, at least in his view, is not listed in 1227. I didn't know there was such a person. But, lo and behold, he comes up with this exceptions clause, et cetera, and says his client is there. Okay.
Now what do you say to that main argument, that there is A and there is B, and on your view, B serves next to no purpose? When Congress wanted to make A and B an either/or, it said so expressly in the Act, so -- I know, but I can't think -- that isn't going to be an answer because they'd say, sometimes they do say A/B, sometimes they don't say A/B, it wasn't a genius who drafted this and he forgot the A and the B and he -- but he did put in the or.
And so, all right, I've got that point.
What's your next point? My next point is I think -- well, I guess two points.
One is we don't think the renders removable clause is superfluous when the referred to in Section 1182(a)(2) clause is given its proper meaning, but -- and I'm happy to get into that.
Even if you don't buy that and you think there's some sort of question left -- Well, you're talking about the ones who are the -- the -- the under 18 and the -- and the -- there's an -- I -- I think I got that argument. Okay. And I can think that if -- I think I have it.
You're right about it. Okay.
Even if we don't buy that? Even if you don't buy that, I don't think surplusage should be the be all, end all in interpreting this statute.
Even under Petitioner's reading, the cross-reference to Section 1227(a)(4) was pure surplusage from 19 -- But, Mr. -- Mr. Liu, this is more than your typical case of surplusage.
I mean, obviously, surplusage sometimes gives way to other things.
But this whole statute, like the structure and the content of this statute, is all written to -- to refer to this essential dichotomy that Justice Breyer just set out.
I mean, basically, the back two-thirds of the statute is all about, well, the people who have been rendered inadmissible, and, on the other hand, the people who have been rendered deportable. And -- and you have to think that they wrote it that way because they were thinking of these two groups of people, each of which would be subject to different consequences and each of which should be looked to separately. I -- I don't think so, Justice Kagan.
And I'll just re-emphasize the point I made to Justice Breyer, which is, when Congress did want to create that dichotomy, it wrote that dichotomy into the statute.
So -- But by doing what? You said by saying either/or.
I mean, this statute says or.
You know, any writer would tell you, sometimes you put in an ""either,"" sometimes you just use an ""or."" Either way, it's disjunctive. It's much more explicit than that.
If you look at the page -- top of page 35A of our statutory appendix, you have Congress defining the meaning of the word ""removable."" And we acknowledge decisions to remove are the main con -- well, I think the only context in which Congress wrote into the statute this either/or. And how did it do it? It did so by defining ""removable"" as ""in the case of an alien not admitted to the United States, that the alien is inadmissible, or, B, in the case of an alien admitted to the United States, the alien is deportable."" That's how explicit Congress is.
It's not just -- Well, it's how -- -- either/or. -- explicit Congress could be, and, sure, that might be a model of legislative drafting which we can all assume this statute is not. But this statute does very clearly use the disjunctive as to two large clauses, one of which talks about inadmissible aliens and the other of which talks about removable or deportable, whatever word you want, aliens. And I think Congress was also clear in the cross-reference to -- to Section 1182(a)(2) and the renders inadmissible clause that any alien who is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible. There are many ways Congress could have written that provision to get to the result Petitioner would like us to get to.
There are other provisions in 1182 that tie the status of inadmissible to an alien who is at that time applying for admission or seeking admission. But, in 1182(a)(2) itself, Congress left those words out.
And I think usually this Court presumes that Congress acts intentionally and purposefully when it does something like that. Go back to the point that the Chief Justice made.
You're cherry-picking.
What Congress has not been is very consistent, except in what your adversary points to in the basic structure, that inadmissibility applies to people who have not been admitted, deportability applies to people who have been admitted. And each side is given a different set of rights.
Each side is given a different set of burdens.
Each side is given a different set of benefits or lack thereof. And I don't see what's illogical to say that what Congress was thinking about is, if you're in removal proceedings, you're eligible for cancellation of removal for those crimes that make you eligible, meaning, if you have to be mandatorily deported, you have to be mandatorily deported. But you've been here a long time. Whether a piece of it was in -- in BIA custody or not is irrelevant.
You get the same benefits for being a long-time resident as you do in all parts of the INA. You have to prove certain things in LPR status.
There are certain benefits given to LPR.
Why is that incongruous here? Well, I -- I -- I -- Especially when the structure of the very next provision, the mandatory detention section, is talking also about removability? I -- I want to be very clear.
I do not think we're cherry-picking at all.
We are giving the word ""inadmissible"" the same consistent meaning throughout the INA.
We are then reading the -- the language around that provision and sometimes that language points to a specific circum- -- a specific consequence of that status. This provision -- There is a consequence. -- attaches additionals. There is a consequence.
Both of them are tied around removability.
There is a consequence. You're -- or at least the ability to ask for cancellation. But the -- but the consequence here, which is termination of the period of continuous residence, is tied only to the status of inadmissibility.
Congress could have written even the stop-time provision itself in many different ways that would have captured Petitioner's reading. In fact, the predecessor version of this statute, former Section 1244(a), said, if the alien commits an act constituting a ground of deportation, that person is eligible for -- I -- I accept that you can read the word ""inadmissible"" -- I'm not saying you have to, but you could say this individual in front of us, he's not inadmissible. It's -- he's been admitted.
How could he be inadmissible? They admitted him.
Ahh, you mean he would have been inadmissible had he not been admitted.
Okay? (Laughter.) Now that's a possible reading of it.
And that's why just looking at the word ""inadmissible"" doesn't tell us whether we should read it with a ""he would have been"" or whether we should read it as ""would be now"" or -- there are 15 -- not 15, okay, got that. Now, once we're into that bog, we then go back to the original question of, why, in heaven's name, if all you had to do was first you look at 1182 and see if his crime fits there, and then you see if it made him inadmissible, for everybody.
Well, of course, it did.
It -- I mean, you know, there we are. And -- and what's this second part doing there? Unless it picks up -- Yeah. -- that traditional history.
Now that's the same question I asked before, same question Justice Kagan asked, and -- and that's, I think -- This -- -- what's bothering me.
Yeah. -- this is what we think Congress was thinking.
Everyone agrees that Congress began with the universe of offenses referred to in Section 1182(a)(2).
Everyone agrees that's -- that's text in the statute, you can't have a 1227 offense unless -- that stops the time, unless it's referred to in Section 1182(a)(2). And we think what Congress was trying to do was it looked across the INA and it said, look, we have identified in Section 1182(a)(2) a set of criminal and related offenses.
We think, in general, those are the offenses that rise to the level of being an abuse of the country's hospitality such that the alien's time would stop. And then Congress thought: Well, certainly, if those offenses are serious enough to render the alien inadmissible, those should be given stop-time effect. But -- And so -- -- why wouldn't you just say, you know, a person convicted of an offense listed in the following sections? You don't need all this hullabaloo about people being rendered inadmissible -- That's the point. -- and people being rendered deportable unless you're talking about some kind of proceeding in which people have been rendered inadmissible or people have been rendered deportable.
Otherwise, you could just say offenses listed in whatever statutes you wanted to say. Well, because I think, as -- as I was saying, Congress -- Congress did start out with the set of offenses it thought would generally be serious enough.
Those are the offenses referred to in Section 1182. Congress thought, well, if they're serious enough to render the alien inadmissible, they should certainly qualify as stop-time effect.
But, at the same time, Congress recognized that there were exceptions in Section 1182, juvenile offenses -- Yeah, but the exceptions -- -- petty offenses, that wouldn't be -- -- I mean, the idea that the exceptions would be picked up somehow if you just said listed in the -- it doesn't transform an exception.
An exception would remain the exception.
It's just the actual offenses that are listed in that statute. Well, I think that is what the ""referred to"" clause.
The ""referred to"" clause refers to just the offenses, the sort of the generic elements-based understanding of the offenses in the statute. The problem is I think Congress realized Section 1182(a)(2) contains a bunch of circumstance-specific exceptions to those -- Yeah, and -- -- to those provisions. -- I guess it seems really counterintuitive to me that Congress could have -- could have sort of looked down the road and said some insane judge is going to pick up these exceptions and transform them into actual grounds for disqualifying somebody from removal.
So the exceptions would remain the exceptions.
You don't need -- No -- -- all this statutory language to do that. No, that -- that -- that's my point, Justice Kagan, is that because of those exceptions, that's why you need the renders -- Yes, that's your -- If you -- -- point -- Look, if -- Can -- could -- could I take you back to Justice Breyer's intriguing question about the meaning of inadmissibility? The -- the Eleventh Circuit had some very colorful examples about status and words that end in a-b-l-e or i-b-l-e, and one of them had to do with rotten fish.
So, if a fish rots and it is inedible, they say, well, it was inedible before the person ate it. But, under Justice Breyer's interpretation of admissibility, suppose this person eats the fish and then goes to the emergency room to have his stomach pumped, would the doctor say, well, the fish wasn't actually inedible because he ate it? (Laughter.) No, no, you wouldn't, because the fish has the status of being inedible, whether someone has -- No -- -- eaten it -- -- but, Mr. Liu -- -- or is trying to eat it or not. -- this -- this really is dependent on context because you wouldn't say is car is immovable if the car has just been moved.
And so too here, it's not clear that you would say an alien is inadmissible if the alien has just been admitted. So, you know, it could; it couldn't. The -- the -- the real question is not what ""inadmissible"" means in the abstract.
The real question is look at this statute and say, why does anybody write a statute that looks like this, unless what the drafter is doing is to try to refer to two different categories of people who have just gone through two different kinds of removal proceedings? And I -- and I don't think it's an embarrassment for our position that, under our view, the ""renders removable"" clause has only a modest role to play.
Again, if you read the -- the text of the stop-time rule, you begin only with offenses referred to in Section 1182(a)(2). If Congress had wanted Section 1227 to play a sort of major role in the stop-time rule, it could have said offenses referred to in Section 1182(a)(2) or referred to in Section 1227. But already Congress is cutting off the application of 1227.
This is an inadmissibility-focused provision.
Two of the three provisions are about Section 1182(a)(2). I think it's only logical to read the third provision, which doesn't mention Section 1182(a)(2), as doing the relatively modest role, admittedly, of just picking up the things that aren't referred to or render an alien inadmissible. I -- I -- before you leave this -- I -- I'll think about the fish. I'm not sure I got the fish, but I'll -- I'll think about the fish. (Laughter.) But -- but I'm back in what in heaven's name is that clause doing there? You know, the second clause. Right. If you're right, okay.
So you've had very brilliant people going over this, and the best they've come up with, it seems to me -- tell me -- is, well, you see, there are exceptions in 1182, and there are -- those exceptions are not in 1227.
And they put 1227 in to be sure those exceptions didn't stop the person from being deported. Okay.
So I look at the exceptions. The only exceptions I can find that are relevant are those contained in (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(ii)(I)(2).
Those are the ones you're talking about.
And, by the way, it took me five seconds to put all those numbers in, but it takes a Congressman or a drafter only three seconds to read them. And I would have said ""including those listed in"" and then I would have put in that number.
You see? That would have done it. Including those listed in.
And I would have put that number in.
And then there would have been no problem, and then you would have thought of no reason at all. Now I've never seen a statute drafted, so many words, to cover removing so small an exception. But we know Congress wasn't working at that level of granularity, because when it came to 1227(a)(4), there was nothing in 20 -- 1227(a)(4) that's referred to in Section 1182. I think the only way to understand what Congress was thinking is to think of what Congress was thinking at a more general level. And the more general level is we have these offenses referred to in 1182(a)(2).
These are bad offenses.
If they're serious enough to render you inadmissible, that is, confer that status, then they stop the time.
But, if they are also happen to be serious enough to render you removable, those will stop the time too. That doesn't mean that you -- you don't apply the Section 1182 ""renders inadmissible"" language even in cases when aliens are admitted because Congress had written provisions in many other places of the INA where inadmissibility is indeed relevant, even when the alien is admitted. So Congress did not think there was some sort of disjunct between saying an alien was already admitted and yet he's inadmissible. It wrote the statute in exactly that way. That's confirmed by the language of 1182, which says any alien convicted of ""a crime involving moral turpitude"" is inadmissible.
It doesn't say any alien who is convicted and then seeks admission. It's clear from the other provisions, adjustment of status, temporary protected status, the two major parts of the Immigration Reform Act of 1986 that I mentioned at the outset.
It's even clear if you look at a provision of 1227.
1227(2)(a) -- (2)(a) -- 1227(a)(1)(A), deportable aliens, this is at 20a of our petition appendix, talks about aliens who at the time of entry or adjustment of status were within one of the classes of aliens inadmissible. There's no adjudication of admissibility at that point.
The whole point of this deportability provision is that the immigration officer failed to adjudicate that person as inadmissible. And yet, the statute refers to that person as having that status of inadmissible such that another consequence can be attached to it later on, in this case, deportability. We think the stop-time rule works in the same way. I know that everybody -- I think Justice Kavanaugh and you seem to think that these minor offenses, like a person who possesses a small amount of marijuana, can -- that can make you inadmissible but not deportable because there's an exception under deportability.
If it's a juvenile offense, you can't be deported. But what you're now saying is that these minor offenses stop you from getting the benefits, potential benefits, of cancellation of removal and that that was clearly Congress's intent. I don't know why I should think that is clearly Congress's intent, given that the LP -- that the INA throughout gives more solicitude to long-time -- to permanent residents. I mean, I -- I just don't see how we can turn the presumption on its head and say that they weren't intending to limit the stop-time rule to those who were in an admissibility status; covers small numbers of LPRs, the ones that have left the country and are seeking re-admission, and others, but I -- I'm -- I'm just not quite sure I understand why your reading is consistent with the solicitude that Congress has showed LPRs throughout the INA. I think it has to do with the very narrow issue in front of this Court. No one -- no one thinks that a marijuana possession conviction alone can render an LPR removable.
No one thinks a mere marijuana conviction alone can even render an LPR categorically ineligible for cancellation of removal. The only question here is a question of the operation of how long after having convicted that offense can that -- can that alien continue to claim credit for being in the United States.
That's a very narrow question. And -- But -- -- and our answer is simply -- -- the -- the problem really is, no, it's not so simple because they didn't or wouldn't have to worry about a small amount of marijuana generally, even an admission of it without a criminal conviction, and so why should the time stop under those circumstances? Well, there -- Other than your strange reading of -- of this provision. Well, I think the text does favor us.
But if you look at the cancellation of removal -- If it doesn't, where do we end up? If it's ambiguous -- If it -- -- where do we end up? If it's ambiguous, I think there would have to be some grievous ambiguity for the Court even -- to even care about that. I think the traditional tools of construction continue -- How about -- -- continue to apply. -- if it's in equipoise? If it's in equipoise, I still think the Court's duty should be to reach what it believes to be the best reading of the statute.
I don't think -- And so by ignoring surplusage completely? No.
I think surplusage is a problem for both of our interpretations.
I mean, even under -- He is a lot less. He gives meaning to everything except the reference to 1227(a)(4).
But doesn't 1227 -- it wasn't -- it was an empty category back then? Yes.
It's -- All right, I forgot that.
It was an earlier version. Well, since the stop-time rule was enacted in 1996, all the way until 2004, 1227(a)(4) was an empty category.
And even today, it's a largely redundant category because Congress has said in cases of certain permanent residents and non-LPRs under 1229(b)(A) and (b)(1), if you have a conviction under (a)(4), you're just categorically ineligible.
It's not -- it's not even a matter of stopping time.
If you have an (a)(4) conviction, you can't get cancellation right off the bat.
So, even today, that provision is not doing a ton of work. Mr. Liu, could you make sense of the verb tenses for me? Because I would think that you would have an extremely good argument if the tenses were subjunctive, you know, if it said -- if it would render the alien inadmissible.
But it doesn't say that. It says renders the alien inadmissible, which seems not to refer to something that could happen in the future if the alien, again, tried to gain admission. Right.
And I -- I -- I think the ""renders inadmissible,"" the present tense, just reinforces our interpretation because, if you look at the text of 1182 itself, it says any alien convicted of ""a crime involving moral turpitude"" is inadmissible. So, for the tenses to match, the present tense in 1182 itself to match with the stop-time rule, I think the present tense makes a lot of sense.
And I think this -- this is in partial response to Justice Breyer's question. Our -- our position is not a hypothetical alien would be inadmissible and, therefore, time stops for this alien.
Our position very much is, for this particular alien, this offense renders him inadmissible. And that just follows -- I mean, it -- -- from the text -- -- just is a kind of odd thing to say when we know the alien has been admitted and could be -- you know, could live here indefinitely if he hadn't gotten into other trouble, right? I don't -- Nobody walks around going, oh, you've been admitted, but, you know -- you know, let's -- let's -- let's -- let's try to figure out whether you're inadmissible if you try to -- if you try to gain admission the next time around? I mean, I -- I don't think that's right.
If I were a lawyer representing a client who had already been admitted, I would definitely describe the consequences of his status as inadmissible after he had committed a crime like this. And I would use the present tense to be exceptionally clear about those consequences. I think there is a different verb tense change here between ""alien has committed"" and ""renders inadmissible,"" but that -- that just, I think, dovetails with our understanding as well, because the ""rendering inadmissible"" always has to occur after the alien has committed the offense. Is your point about (a)(4) because it's an aggravated felony? No, no. What was your (a)(4) point? 1227(a)(4) covers security-related grounds -- Yeah. -- for deportability.
So, if someone has engaged in terrorist activity, for example, he would come within the scope of (a)(4).
If you look at 1229b(c)(4), this is on page 37 of our petition appendix, it says an alien who is ... deportable under Section 1227(a)(4) is simply categorically ineligible for cancellation of removal.
And that applies to two types of cancellation, not all the types, but the two types that we have been discussing here today. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Unikowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to begin by a comment that my colleague made that they are giving the word ""inadmissible"" the same consistent meaning across the statute.
That's just not accurate. So, in the mandatory detention statute, it says that an alien who is inadmissible by reason of having committed an offense under 1182 is subject to mandatory detention. Giving that meaning -- word the same consistent meaning, it would apply to any alien who merely has the status of inadmissible even if you've already been admitted.
That's what they say ""inadmissible"" means in the stop-time rule. They conceded that can't be right.
An already admitted alien can't be inadmissible for purposes of that statute.
So they are giving it a different meaning. Now the Chief Justice posed a question saying that, well, it seems to be on both sides and so it's a wash.
I think if it is a wash, that it's very good for us because there's all the other stuff.
There's the surplusage, there's the comparison to good moral character, and there's the structure of the INA and everything else. But I'd just like to push back a little bit on the idea that it's a wash because it seems to me that the statutes we're comparing it to are more relevant than the ones they are. So like this mandatory detention statute, it's covering removal procedures.
It was enacted in IRRARA along with the stop-time rule just a couple sections over.
That strikes me as more relevant than provisions that were enacted many years earlier that don't apply to LPRs at all, which is what the government is -- is relying upon. So I actually think that the consistent usage canon favors us, especially when you look at just the intro to the cancellation of removal statute that says the attorney general may cancel removal for an alien who is inadmissible or removable.
Like, that's using ""inadmissible"" in the way we say and it's the same statute.
In fact, like the stop-time rule is just a definitional provision under that umbrella. So the second thing I'd like to turn to is this question about the fish, which was a colorful question by -- by Justice Alito that the Eleventh Circuit relied on similar arguments. Look, we're not denying that it's -- that you can -- b-l-e words sometimes sound like a status.
Clearly, that's true, but it's just as clear that sometimes it's obvious that when you're talking about the removal proceeding itself, the word ""inadmissible"" refers to what happened at the removal proceeding. So I just think it's -- it's just inescapable that you have to look at the context in which the word appears.
I don't think that the Eleventh Circuit's comparison to undrinkable really can answer the question presented.
And in the context of the statute, which applies only during removal proceedings in which all the surrounding provisions seem to conceptualize this dichotomy between inadmissible and deportable, I think the context which you -- you just kind of have to look at ultimately favors our position. I'd also like just to say a word about surplusage, which I understand occupied a portion of the -- of the -- of my colleague's argument.
So, first, on this narrow issue of 1227(a)(4), just to be clear, it's not as though the government's interpretation gives that meaning that ours doesn't, right? So 1227(a)(4) was really an empty category at the time because it didn't have any cross-references to 1182. That's true on both sides.
So it's not -- it's not one of those cases where both sides give one word meaning that the other side doesn't.
Like for both sides, it's not clear why Congress included that, except for the purpose of subsequent amendments which actually did ultimately materialize.
But the surplusage on the government side is a -- is a lot more significant in the hope that the removal clause isn't there. It's not just a matter that there's surplusage.
I mean, surplusage is generally bad.
But I think here it's more than that.
You see the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" paired with each other.
And I think that just implies that Congress is thinking that those are the two things that can happen to you.
And if you're inadmissible, you fall in one bucket, and if you're removable, you're in another bucket. And we see all over the adjacent statutes this concept of inadmissibility and deportability together with an ""or"" in between.
And it's -- it's clear in all those contexts that that's why that's -- that's why they're there, because those are the -- the two true outcomes. So just in -- in the intro of the cancellation of removal statute, where it says the attorney general may cancel removal of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable. Clearly, the reason those two things are paired together is that those are the two things that can happen to you.
And so that's why they're both there. And the same in just the general statute governing removal procedures, 1229a, that says that the immigration judge shall decide the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien, it's clear why those two words are there with the ""or"" in between, because those are the two things that can happen. So you go to the stop-time rule, which, after all, is -- is just like a buried definitional provision in the cancellation of removal statute itself, and you have ""inadmissible"" or ""removable."" And the natural inference is that the reason those are there is that those are the two things that can happen. That fits our interpretation perfectly because, if you're found inadmissible, then you're in the admissible category.
And if you're found deportable, then you're in the deportable category, or removal category. Excuse me.
I think that's a lot more persuasive than this rather convoluted argument from the government which apparently the government didn't even think of until its brief in this case because it explicitly did -- did not make this argument in an en banc petition filed less than a year ago. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1618, Bostock versus Clayton County, and the consolidated case. Ms. Karlan. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII. The employer has, in the words of Section 703(a), discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing.
And that discrimination is because of sex, again in the words of Section 703(a), because the adverse employment action is based on the male employee's failure to conform to a particular expectation about how men should behave; namely, that men should be attracted only to women and not to men. There is no analytic difference between this kind of discrimination and forms of discrimination that have been already recognized by every court to have addressed them.
For example, discrimination against men who are effeminate rather than macho.
Like the discrimination here, that discrimination is because of non-conformity with an expectation about how men should behave. The attempt to carve out discrimination against men for being gay from Title VII cannot be administered with either consistency or integrity.
In the words of the en banc Second Circuit, it forces judges to result -- resort to lexical bean counting where they count up the frequency of epithets, such as ""fag,"" ""gay,"" ""queer,"" ""real man,"" and ""fem,"" to determine whether or not discrimination is based on sex or sexual orientation. That attempt is futile because when a man is discriminated against for being gay, he is discriminated against for not conforming to an expectation about how men should behave. Finally, the possibility that some employers, but not the employers here, may have policies of denying employment opportunities both to gay men and to lesbians does not change the unlawfulness of what was alleged by the employees here. Labeling those policies under an umbrella phrase like ""sexual orientation discrimination"" cannot hide the fact that such an employer is a double discriminator.
It discriminates against men who do not conform to a male stereotype, and it discriminates against women who do not conform to an expectation about female -- Ms. Karlan -- Ms. Karlan, how do you answer the argument that back in 1964, this could not have been in Congress's mind because in -- in many states male same-sex relations was a criminal offense; the American Psychiatric Association labeled homosexuality a -- a mental illness? Well, I think you read the words of the statute.
And this Court has recognized again and again forms of sex discrimination that were not in Congress's contemplation in 1964. In 1964, those were the days of Mad Men, so the idea that sexual harassment would have been reached, most courts didn't find sexual harassment to be actionable until this Court did.
In Price Waterhouse, this Court recognized that discrimination against a woman who cursed like a sailor, walked like a man, and didn't wear makeup was reachable under Title VII.
If you had asked members of Congress then what they had thought, they would not have been thinking about women like Ann Hopkins.
They -- How do you -- do you agree or disagree with Judge Posner's statement that the statute should be read to encompass sexual orientation discrimination to ""avoid placing the entire burden of updating old statutes on the legislative branch""? I disagree with Judge Posner.
I don't think you need to do any updating here.
I think you should read the words as they were understood then, which is men and women.
Title VII was intended to make sure that men were not disadvantaged relative to women and women were not disadvantaged relative to men. And when you tell two employees who come in, both of whom tell you they married their partner Bill last weekend, when you fire the male employee who married Bill and you give the female employee who married Bill a couple of days off so she can celebrate the joyous event, that's discrimination because of sex. Well, if no one has any further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. (Laughter.) Well, I think we'll have further questions. (Laughter.) What do you do with the argument that this is a non-discriminatory policy because it applies equally to relationships between women and relationships between men? In other words, your friends on the -- or -- or you emphasize that you need to know the sex of the individuals involved before you can determine whether or not there's a violation and that that brings it within Title VII. But what about the response that you do not need to know the sex of the people involved; you just can have a policy against same sex? So you don't care whether the participants are women or men.
If they're the same, then that's covered by the policy. I think that's no different than having a policy that says everyone should comply with the stereotype applicable to their sex.
And if I can use an example from the Court's prior cases, for example, in Dothard against Rawlinson, the policy on its face said you cannot guard someone of the opposite sex.
So a woman who seeks to guard a man is barred from that job; a man who seeks to guard a woman is barred from that job. Just put in, instead of the word ""guard,"" ""date"" and you get the same kind of rule here, which is a man who wants to date a man can't do it but a woman can, and a woman who wants to date a woman can't do it -- But there's, Ms. -- -- but a man can.
They are two forms of discrimination. Ms. Karlan, there's quite a difference.
In the Dothard case, it was the disparate impact.
There are many more male prisoners to guard than females.
So that policy, even though it applied to men guarding women, it had a disproportionate effect on women who wanted to be guards because there were many more jobs guarding male prisoners than female prisoners. Justice Ginsburg, the part of Dothard against Rawlinson that rested on disparate impact was the height and weight requirements.
The requirement about guarding the opposite sex was not a disparate impact.
At most, the Court noted in a footnote along the way that there were more guard positions available to men, but it was not a disparate impact case.
It was a disparate treatment case. And so a male person who had wanted to guard someone at the Julia Tutwiler prison, the prison for women in Alabama, would have had a claim that he had been discriminated against because of sex.
Now, he would have lost that claim but on BFOQ grounds, not on because of sex grounds. What do you do with the -- the example that was brought up that, unlike race, there are certain distinctions that are not only permitted but maybe even required between males and females, like physical fitness tests? So those -- I want to answer that question in two parts.
The first is to notice that in those cases, there is no question there's a differential be -- between men and women; that is, men and women are being treated differently. What is at issue there is whether that differential treatment constitutes unlawful discrimination under Title VII.
So, for example, in Johnson against Santa Clara County Transportation Agency, everyone recognized Paul Johnson was denied the job because of his sex, but because it was a permissible affirmative action program, that was okay.
In Dothard against Rawlinson, this Court said Ms. Rawlinson is discriminated against because of sex, but there's a BFOQ. So if Congress writes an exemption into the statute, that's one thing.
But this Court really shouldn't be writing in an exemption for those purposes. Do you think we need exemptions for those BFOQs? It's not just the -- physical fitness standards for different sports, but big issue right now raging the country is bathroom usage.
Same-sex bathroom usage. How are those cases going to be dealt with absent a congressional exemption other than Well, I think the way that they get dealt with is everybody agrees if you have men's bathrooms and women's bathrooms, that's because of sex.
It treats men one way, it says go to this bathroom.
It treats women another way, it says go to this bathroom. Then the question becomes is that permissible to do? And if I could just begin with an example that I think will show why this is so.
When I got up, the Chief Justice said to me, ""Ms."" Karlan, I am willing to bet any amount of money I have that when Mr. Harris gets up, he is going to say ""Mr."" Harris. He has treated us differently because of sex.
But that's not discriminatory because neither of us has been subjected to a disadvantage.
And as this Court said in Burlington White against North -- Burlington Northern against White, what the statute means when it says ""discriminate against"" is to cause an injury and requiring people generally to use separate bathrooms is not an injury. Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that maybe how they would see it.
And to what -- to what extent should we take that into account? And -- and same thing with a gender-specific uniform requirements. Sure. How would you deal with those, given that -- that at least those affected might think that they're suffering a harm? So there's no categorical rule about these.
For example, the fact that all of the men sitting at counsel table knew that they had to wear ties today and I was free not to didn't cause an injury.
On the other hand, even the dissenters in the Second Circuit said, if the Court said women who come to argue should argue in Hooters outfits and the men should wear -- No -- -- ties -- -- we're not -- we're not -- I mean -- I know. -- we can talk absurd examples -- No, but I can -- -- or we can talk real world examples. I will give you a real world example, which is, it probably doesn't violate dress code to require men and women in business events for the women to wear skirts, but if you required a female telephone lineman to wear a skirt -- No, no but are -- are -- -- while she's still -- I understand that. That's not what I'm getting at.
And you know what I'm getting at.
The funeral homes example's not a bad -- the case that we're about to take up is -- is -- is more in the -- in the realm of my question. Okay.
I -- You can offer me help if you want to. Yes, yes.
No, I'm trying to offer you help.
What I'm trying to say -- All right.
All right.
And what I'm -- what I'm suggesting, counsel, is that there are male and female bathrooms, there are dress codes that are otherwise innocuous, right, most -- most people would find them innocuous. But the affected communities will not. And they will find harm.
And how does your test deal with that one way or the other? That's what I'm asking you to address, if you'd like to. Yes.
My test says that you have treated the people differently because of sex, which is what we are asking you to hold here.
When you treat a gay man who wants to date a woman differently than a man -- woman who wants to date a woman, that -- that's discrimination. Then you get to what I've said, which is you have to ask whether a reasonable person under these circumstances would be injured by the imposition of the particular sex-specific world.
So when the Chief Justice calls me Ms., I am not injured.
When I go to a -- when I -- You -- you are not, but another -- It -- it -- -- person might be. Right.
And the question -- Are they reasonable or not? And -- and I'm -- I'm -- I'm just -- I'm wondering, how do you decide those cases? An idiosyncratic preference does not void an otherwise valid dress code or bathroom rule. So is it -- Ms. Karlan -- I'm sorry.
I -- I -- I -- and I apologize. Go ahead and finish it. Is it idiosyncratic for a transgender person to prefer a bathroom that's different than the -- the one of their biological sex? Is it idiosyncratic for a transsexual person to wish to dress in a different style of dress than his or her biological -- No. Sex? Okay.
So the answer to your question is -- the question then, at the end of the day, if I understand it, is that those are acts of discrimination under Title VII as you understand it? Yes, although I think you'd -- you'd be better advised to ask the question to someone who -- who is representing someone who is transgender.
I am representing someone who is gay. Ms. Karlan. And -- yeah. But you're begging Justice Gorsuch's question.
We were following up on the same thing -- I truly am not trying to -- -- which is -- -- beg the question. -- how do we differentiate the two? What is the legal test that you propose to say this is discrimination because of sex, as you said, calling you one thing and your friend another is discriminatory, but it's okay because there's no harm. So what's the test we apply to, say, when it is harm and when it isn't? Let -- let me try to be clear. Let's be -- It's not discrimination to call me Ms. Karlan and to call Mr. Harris, Mr. Harris.
It is -- it is because of sex that we were treated differently. But as this Court has made it clear several times, discrimination consists in an injury that the law is prepared to recognize. And generally across all statutes, this isn't a Title VII, and this is why I'm really not begging the question here, the Court has said de minimis effects are exempted from statutes presumptively. So if this Court thinks or if another court -- So why -- -- thinks -- -- is a dress code for Hooters that requires all women to wear a scantily -- a scant dress, is that discriminatory? Yes, it is. Is it discriminatory for the woman who just doesn't want to wear it because it's demeaning? Yes, it is. So how about, is it discriminatory for the restaurant not to hire a transgender man who wants to wear the uniform? Well, you're going to get -- The scant uniform. I -- I mean, I do want to get to the question of sexual orientation -- No, no, no -- -- here, but I understand -- I understand. But I think what you're, what you're alluding is, and I still haven't heard -- Yeah. -- the explanation, which is the question of how do we tell what's actionable and not? Well, if -- At what -- when does that discrimination become an issue? I'll -- I'll give an analogy from the race area that may be helpful to the Court, which is, for many years, there was an argument that separate but equal was acceptable.
And ultimately this Court concluded that when it came to race, separate but equal was not permissible. I don't think the Court has held anything like that with regard to sex, but you're going to have to answer that question about dress codes regardless of how you rule in either my case or in Ms. Stephens' case because -- Can I ask -- Would you say the test is is the person injured? Yes, it's a differential based on gender, but most people are not injured by having separate bathrooms. In fact, they -- most people would prefer it. So are you saying that we have to wait for the testing case for the person who might be injured by not being allowed to use the bathroom of the other sex? I think it highly unlikely you're going to see cases like that. The bathroom issue has been around since the beginning of Title VII.
Title VII has a special provision in 703(a)(ii) that says, when you segregate people, the question is whether that segregation denies them employment opportunities. And it is hard to see, quite honestly, how requiring men to use a men's room and women to use a women's room denies them employment opportunities. May I ask you to -- Are these -- Justice Alito. May I ask you to respond to what some people will say about this Court if we rule in your favor? And what they will say is that whether Title VII should prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a big policy issue, and it is a different policy issue from the one that Congress thought it was addressing in 1964. And Congress has been asked repeatedly in the years since 1964 to address this question.
The Equality Act is before Congress right now.
Congress has declined or failed to act on these requests.
And if the Court takes this up and interprets this 1964 statute to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, we will be acting exactly like a legislature. We might as well just take the Equality Act and issue that as our opinion and say, as Judge Posner said, that the courts need to intervene on questions like this when the legislative branch simply will not do so. What would we -- how would we respond to that question? Well, the fact that a loose cannon like Judge Posner says, ""do whatever you feel like"" is not what we're asking for.
We're saying, if you read the words ""because of sex"" and you ask, in 1964, what did those words mean? They meant treating men differently from women. So if in 1964 it would be discrimination to fire a woman who wanted to -- you know, a woman who enjoyed sewing, and there's a famous case, it's the foundational case on sexual orientation where they fired a man who said -- We will -- -- his body was -- We would not be deciding a major policy question that was not in Congress's mind in 1964, and then Congress has repeatedly failed to address in the years since then? No more than what you did in Oncale.
No more than what you did in Price Waterhouse.
No more than what you did in -- All right. -- Newport News. Is there -- is there -- in my mind, there are three basic parts to this case on the other side, to language. You've dealt with that. The parade of horribles, you've dealt with that.
And the third one is the one that Alito is bringing up in one form, as it comes out of the -- out of the briefs, as I read it in your opponent's brief. I would put it in these terms. Imagine a statute that says policemen, dah, dah, dah, must pay damages.
Passed a long time ago. That doesn't apply to German policemen. Doesn't apply to what kind of -- To German policemen. The meaning is the same.
German policemen are policemen.
But the statute doesn't apply to them. How do we know? Well, we know through a lot of history, dah, dah, dah.
Okay? Now, that's the -- that's the box in which I put the argument that Justice Alito made.
It's a serious legal argument, and the argument is that at the time Congress wouldn't have dreamt of this.
And, therefore, the words, though they apply, they meant to exclude the gays and transgender.
Now, what I need to hear is a clear answer to that question. I think the way to think about this is to ask about the specific behavior that's at issue, which is a man dates a man, and then ask: How does that fit within the language? And the best example I can give -- It fits. No, I'm -- I give you it fits. I'm -- I'm about to explain why -- Yeah. -- it fits.
Which is the idea was that people should not be denied jobs that they're qualified to do, award-winning advocates for child services like Gerald Bostock should not be denied a job, because they are a man who does something that if they were a woman, would cause no problems at all. So just to give an example from the first sex discrimination case this Court had, which was the Phillips against Martin Marietta case, a woman who has children at home should not be denied a job that a man who has children at home. Now, all you have to do is say those words apply also if it is a woman who has a wife at home -- Counsel, I -- -- rather than children. Several, I think about 23, states have been passing laws to address these -- these issues.
And I -- I don't know how many of them, but I think it's a big part of them, when they do extend the coverage against discrimination on the basis of sex to sexual orientation, transgender, they also include an exemption for religious organizations. Now, if we're going to be extending the -- the -- the understanding of what sex encompasses, and I know your argument -- Yeah. -- that that's not doing that, how do we address that other concern, that at least, I -- I think almost every state legislature that has extended it has felt compelled to address? Well, I -- I -- I would say three things about that: The first is this Court has already created an exemption for sincere religious belief for a large category of employers through the ministerial exception. The second is that Congress balanced these issues and has rebalanced them several times in the co-religionist exception. The third thing I would say is to understand this in context, which is 85 percent of American employers are not covered by Title VII at all.
So as to those employers, if they have religious objections to hiring someone who is gay, they're free to continue doing that. And the fourth is to make it very clear that the question is not whether people have religious objections to homosexuality; it's whether they have religious objections to hiring someone who is gay or lesbian.
And there are many employers whose own religious beliefs would tell them this would be immoral for them, who have no problem hiring gays and lesbians who are qualified to do a job. If I could just ask the Court to do one thing in thinking back to 1964, it is to look at the two foundational opinions on which everybody has played a game of telephone ever since. It's like your opinion last term in Argus Media, where you ask where did the idea that homosexuality wasn't covered come from? It came from first a case where a gay black man said he was being treated worse than gay white men.
It wasn't even a sexual discrimination case.
The second one came from a straight man who was fired because -- who was denied a job because he said his hobby was sewing.
And the employer said: That's an effeminate hobby, so I bet you're gay. If you look at the reasoning in those cases, you will realize that it was not until Hively that any court did a careful reading of the statute using contemporaneous methods of textual interpretation -- But you gave your -- -- and since then a majority of justices -- I mean a majority of judges have held that sexual orientation is a subset of sex discrimination. Justice Breyer characterized what I said earlier as conceding that sexual orientation discrimination fits the words of Title VII, but that we should take a broader view of what Congress had in mind. But that was not -- that was not the premise of my argument.
And your core -- the -- the parties have in their briefs, have all of these comparisons, and they will make your head spin if you -- if you try to figure them all out. But let me just go to your core one, which you began with today.
A man is attracted to other men.
He's fired, let's say.
A woman is attracted to men; she is not fired.
You say that's all you need to look at.
That's discrimination on the basis of sex, right? Yes. Okay.
That's not -- that's not correct, because there are two possible explanations for what happened there. It could be based on sexual orientation, or it could just be based on the fact that the employer wants -- does not want to hire men. Now, if you add in two other cases, that a man who is attracted to women, not fired, a woman who's attracted to women, is fired, then you have a much better idea the basis for the discrimination.
And it's sexual orientation. It's not sex. But in a case like the two cases before this Court where the employer had hired these men and they were already there, the supposition you made in your question doesn't apply, which is we know this is an employer who's willing to hire men. Indeed, the employer in Gerald -- I mean the employer in Don Zarda's case had only men as skydiving instructors.
So when he fires a man who wants to date a woman and he -- I mean a man who wants to date a man and he does not fire a woman who wants to date a man -- The -- the point is that discrimination on the basis of sex in the sense that Congress understood it in 1964 is a different concept from discrimination on the basis of -- Well, in -- -- sexual orientation. -- in 19 -- And that's what you're fighting.
You're trying to change the meaning of what Congress understood sex to mean and what everybody understood -- I -- I'm -- -- sex to mean in 1964. -- not trying to change that at all.
I'm simply saying that if a man and a woman both wanted to sew and you fire the man who loves sewing and you don't fire the woman who loves sewing, that's discrimination pure and simple, sex discrimination.
If you fire a -- if you fire the man who -- thank you. Thank you, counsel. Counsel. (Laughter.) Sorry. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: (Laughter.) Touche. In -- in 1982, Wisconsin became the first state in the country to pass a law banning discrimination because of sexual orientation in private employment.
The proponents of that law celebrated its passage as a landmark achievement for gay rights. According to the plaintiffs here, however, Wisconsin's landmark law actually had little, if any, practical impact because Congress had already banned sexual orientation discrimination nationwide, 18 years earlier in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. To quote Judge Lynch's dissent below, Congress did no such thing.
Sex and sexual orientation are independent and distinct characteristics, and sexual orientation discrimination by itself does not constitute discrimination because of sex under Title VII. That's just as true today as it was in 1964. The core error in the Second Circuit's holding is actually quite similar to the error that led this Court to reverse in Oncale.
In Oncale, the Fifth Circuit had held that same-sex harassment claims were categorically excluded from Title VII.
This Court correctly reversed and held that such claims may well be cognizable, as long as the plaintiff meets all requirements of the statute, especially what this Court called the ""critical inquiry into whether members of one sex were being treated worse than members of the other sex."" This case is just the mirror image of Oncale.
Whereas the lower courts in Oncale adopted a categorical exclusion, the Second Circuit adopted a rule of per se inclusion in which plaintiffs alleging sexual orientation discrimination receive a free pass around the critical inquiry into whether men and women are being treated differently because of their sex. In short, the Second Circuit simply changed the ultimate question from sex to sexual orientation.
But because both men and women may have same sex attractions or partners, a stand-alone allegation of sexual orientation discrimination cannot, without more, show discriminatory treatment -- Excuse me.
Can I understand your argument in context? Let's answer the question.
Employer looks at a man who applies and says: One of my hobbies is sewing.
And the employer says: That's an effeminate hobby.
You may be gay.
You're -- I'm not hiring you. So is that a mixed motive case? And -- and are we going to be trying somehow to parse that there's some sort of substantial legal difference between the belief that you're too effeminate or that a lesbian is too macho, whichever, from you're attracted to the other sex? How do you tease that out? Justice Sotomayor, I don't disagree that there will be tough cases at the margins, but the problem with what the Second Circuit did is they glossed over those hard questions and said: We're just going to adopt -- Well, aren't you -- MR. HARRIS -- a per se rule that if you -- -- aren't you glossing over the BFOQ, meaning, what it seems like you're confusing is three concepts, Title VII has causation and injury.
Not hiring, not firing, that's the injury. Now the question is what caused that? Being too effeminate, that's a sexual trait; being attracted to, if you're a man, to another man, that's a sexual trait.
It's caused by those two things. Aren't then we moving to the third question, which is: Is there a reason independent of your religious belief or your innate hatred and invidious discrimination for why you're treating this person differently? And if there is, you have a BFOQ.
You don't have to hire them.
You can fire them. But if there isn't, they're doing their job, and they're not bothering you, and they are not bringing their boyfriend or girlfriend, if it's the opposite sex, to a function to your private home because you don't want them there or whatever else is offensive to you, they're just working. So I don't understand why those are hard cases. Well -- Any harder than what the law applies for race discrimination, for religious discrimination, for any of the other forms, national origin discrimination. So, Your Honor, as this Court has emphasized in cases such as Johnson Controls, the BFOQ exception has been interpreted extremely narrowly, and so I think it -- it -- it is important as this Court emphasized in Oncale, the Court emphasized several times the need to ensure strict compliance with all requirements of the statute, including the discrimination element, because once you find discrimination, it gets very hard to make out the BFOQ. Would Oncale -- So I don't think -- Would Oncale have come out differently if the employer said, I don't hire women to work on platforms, the only people I hire are men? Well, that -- that obviously would have been discriminatory against the women seeking -- But it's not -- -- the job. -- the woman who is suing -- Right. -- it's the male who is being harassed by other men.
And the employer's defense is, you can't compare what I'm doing to someone who discriminates on the basis of sex between men and women because I don't hire women at all. So it's, of course -- it's -- it's not a complete defense or even a defense to say, I treat it -- in cases like Martin -- like Martin Marietta, it was not a defense for that employer to say, because I hired other women, it excuses this. So the answer to your question is that would not be a defense.
But -- That -- that was -- Martin Marietta was different because it was the plus.
The plus applied to women and didn't apply to men.
So you had that distinction. Well, take Price Waterhouse.
Suppose the employer said, I don't want any men who are not sufficiently macho, and I don't want any women who are not sufficiently feminine. If they -- the -- Price Waterhouse said we will treat a man who isn't sufficiently macho the same way we treated Ann Hopkins, there would be, as I understand your argument, no sex discrimination. I -- I disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg.
The way -- I think the best way to think of Price Waterhouse is, when an employer has certain traits or characteristics that it values in promotion and hiring and discharge decisions, there can't be a list of criteria for men and a list of criteria for women. So the Solicitor General offered the hypothetical that Your Honor said.
And -- and in that situation, there would be two sets of criteria.
And so maybe both a man who doesn't meet the women's criteria and a woman who doesn't meet the men's criteria would have a claim there. But -- but it wouldn't be -- it would not excuse it just to say that there are different criteria for each set. Well -- Suppose -- suppose a Catholic, Jew, want to get married.
Employer fires the Catholic.
Why? He's not against Catholics.
He's against intermarriage.
And obviously I can use the same example with race, which is famous. I take it from your argument that there would be no claim? There would, in fact, be a claim, in both -- Why? -- situations. Why? Why? All right. If there is a claim there, why isn't there here? So in the race context, the only difference between -- I didn't say race.
I said religion. Right.
In -- in the -- in the context of religion, which first of all religion is defined -- is the only one other than pregnancy which has an expansive definition. No -- Yes, it would be religious discrimination because between a couple that is Catholic and Jewish and two Catholics, the only difference between those couples is their religion. And the only difference between the two couples here is that one is a man rather than the woman. Except that it also introduces an independent characteristic, which can be completely -- All right. -- neutral to men -- So does it there -- why I'm not against Catholics, I am not against Jews, I am against inter-marriage? I -- if -- if that person or actor exists, I think it's foreign to our -- Oh, it exists. -- case law. I promise you.
There are many people, at least in the religious context, who are against inter-marriage and are not against Catholics or Jews.
That's not an unrealistic example. And all I find in that example is an identical case to this one. And I -- I think that -- I do think that most of the -- most people who would oppose any sort of interreligious marriage would do so for religious reasons.
And I would also note in the -- Mr. Harris, I think -- I think what all of these hypotheticals are about is that in many of our cases, what you find is what you said, what did you say, independent characteristics? They're all over our cases. If you take Manhart, which is the seminal case, Manhart was all about an independent characteristic.
It was about life expectancy.
But we didn't say, oh, we're going into some different sort of analysis where we don't just say would the same thing have happened to you if you were a man or would the same thing have happened to you if you were a woman, because we had an independent characteristic, which was life expectancy. Right. And -- and so the same thing here.
So all of these hypotheticals are really about the same thing, which is that Manhart gave us a very simple test, and Manhart said, what you do when you look to see whether there is discrimination under Title VII is, you say, would the same thing have happened to you if you were of a different sex? And, Ms. Karlan made all the -- you know, went through all the ways in which, obviously, the -- the same thing would not have happened to you if you were a different sex, you being her client. So, I mean, that's the question. There are independent characteristics in all these cases.
We have insisted on this extremely simple test.
If you apply that test, I guess it seems to come out against you. A couple things.
First, let me address Manhart and then address -- address the test more generally. So in Manhart, this Court noted that the -- the policy wasn't just about longevity. That -- that employer made no attempt to do any sort of bona fide underwriting or life expectancy estimates.
It simply charged the women more. So even a woman and a man, if they each had a 75-year life expectancy, they would be charged different rates, even though they were totally, similarly situated with respect to that. Yes, but Manhart was very clear that women in the aggregate were probably going to be fine under this policy, because women in the aggregate do have a higher life expectancy.
I mean, I think actually Manhart makes clear why another aspect of your argument is -- is wrong, because you say, well, we have to look at these big classes. Well, there was nothing wrong in Manhart when you looked at big classes.
What became wrong in Manhart was when you looked at individuals.
And when you look at individuals, which Manhart insisted one do, one should do, and when you apply the test that Manhart insisted you apply, would this woman have been treated differently if she were a man? The answer was yes. And, similarly, I guess I'm just going to ask you again, if you applied that test, don't you lose? And if you do lose, why should we not apply that test? Here's the problem with the test.
In Manhart, in Newport News, in Martin Marietta, the comparator test makes perfect sense because you know exactly what you're testing for, so the comparator helps you draw inferences from the evidence. The problem here is, unless the Plaintiffs can point to something outside the comparator to tell us why we need to hold sexual orientation -- to -- to tell us why that is irrelevant, they're -- they're just assuming their conclusion. So their comparator would say, you would ask if a gay man has suffered sex discrimination by comparing him to a heterosexual woman, which that version of the comparator can't isolate if it's the sex or the sexual orientation. And so I do think, unless they can point to something outside the comparator, to justify putting sexual orientation off limits -- Well counselor -- -- the comparator doesn't -- doesn't answer the ultimate question. Well, it certainly may not answer -- isolate the sole or proximate cause, but I -- I think the -- the argument on the other side is the language of the statute has a but-for causation standard, a more generous causation standard. So perhaps there are two causal factors at work here.
But isn't one of them sex in the narrow sense of -- of -- of biological gender? What's -- what's your response to that? Yeah.
So in the -- what I'm arguing is simply that sexual orientation standing alone is not, without more, sex discrimination.
And so the -- I'm sorry, remind me of the question one more time? Sure.
So the -- Right. Your -- your response to Justice Kagan was, I need to focus on sexual orientation because that's the sole or primary causal factor here for the firing. And I think the response from the other side is: But the statute has a more generous causal -- Oh yes. -- formulation, a but-for causal formulation, so perhaps you're right that, at some level, sexual orientation is surely in -- in play here.
But isn't sex also in play here because of the change of the first variable? Right.
So I think -- And isn't that enough? It -- it you know, the statute talks about a material causal factor or some formulation like that, not the sole cause, not the proximate cause, but a cause. And one -- one would -- in what -- in what linguistic formulation would one -- would one say that sex, biological gender, has nothing to do with what happened in this case? Yes, Your Honor.
So what you're referring to, I believe, is the motivating factor language.
And so, in what I just referred to as the sort of benchmark scenario, sex would not be a motivating factor there. If you look at Mr. Bostock's complaint, for example, and you strip out any mention of his sex as being a man -- again, we -- we dispute the allegations, of course, but it -- it would still make perfect sense.
But if you stripped out any reference to his sexual orientation, it would make little, if any, sense. And so in -- in Price Waterhouse, this Court helped give guidance about how to do the motivating factor analysis and said imagine you gave the employer truth serum and said what were your true reasons for doing this? Would one of them be the characteristic? And what I would call that -- that benchmark scenario -- All right, let's -- -- sex would not be -- Let's -- let's do truth serum, okay? Wouldn't -- wouldn't the employer maybe say it's because this was -- this person was a man who liked other men? And isn't that first part sex? Your Honor, I think in common parlance, we would call that a same-sex attraction.
And I want to be clear, if there is some reason to think that employer -- and some of the amicus briefs say that much discrimination against gay and lesbian people is -- is based on sort of animus against gay men or lesbian women. If there's some reason to believe that in that scenario, then that may well be a motivating factor, but when you simply have an employee saying I was fired because of my sexual orientation, that alone does not show that -- what -- what this Court called in Oncale the critical -- critical issue of distinguishing between men and women. Are you drawing a distinction between the literal meaning of ""because of sex"" and the ordinary meaning of ""because of sex""? And, if so, how are we supposed to think about ordinary meaning in this case? I don't see a difference between the two as far as -- and -- and the last point, running out of time, I think to go back to some of the questions about bathrooms and fitness standards, I want to be clear, under the Plaintiff's simple but-for test, if you truly simply apply the Manhart test or -- in the way they want to do it, I don't see any way that single-sex bathrooms or showering facilities -- You have to have someone who's injured.
You have to have someone who's injured.
And the response to the bathrooms is who is the complaining plaintiff? And for most people, they would not be complaining plaintiff.
They would not be eligible because they're not injured by the separate bathrooms.
In fact, they like it. Yes, Your Honor, although, of course, if someone, for example, is fired, imagine a factory with hazardous materials where people shower after work and to -- to clean up, and a -- a man used the women's bathroom and is fired.
That person would certainly be injured.
And I think, under my friend's test, they would say just change the sex and that person wouldn't have been fired. But here's the problem: That's not a similarly situated person.
The proper analysis would say that a neutral policy, such as use the showering facility that corresponds to your biological sex, the man who uses the women's shower, the -- the comparator is not a woman who uses the woman's shower.
It's a woman who uses the men's shower, because otherwise you're not -- otherwise you're -- you're loading the dice or you're not looking at similarly situated people. And the last thing I'd like to get into is this Court, in Espinoza, Footnote 2 -- I think there was some discussion of the states early on.
In Espinoza, in interpreting national origin discrimination, this Court said the state practice interpreting parallel laws is highly instructive.
And so I -- I think the fact that 22 or 23 states have done this by legislation and zero have done it by judicial interpretation, just shows that this isn't belt and suspenders.
It's not redundancy, that sex and sexual orientation both in 1964 and today are different concepts that mean different things, and common users of -- of language both today and in 1964 would have recognized that. Can they ever be? I'm sorry? I know -- can they ever be? Justice -- justice -- Judge Lynch below said that homophobic stereotypes are unrelated to sexual orientation.
The very first case before us shows that that's just not true, that homosexual orientation is highly correlated to people's stereotypes. If you're too effeminate a man, you're a homosexual.
If you're too macho a woman, you're a lesbian.
Happens all the time.
So I find it somewhat difficult to unwind the two. If not difficult, nearly impossible. It often is, Your Honor, and it's a sad reality that homophobic slurs are often directed at heterosexual or homosexual people to -- to criticize -- And that's okay under your theory? It is absolutely not, Your Honor, if that person can show discrimination because of sex, but what -- what the courts can't do is what the Second Circuit did and the Seventh Circuit did in Hively. Footnote 11 of the Zarda opinion is very candid about this where it talks about operationalizing its holding.
The Second Circuit is just going to change the jury instructions to tell juries that if they find sexual orientation discrimination, they've now found sex discrimination. So, Justice Sotomayor, I don't disagree that there will be difficult cases at the margins, but the answer is not to change the ultimate inquiry and replace it with something that Congress never could have intended. Well, if you have a minute, let me ask you this: Let's imagine that the decision maker in a particular case is behind the veil of ignorance and the subordinate who has reviewed the candidates for a position says: I'm going to tell you two things about this candidate.
This is the very best candidate for the job, and this candidate is attracted to members of the same sex. And the employer says: Okay, I'm going -- I'm not going to hire this person for that reason. Is that discrimination on the basis of sex, where the employer doesn't even know the sex of the individual involved? May I? Please. That would not be discrimination on the basis of sex.
And I think that's exactly right.
If you get a resume that -- that has a name that could be male or female, and there's something on there suggesting that the person is gay and they're not hired for that reason, that would be sexual orientation discrimination.
That has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with sex discrimination. Thank you, counsel. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue is not whether Congress can or should prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation.
The issue, rather, is whether it did so when it prohibited discrimination because of sex. It did not for two reasons.
First, sex means whether you're male or female, not whether you're gay or straight.
So if you treat all gay and men -- gay men and women exactly the same regardless of their sex, you're not discriminating against them because of their sex. Second, any doubt is removed by the history of Title VII and related statutes since, in the face of unanimous interpretation by the courts and the executive branch that persisted for decades, Congress has repeatedly extended other statutes to specifically cover sexual orientation, yet has refused to do so with respect to Title VII. The employee's position would nullify that conscious choice. And Justice Gorsuch, if I could first address your question about our -- my friend on the other side's argument about the literal meaning of the statute, well, there are essentially two responses to that argument.
And they're related. The first is that under that interpretation, you actually couldn't fire a man for using the woman's restroom because in some metaphysical sense, that man's sex is a but-for cause for his firing. But he's not -- The reason -- -- injured.
He's not injured. Well, he's fired, Your Honor, in my hypothetical.
And the reason why that is permitted -- I think counsel acknowledged all of that. Yeah.
And the reason why that's permitted, though, to do that, is because you're treating -- and this is my second point -- you're treating him the -- the same as a similarly situated woman; that is, a woman who uses the men's room. And that's always the critical analysis when you're trying to determine if somebody is being -- Is it -- -- discriminated against because -- Is it -- -- of their sex. Is it -- let me give you a not-hypothetical case.
An airline hires only women as cabin attendants, but it fires them if they marry.
The airline's defense is whatever we're doing, it's not sex discrimination against women because we don't hire any men at all, married or unmarried. That case, I take it from your brief, you would say there's no sex -- no violation of Title VII? Well -- well, no, Your Honor, because I think the problem is that the prohibition on hiring any male flight attendants would in and of itself violate -- That -- but -- -- Title VII. But the male is not complaining.
The complainant is the woman who was fired because she married. Okay.
So then -- The male complainant might have a very good case, but my case -- Right, and my -- -- is the woman. And my problem with the hypothetical is that the way it is constructed, there is, you know, presumably no men that have the job in the first place.
Now, if you say that in theory men should be able to have the job, then the question would be would you also have fired men who were married? And if you only fired women who were married but not men who married, that would plainly be a violation of Title VII because you're treating similarly situated people differently.
But to finish -- General, that -- that's an -- -- my answer to Justice -- -- an impossible idea to -- to put into practice by taking out the sex. May -- may I just continue with it? Yes, Your Honor. The hypothetical is not a hypothetical.
Its Sprogis against United Airlines.
And it was given, and not challenged, that they didn't hire men as cabin attendants. Right. But they fired this woman because she married, she didn't look like Cheryl ""Fly Me."" Right. Once she married, she wouldn't be attracted to the male passengers. The court of appeals said, Title VII was meant to strike out the entire spectrum of sex stereotyping, so if this woman was fired because she wasn't -- she would no longer be so attractive to men if she is married, that's sex discrimination. And we don't have to have a -- a -- a male involved.
This is a woman who was treated in a very stereotypical way.
She is no longer young and attractive when she married. Your Honor, I -- I -- I do think that the question is always, are you treating similarly situated men and women differently.
There are times where issues of proof are very difficult. For example, in the Price Waterhouse case, Ann Hopkins was fired because she was aggressive -- But this was -- -- because she was rude to staff -- -- this was an actual case.
This was an actual case and it was given that no males are hiring and no male is complaining. But, Your Honor, the way that actual case was resolved was because the woman had not brought her claim in a timely fashion on the sex discrimination piece. And so the way this Court resolved that decision was it said, all right -- The -- no.
This case -- -- she is being treated the same -- -- never came to this case, never came to this Court. Oh all right, so I guess I'm thinking of the wrong case. Sprogis against United Airlines, Seventh Circuit. General, could I go back to your opening statement and particularly to the second part of it? You talked about the history of -- of Title VII and some of the subsequent legislative history, and I guess what strikes me, and I was struck in reading your briefs too, is that the arguments you're making, I would say, are not ones we typically would accept. For many years, the lodestar of this Court's statutory interpretation has been the text of a statute, not the legislative history, and certainly not the subsequent legislative history. And the text of the statute appears to be pretty firmly in Ms. Karlan's corner.
Did you discriminate against somebody, against her client, because of sex? Yes, you did.
Because you fired the person because this was a man who loved other men. And part of that -- and it only has to be part, we've made very clear there's no search for sole cause in Title VII -- part of that is you fired the person because he was a man.
If he were a woman, he wouldn't have been fired. This is the usual kind of way in which we interpret statutes now.
We look to laws.
We don't look -- Right. -- to predictions. We don't look to desires.
We don't look to wishes.
We look to laws. Why doesn't that mean your argument failed? Because, Your Honor, I think that what our brief attempts to do, at least, is make a straightforward textual argument.
The law distinguishes between sex and sexual orientation. Those are two different traits.
And that's precisely why when Congress wants to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, it doesn't define sex as including sexual orientation.
It lists it as a different trait. What -- what is -- And so under Title -- What is your response to the two-comparator problem we've been discussing and the fact that at least one contributing cause appears to be sex? Well, Your Honor, a couple of responses.
First, I don't think that one contributing cause is sex.
I think that as long as you're treating gay men and women exactly the same regardless of their sex, the contributing cause is sexual orientation, not sex. And, two, I think it reflects the fact that sex and sexual orientation are different traits.
And if you do the analysis the way my friends on the other side suggested, you've completely eliminated the distinction between two very different traits and you've -- and you've essentially rendered -- you nullified Congress's careful -- very careful decisions in numerous other statutes to specifically protect sexual orientation and gender identities, we'll -- Is there -- Is there anything -- -- get to in the next case. -- in this record showing that the employers would not employ lesbian women? You know, Your Honor, in these cases, and this may have been a better question for my colleague, but I think in these cases, the employers have -- in the cases -- the sexual orientation cases, the employers have generally denied that they discriminate based on -- But all we know on -- -- their sexual orientation. Did this go -- the -- the -- the allegation is that the person was discharged when he announced that he was gay.
There's nothing in the record as far as I can see that there was a policy on the employer's part of discharging or not -- Right. -- discharging lesbian women. I think that's right.
I think basically the employer's defenses here were, one, I didn't fire him because he was gay, but, two, if you think I did, Title VII doesn't prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. And if I could address lastly the point that the Chief Justice and Justice Alito were raising about so-called legislative updating that Judge Posner suggested, here I think that a judicial ruling would be particularly pernicious because when Congress seeks to expand the scope of Title VII's liability provisions, it typically couples that itself with an expansion of the religious employers exemption to Title VII, precisely because issues of sexual orientation like issues of gender identity raise different issues from a religious liberty perspective. The employee's position here would only do half of that work.
It would expand the scope of liability without giving any consideration to those religious liberty interests on the other side of the balance, and that is precisely why this is the type of issue that is better left to Congress than the courts. Justice Gorsuch, I want to make sure that I fully addressed your -- your textual considerations, though, because I really do think it boils down to the fact that sex and sexual orientation are different traits. May I finish my answer? Sure. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on one of those traits, as long as you treat men and women who are similarly situated with respect to the other trait exactly the same, you're not ""discriminating"" under -- within the meaning of Title VII. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Five minutes, Ms. Karlan. Thank you. Let me start with the question that Justice Ginsburg asked because I think it's illustrative of contemporary sexual orientation discrimination cases. Virtually none of them involve an employer, and neither of the cases before you does, who claims to have an across-the-board policy of firing both all gay men and all lesbians. What tends to happen, and this case is illustrative of this, is a man who also doesn't conform with some other gender-based stereotypes and who is gay gets fired, which puts them in exactly the position that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, which is really devilishly hard to figure out what's going on here. The second point I just want to leave the Court with is, the entire argument on the other side depends on the idea that men who are gay and women who are lesbians are being treated the same.
And that's just not so. Because if you look at what actually causes the problem, it's the man who says, I married my partner, Bill.
If any woman who worked there had married Bill, he wouldn't -- she would not have been fired.
And he is. And you have to look, because the textual language tells you to, at such individual and not at the overall class. Ms. Karlan, would you address these -- General's statement at the end? He -- he goes back to the comparator should be a woman who -- a -- a man who likes a man and a woman who likes a woman.
You're trying to get to that. I -- I -- yes.
I think he -- he is varying two things there.
One, he is varying the sex of the employee and, second, he's varying the sex of the person to whom the employee is interested. And if two things that -- So give us an example from a case how you can't do that. I'm not sure -- of course you can do it but you don't have to.
Because all you need to do is show that sex played a role here. And if the answer is if a man had -- if a woman had come in and said, I like to date men, you wouldn't have fired her, and when a man says, I like to date men, you did, that's enough to show sex discrimination. But what if the decision maker makes a decision based on sexual orientation but does not know the biological sex of the person involved? Well, there is no reported case that does that.
And I -- All right. -- think the Court -- But what if it -- what if it -- -- can wrestle with -- What if it happened? We have had a lot of hypotheticals of things that may or may not have happened. What if that happens? Is that discrimination on the basis of sex where the decision maker doesn't even know the person's sex? And -- and how do they know the person's sexual orientation? Because somebody who interviewed the candidates tells them that. And they are unable to tell anything about the person's sex? No. So this is Saturday Night Live Pat, as -- as an example, right? (Laughter.) Well, I'm not familiar with that. Okay. But -- Which is the person named Pat, and you can never tell whether Pat is a man or a woman. I mean, theoretically that person might be out there.
But here is the key -- Theoretically what? Theoretically that person might be out there.
But here is the key: The -- the cases that are brought are almost all brought by somebody who says my employer knew who I was and fired me because I was a man or fired me because I was a woman. Somebody who comes in and says I'm not going to tell you what my sex is, but, believe me, I was fired for my sexual orientation, that person will lose. Well, if that's the case, then I think your whole argument collapses because sexual orientation then is a different thing from sex. Of course it is.
No one has claimed that sexual orientation is the same thing as sex.
What we are saying is when somebody is fired who -- Well, let me amend it. Your argument is that sex -- discrimination based on sexual orientation necessarily entails discrimination based on sex. But if it's the case that there would be no liability in the situation where the decision maker has no knowledge of sex, then that can't possibly be true. If there was that case, it might be the rare case in which sexual orientation discrimination is not a subset of sex. But in the case where the person knows the sex of the person that they're firing or refusing to hire, and knows the sex of the people to whom that person is attracted, that is sex discrimination, pure and simple. And it's important to understand that -- and -- and this goes back to something that Justice Ginsburg asked during the opening argument, that discrimination against gay men and discrimination against lesbians is not one thing. And in 1964, if you look at the members of Congress's brief, they will tell you if you looked in the dictionary there was no phrase ""sexual orientation."" That is a modern way of combining two kinds of discrimination: Discrimination against gay men, which goes back to Leviticus and the common law, and discrimination against lesbians, which was not part of Leviticus and was not part of the common law. Indeed, in 1964, there were only 16 states in the United States that clearly forbid some act in which lesbians could engage. So the idea that this is one large idea about sexual orientation discrimination in the abstract, without reference to sex, simply burkes the history and burkes the understanding. And if you look at the harassment cases, you will see why this is true.
Gay men are harassed in a different way than lesbians. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 19-465, Chiafalo and others versus the State of Washington. Mr. Lessig. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court: The cases -- the question in these cases is straightforward: Do the states have the power to control through law how an elector may vote? They do not.
The ordinary expected meaning of the words of the Constitution, against the background of the framers' deliberation, make it clear that the states have no such power. But what is also clear is that Washington does not like the Constitution's design.
It asks this Court to read the word ""elector"" as agent or, maybe better, minion, and it declares that the votes electors cast are not, as the Constitution expressly describes them, their votes, meaning the electors' votes, but instead are the votes of the state.
Article II in Washington's hands effectively gives the states the power to cast votes for President in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct. But the actual Article II does not give the states the power to cast votes.
It gives the states the power to appoint electors. And the actual electors that the Constitution creates have a legal discretion, as every elector does, not an unfettered discretion, as Washington puts it.
To the contrary, a completely fettered discretion, just fettered by moral and political obligations, not by legal constraint. Washington's alternative to ""vest discretion in citizens rather than electors"" may be a better plan, at least as part of a coherent change, but the question for this Court is not which plan would be better.
The question is which plan is the Constitution's now. And the answer to that question is clear in the Constitution's text.
The states get to appoint, no doubt, but they appoint electors who are then privileged to cast their votes without regulation by the state. Mr. Lessig, do you object to the pledge itself? Assume there's no fine or any other sanction.
Is simply requiring a prospective elector to take a pledge okay in your view? Absolutely, Your Honor. A pledge, understood the way Ray understood a pledge, having no legal obligation but a moral obligation, is perfectly fine pursuant -- as part of the appointment power of the state. Well, then -- so -- so the addition of a sanction makes no difference? No, the sanction makes all the difference.
So long as there is not a legal sanction, then a pledge is appropriate. It's the same -- the same in the context, Your Honor -- Your Honor, of -- of the -- of the Speech and Debate Clause. Of course, you can't punish somebody for a vote in Congress, but there's nothing inconsistent with the Speech and Debate Clause in asking a member to make a pledge.
Indeed, states right now ask members to make a pledge as a condition of being a party member. So, if there were a fine of one dollar, you would say that violates the Constitution, but if it's simply a pledge, no violation at all? That's right, because a fine is a legal obligation.
It crosses the line because the State has no such power to impose such an obligation through law. So your argument is not that the sanction must have coercive effect, it's simply a -- if it's only a symbolic requirement, it still violates the law? No, Your Honor.
It's symbolic requirement.
It's, of course, an important moral requirement.
It's a moral obligation when you take a pledge.
But it can't cross the line and become a legally coercive obligation, consistent with the freedom that the Constitution grants electors to vote by ballot. So, by legally coercive, you mean something different than simply coercive? In other words, if you add one dollar, that becomes legally coercive? That's right, just as, with the Speech and Debate Clause, if you fine a Congressperson one dollar for his speech or his vote on the floor of Congress, that violates the Speech and Debate Clause. But there's no problem with saying to that Congressperson, to be a member of the Republican party, you must pledge to support the platform of the Republican party. Under your view, there would be no way to enforce the popular vote referendum? The national popular vote compact, is that what you mean, Your Honor? Right.
I mean, assuming that gathers enough support and becomes law, there'd be no way to enforce it? Well, Your Honor, that obligation requires the states to pick a select slate of electors that fits with the winner of the national popular vote, and that slate of electors then would have the same discretion, legal discretion, that we believe any elector has. But, of course, if there's a national popular vote compact, the number of electors for the winner would be so significant, it would be very hard to imagine any discretion affecting the ultimate result. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Lessig, just a preliminary question.
Should we ask ourselves whether or not the State is granted the authority to regulate the vote of the elector, or are -- is -- should we ask ourselves whether the Constitution prohibits the State? Your Honor, I think you can ask the question both ways, and it's the same answer both ways.
The only argument the State has made in Washington, in the Washington case, is an argument grounded in the Appointment Clause.
They don't invoke the Tenth Amendment. So that would -- the question is whether the Appointment Clause gives them power to control, and we believe they do not. But then you can look at it from the other side and ask, as an elector who is given an obligation to vote by ballot, does that obligation entail a protection from legal regulation? And we believe, just as the Speech and Debate Clause does, it creates an immunity from being punished for how one votes. So when -- when you make your -- I'm curious.
When you make your federal function argument, is that -- does that depend in part on the fact -- on the -- on the -- your view that the elector has discretion? The federal function establishes the discretion, Your Honor.
It's exactly the same as in the cases of Hawke and Leser, where the question was a state legislature's -- a legislator's discretion to vote on an Article V amendment. And, of course, a state legislator works for the state.
He works for the people of the state, he works subject to the constitution of the state.
But what Hawke and Leser establish is that that state legislator is free of the impositions of the state, either through referendum or a constitutional -- the constitution itself, when that legislator votes on an Article V amendment. And that's the same immunity that we think a presidential elector has. How do we determine what the contours of this federal function -- of the federal function would be? I would -- I would look just to the text.
The federal function in balloting, as Ray described it, is the function in casting a ballot, as the Twelfth Amendment describes, and then the additional steps the Twelfth Amendment requires, which is to name the President and Vice President, make lists and so forth, sign and certify and send it forward. That's the function which the Constitution gives to electors, distinct from the power to appoint, which Ray also describes. But does the -- does the Twelfth Amendment mention discretion? No.
The Twelfth Amendment mentions the votes, and, of course, by requiring that someone make a list of the people that were voted for, it implies that there's more than one person that could be voted for. But, of course, the Twelfth Amendment also doesn't mention the State at all.
Yet the way the State conceives of it, the State -- the State is a proctor that stands in the room as the electors cast their votes, looking over their shoulder.
But that's nowhere in the Twelfth Amendment, Your Honor.
The State doesn't appear in the Twelfth Amendment, except to name where the electors will meet. You know, can the State remove someone, for example, that's -- I just wonder what limits -- what authority the State actually has here. Can the State remove someone who openly solicits payments for his or her vote? You can certainly -- of course, this Court has said in Burroughs and in Fitzgerald v. Green, the state can certainly regulate corruption, and bribery would be corruption.
And we believe that it's absolutely clear that the State has that -- the government has that power right now. So -- but where -- The question that -- -- so where's the authority? Where does that come from? Well, it's interesting, Burroughs itself, Burroughs versus the United States, of course, found it inherent in the federal power to be able to protect federal elections from corruption. In Fitzgerald versus Green, they saw it as incidental to the power to appoint electors to be able to assure that the election, in that case the vote by the people, was consistent with law. Either of those could create the authority to avoid corruption, but, of course, corruption, like bribery, is independent of the vote.
You don't need to police a vote to be able to police corruption, just as with the Speech and Debate Clause, you can convict a Congressperson of bribery even though the bribery includes the vote that might have occurred. Justice Ginsburg? Mr. Lessig, I was surprised with the answer you gave to the Chief about Ray.
I would have thought that under your absolute elector discretion view, Ray should have come out differently under your theory. No, Your Honor.
We think Justice Jackson in Ray was completely right about the original understanding, and we think Justice Jackson was completely wrong about what followed from that original understanding. The framers did believe that electors would exercise independent judgment.
That's absolutely clear.
But they did not inscribe that belief into the text of the Constitution. They could have.
Maryland's Electoral College had that text in the constitution to constrain the discretion in a particular way, but our constitution didn't, which means that the question in Ray was whether the State had the power to discriminate on the basis of political affiliation and loyalty when picking electors. And after the Twelfth Amendment, we believe that's perfectly obvious.
They have that power to discriminate because that's the function that the -- the Electoral College has come to occupy. It's somewhat hard to understand the concept of something I am pledged, bound to do, I have made a promise to do something, but that promise is unenforceable. I understand, Your Honor. And -- and it is -- it is -- it's difficult until we recognize how familiar it is.
Every single political pledge is of this character. We couldn't find a single case in the history of political pledges, a pledge that's been considered of anything beyond a moral obligation. We cited the Kucinich versus Texas Democratic Party case, where Texas requires candidates to pledge to support the candidate in the Democratic Party, and that was upheld exclusively on the ground that that was simply a moral obligation. And we can see that in the context of Congress again.
Again, there's no problem with requiring a member of the Republican party to pledge to support the Republican party as a condition of being a candidate for Congress. But we understand the Speech and Debate Clause to say you can't punish them for their vote.
And the pledge is not inconsistent with the Speech and Debate Clause.
It's perfectly consistent because a pledge is always and only a moral obligation. Thank you. Justice Breyer? Thank you.
Good morning. Counsel, a state can appoint people, requirement, that they be permanent residents of the state.
That's all right, isn't it? Of course. Of course.
And then could they say, and you must be a permanent resident at the time that you cast your vote? Yes. Yes.
And then what happens if, in fact, Mr. Smith, who is a permanent resident when elected, changes his residency and goes to a different state before the vote is cast? Now he is not a permanent resident.
He hasn't met the State's requirement.
And so could the State also say, in case that happens, we have an alternate who will cast the vote? Yes, we believe they can because -- They can, all right. -- it's a requirement -- What's the difference between that and this situation, where they say, you must promise to vote for the person who wins the most votes, and then he gets to the room, and in that room, he doesn't live up to that requirement, just as he didn't live up to the requirement that he be a resident of the state? Your Honor, the difference is the line between the appointment and the voting.
The Constitution draws that line.
It says that Congress can set the time of the appointment and they can set the day on which the vote is cast. And we believe incidental to the appointment power is to -- the power of the State to assure that there is an elector there who will perform the function, the federal function of balloting.
But, once the voting starts, the State disappears.
The State does not appear at all, except to name the location of the vote, in the Twelfth Amendment.
It certainly doesn't stand there to observe whether someone's voted properly. If, in fact, he changes his residence 10 minutes before he casts his vote, then you could remove him? Prior to the -- But, if you say he can't -- they can't, the State, when, in fact, he actually casts the vote, but surely a person who casts a vote for Jones instead of Black has, in fact, changed his mind 10 minutes before, and so can you not, in fact, remove him because of that preceding change of mind 10 minutes before? No, because the pledge is a pledge made prior to the appointment. There's not a pledge in my hypothetical.
It is a requirement that he, in fact, cast his -- not cast his vote but that he, in fact, be a person willing to cast his vote for Mr. Jones, the majority winner, at least 10 minutes before. I'm just trying to make it as close as possible to the person who changes his residence 10 minutes before. But, again, Your Honor, the Constitution gives the states no power to regulate the vote.
They have the power to appoint.
And incident to the power to appoint, Ray said they can say you must make a pledge to support the party nominee. And at the time my clients made their pledge, they absolutely intended to vote for the party nominee.
So the regulation that's authorized by Ray has nothing to do with what you've described, which is the regulation of the vote. Justice Alito? Justice Alito? Yes.
Mr. Lessig, my question is similar to Justice Breyer's, or at least it follows along the same lines. Suppose an elector is bribed between the time of the popular vote and the time when the electors vote.
Can the State remove that elector? Your Honor, we believe that prior to the vote, the State's power is -- the incidental power exists to assure that the person who shows up has not engaged in criminal -- is not engaged in a criminal activity. It's difficult to imagine how that plays out, though, because, of course, the claim someone has bribed -- been bribed is a charge. It needs to be proven.
And so we believe there's going to be a difficulty there with the bribery. But let's remember that the framers expressly considered this problem.
George -- George Mason expressly said a reason not to have electors is that they could be bribed.
But what the framers saw is that there were two risks. There was the risk of elector bribery, but there was also the risk of cabal and corruption, as Madison put it -- Well, I thought your -- -- if you give -- -- argument was that -- your argument must be either that the electors cannot be removed by the State -- the State says that at least some removal power goes along with the appointment power.
So I -- I think your argument has to be they can't be removed, or there are at least some circumstances in which they can be removed. And if there are some circumstances in which they can be removed, such as when the elector has been bribed, why would the violation of a pledge not be one of those circumstances? Your Honor, we -- we have said the bribe is different from a pledge because, of course, the bribe is proven differently from -- separately from how one votes.
So we've recognized that there's a capacity to regulate bribery. But what I -- I -- your question is perfectly framed, because I do want to assert that there's no power to remove prior to the vote.
The power that comes from, for example, 3 U.S.C. 4, which Congress gives the states the power to fill vacancies, is the power to fill a vacancy once the vacancy occurs.
It's not the power to create a vacancy. And -- and that's the structure that the Constitution establishes as well. So the State cannot create a vacancy by removing an elector who has been bribed? Yes, unless the bribery statute makes as a -- a penalty a removal from office and there's a conviction prior to the actual time at which the vote has been taken, but that's, of course -- Let me ask you one other question if I can.
Those who disagree with your argument say that it would lead to chaos, that in -- where the election -- where the popular vote is close and changing just a few votes would alter the outcome or throw it into the House of Representatives, there would be -- the rational response of the losing political party or elements within the losing political party would to be to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors, and there would be a long period of uncertainty about who the next President was going to be. Do you deny that that is a -- a good possibility if your argument prevails? We deny it's a good possibility.
We don't deny it's a possibility. And we believe there are risks on either side, which is a good reason to avoid the risk-adjusted constitutional interpretation. We agree that, of course, the possibility exists that you could flip electors. But look historically at the number of times that could have mattered.
In fact, in the history of electors, there has been one elector out of the 23,507 votes cast who have switched parties against the majority party in a way that it could have mattered.
That was the very first time this happened, Samuel Miles in 1796. Justice Sotomayor? In the ordinary close election -- Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, you compare in your brief the Electoral College to a jury, arguing that they are structurally similar under the Constitution.
You can't remove a juror because of his or her vote. But, if that's true, I don't see how that helps you.
A juror makes all sorts of pledges: to be impartial, not to discuss the case with anyone during the trial, not to research the case with the parties, to tell the truth during voir dire.
Yet, if a juror is selected and violates one of those pledges, say the juror talks about the case with the other jury members, the judge is empowered -- with others than the jury members, the judge is empowered to remove that juror. So why isn't a presidential elector subject to being removed in the same way? He has made a particular pledge, different than remaining impartial, but he has told the people who have appointed him: I will vote in this particular way.
I -- you call it morally -- commit myself.
So why isn't that any different than a juror who says, I'm not going to do this, and then does it and a judge can remove him? Well, Your Honor, you've identified the core immunity that a juror has, and that is the immunity in the vote to convict or not.
And we agree that is an immunity that cannot be regulated, can't be punished.
It can't be fined for a vote improper according to the court or to the State, though there are other obligations, you're right, that you can be held to account for. We think that's perfectly parallel with the presidential elector.
The presidential elector has an immunity in his or her vote. But, of course, sitting in the elector room, he can't cause a disturbance, he can't threaten somebody with a weapon, he can't engage in any number of criminal activities that might, of course, interfere with the opportunity to perform the duty. There's no general immunity.
There's a particular immunity because the immunity to vote is an immunity from penalty for vote, just as the Speech and Debate Clause cases have made clear. Now you rely a lot on history in your argument, but doesn't McPherson undermine your position very directly, just like Ray does in some extent? In those cases, the -- in -- in those cases, the Court made clear that whatever the framers expected -- and, here, you make a good argument that some of the framers originally expected electors to have discretion -- that historical practice since the founding offered a practical interpretation of the Constitution. That's what Ray said. And McPherson said experience soon demonstrated that the electors were chosen simply to register the will of the appointing State.
Don't -- doesn't -- Your Honor -- -- that same principle undermine whatever you think some of the framers expected that historical -- Your Honor -- -- practice, at least since the Twelfth Amendment, has shown that states have imposed not just pledges but have imposed fines and some removal of electors who are faithless? Your Honor, first, no state has ever, prior to 2016, imposed a fine to remove an elector. But number two, our argument has nothing to do with expectations.
It is the State's argument that hangs on expectations. What we say is that the Constitution, as McPherson says, should be read not according to modern-day expectations but according to the words, the ordinary expected meaning of the words the framers used in the Constitution. So, in McPherson -- Justice Kagan? -- the question -- Mr. Lessig, so let me ask you about those words.
As I understand it, most of your argument depends on a particular reading of the terms ""vote"" and ""ballot"" and ""elector,"" and, of course, you know, usually we think of those terms as involving some choice but not necessarily. People are electors, at least formally.
People vote, at least formally. People cast ballots, at least formally at times when there is no choice.
Think of a Soviet-style system or, you know, think of somebody who has -- has pledged himself to -- to vote because another person is voting another way. So why do these terms necessarily involve choice in the way you suggest? Well, Your Honor, we believe, as Chief Justice Roberts has described, that the best way to understand these words, the best dictionary is the Constitution itself. The Constitution speaks of elector in two contexts.
Article I speaks of what Justice Thomas has referred to as congressional electors, unique voters.
And we believe the freedom of congressional electors is exactly the freedom of presidential electors. And we understand the authority of this Court to establish that the office, as Justice Kennedy put it in his opinion in Thornton, the office of the elector, the elector there meaning the congressional elector, is created by the Constitution and it's free of constraints, either private constraints or state constraints.
So it's the same sense of elector that the Constitution used. Now, of course, they could have said, we mean by elector in Article I someone who has freedom and discretion, but, by Article II, we mean what will become the Soviet Union conception of elector.
That would have been possible.
We're not saying it's impossible to imagine this. We're saying the ordinary expected meaning of these words would have supported the discretion that absolutely the framers expected electors would have, and that -- If that's right, Mr. -- -- these were in -- -- if that's right, Mr. Lessig, if -- if -- if your reading is -- is very deeply contextual, then shouldn't we look to what happened in the very first elections under the Constitution, where, you know, immediately, right away, electors associated themselves with a political party, pledged their votes ahead of time, and -- and it's that practice that has continued for over 200 years? So, if your reading isn't demanded by dictionary but is instead demanded by context and history, doesn't the context and history suggest the opposite? Your Honor, we believe the context and history supports the idea, absolutely, that electors were to pledge themselves.
We're not saying that the Constitution required them to be Hamilton's philosophers.
That's not our claim. Our claim is that the discretion that they created in the office of elector survives. So, yes, look at 1796, where the first so-called faithless elector, Sam Miles, switches sides, which, of course, is noticed and objected to. And, indeed, in 1800, that election also was complicated by the failure of electors to do what they were expected to do.
Gallatin noted that to Jefferson and said to Jefferson, we should eliminate electors.
And Jefferson said, yes, let's have a -- Thank you -- -- amendment -- -- counsel. Justice Gore -- Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, could a state, for example, ask an elector to make a sworn statement as to his present intention to vote for a particular candidate, make the pledge an oath? Yes. And could a state later prosecute that elector for perjury if that statement under oath -- if there's evidence that that was a false statement? In principle, absolutely, Your Honor.
We think, in practice, that would be just like with a Judge making a promise to a Senate committee upon confirmation -- prior to a confirmation, it would be incredibly difficult to imagine enforcing in a way that wouldn't be just retaliatory against a particular elector. And could a state say that we'll pay your expenses and give you a per diem for your service, but only if you carry out your promise to vote in a particular way that you pledged initially? No.
That's what Washington's new law, in fact, does.
That is, in effect, a penalty as well. Why -- why couldn't it do that if it could do the other things? Well, again, Your Honor, the difference is between a legal consequence or a legal penalty based on your judgment, your vote, a federal function of balloting, which is free of state control, and the other incidental powers relative to appointment. And so, in appointment, I want to make sure you're an honest person -- I'm sorry for interrupting, but I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I understand where -- where you're going, so I just want to cut -- cut to it if we can. So a state -- and my -- my last hypothetical is just simply saying, we'll pay your -- your -- your lunch, your -- your -- your travel and your per diem if -- if you conform to your pledge under oath.
And -- and -- and that's not permissible, but it is permissible to -- to convict a -- an elector for perjury? I'm just not -- Well, that -- -- certain about that. Well, that's right, Your Honor, because perjury involves a false statement at the time the pledge is made.
In our case, our electors absolutely intended to pledge -- to vote for Hillary Clinton if Hillary Clinton won the election. I'm -- I'm not asking about your client.
I'm -- I'm -- just stick to the hypothetical, counsel, please. Okay.
But the hypothetical imagines that someone has committed a criminal act.
Okay, on the basis of the criminal act, in theory, they could be punished, that's right.
But the difference between an elector who gets compensated based on their vote or not based on their vote is a difference driven by the substance of the constitutional discretion that electors are given, the -- the federal function in balloting, the right to vote. And -- and with respect to the perjury example, could a state remove that individual and -- and not count his vote? Your Honor, the perjury example does not allow them to remove the individual, no.
And what we know in the context of other areas where votes have been tainted, for example, a bribery conviction which involved a vote in Congress, is the vote is not -- not counted.
That's just a consequence of the separation between the prosecution and the -- Well, I'm sorry, I thought you indicated to earlier questions that you thought it was fine for a bribed elector to be removed from office prior to voting. Yeah, I said that if you convict and convict the person prior to the actual voting, then you could remove them if it was -- Okay.
The same -- same would be true of perjury, I suppose, then too? No? If you could structure the statute and -- and succeed in the conviction, but, of course, the perjury requires at the time a false statement. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Lessig.
I want to follow up on Justice Alito's line of questioning and what I might call the avoid chaos principle of judging, which suggests that if it's a close call or a tiebreaker, that we shouldn't facilitate or create chaos. And you, I think, answered and said it hasn't happened, but we have to look forward, and just being realistic, judges are going to worry about chaos.
So what do you want to say about that? It's a good thing to consider, Your Honor, and what we've said is yes, on the one side, you might worry that there's a increased risk of ""chaos"" if electors have the discretion we believe they've always had. We suggest that the likelihood of that -- that is tiny given it requires electors who are the loyal of the loyal to band together in dozens or, you know, three dozen in the last election and flip sides.
And, of course, the likelihood of that is extremely small. But what we've also said is there's risk on both sides.
The Twentieth Amendment self-consciously presupposed electoral discretion in the context of the death of a candidate prior to the vote in the Electoral College. And if that happens, but laws like Washington and Colorado ban the exercise of discretion, then the votes from those electors could, in principle, be wasted.
And that could throw the decision into the House and that could flip the result, also unexpected, also potentially creating chaos.
So there's chaos both ways. And the number of times we've had candidates die is actually twice as frequently as we've had candidates -- as we've had electors switch their votes and vote for somebody from the other side.
So in the face of -- Okay.
Let me -- can I -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
I want to -- Sure. -- get to another question. You set this up appropriately as, in essence, the states versus the electors in some sense, but isn't it also appropriate to think of this as the voters versus the electors and that your position would, in essence, potentially disenfranchise voters in the state? Your Honor, of course, in our case, the action of the electors was to further enfranchise the voters in the case -- in this case. As a general theory -- They are trying -- -- as a general theory -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- wouldn't your position potentially lead to that? It's potentially true. That's -- that's right, Your Honor. Okay.
And then the last question is -- the question here is not whether the Constitution requires the states to bind electors; of course, it's whether the Constitution permits states to bind electors. And on that question, why doesn't the Tenth Amendment, as Justice -- or the -- the states' authority, preexisting authority, as Justice Thomas was suggesting, come in? Well, Your Honor, first, of course, the State doesn't invoke the Tenth Amendment, but, if it did, it would fail because, whereas, in the Thornton case, for example, Justice Thomas could point to traditions that allowed the states to exercise the power that they wanted to exercise there, there is no tradition in America, maybe in the Soviet Union, as Justice Kagan -- Kagan suggests, but not in America, of a government exercising control over a voter, over an elector.
That power doesn't exist.
Therefore, it's not a question of whether it was taken away by the federal government.
It wasn't given -- it wasn't there before.
And, therefore -- Thank you, counsel. -- there's no Tenth Amendment power either. Counsel, thank you.
You can take a minute to wrap up if you'd like. Thank you, Your Honor. The question here has got to both be the constitutional and the pragmatic.
And the constitutional question is simply the question whether there is a power in the states which comes from the power to appoint.
And there isn't. And it is also the question whether the electors as electors, the same sort of electors that Article I creates, have a discretion.
And the discretion is the same discretion which Congresspeople have when they exercise their judgment not to be punished at all under the principles of the Speech and Debate Clause. But there's also a question we acknowledge of the risks, but facing risks on both sides, this Court should do what it can do, which is to interpret the Constitution as the Constitution was written and it has not been amended. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. General Purcell. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution gives states the power to appoint electors.
That power has always included the power to set conditions of appointment, such as requiring that an elector live in the state or show up for the Electoral College meeting. One condition that states are clearly allowed to impose is that electors promise to support the presidential candidate preferred by the state's voters.
States have been choosing electors on that basis since the founding.
This Court approved that condition in Ray.
And the other side admits that states can impose this condition. The only dispute here is whether states can enforce this condition or any other valid condition of appointment.
Petitioners say no, or at least that's what they said in their brief.
They say that states cannot remove or sanction electors after appointment for any reason, even if the elector is being bribed or blackmailed, even if they lied about their eligibility to serve in the first place, or even if they refuse to show up for the meeting of the Electoral College. That is not the law, as Petitioners now seem to acknowledge.
Constitutional text, original understanding, historical practice, and this Court's precedent all demonstrate that states can enforce valid conditions of appointment like those here. Now I'd like to start by discussing original understanding because Petitioners want you to believe that this case presents a conflict between our country's long-standing practices and the framers' intent.
But two stubborn facts refute their claim. First, the framers and their contemporaries clearly understood that states could remove or fine electors after appointment. From even before the Twelfth Amendment, many states had laws removing or fining electors for violating the conditions of their appointment, repudiating a central premise of Petitioners' claim. And, second, as this Court recognized in Ray and in McPherson, from the very first presidential election, states have been choosing electors specifically because they had promised to support a particular presidential candidate. And this contradicts Petitioners' claim that the framers viewed the exercise of discretion as central to the elector role, and it shows that Petitioners' quarrel is not just with our long-standing practice; it is with the framers themselves.
Accepting their position would mean concluding that the framers misunderstood the role they had created. General -- Now, if you're -- -- could the legislature appoint whomever they want to be an elector? Your Honor, there are certainly some limits on -- on the discretion. Other constitutional provisions, such as the Equal Protection Clause, impose limits, of course.
But, in general, states have exclusive authority, as this Court has said, to -- to appoint electors and to set conditions of appointment. And -- and, certainly -- Well, let's say after -- they don't appoint electors in any way before the -- the national vote, and then they select the electors that they would like after that vote.
Is that all right? I don't think that's all right, Your Honor.
I would a need a few more facts to know for certain.
But the -- the risk there is that, once the State has given to the people the right to vote for President, that right is fundamental, as this Court has recognized.
So the state legislature cannot override the will of the people by appointing electors to do something different after the fact.
So -- so that would not be acceptable. But -- but the State does have the authority to enforce valid conditions of appointment, such as just requiring that an elector show up for the meeting of the Electoral College. And on the other side's view, even that is unacceptable.
And as you heard today -- I'm somewhat confused by exactly what their position is on this -- but it seems they're saying you cannot remove someone even if you know they accepted a bribe unless you can somehow move through the criminal process before the electors meet. And that's just absurd.
It's -- it's completely contrary to the historical record, and it leads to a dangerous consequence, Your Honor, that there's a huge incentive, under the other side's view, for -- for those who want to meddle in our presidential elections, whether it be a foreign power or just a wealthy individual, to attempt to bribe or blackmail electors. And it's quite easy to imagine a foreign government hacking into the computer of a few dozen electors to find embarrassing information about them and try to get them to change their votes.
And if there's nothing -- Say the State -- -- the State can do about that -- -- let's say the State law for electors say that they have to vote for the slate of the party that sponsors them and that they will be certified as electors, unless the circumstances after the election have changed to the extent that the legislature thinks the electors ought to be changed. In other words, not unbridled discretion with the legislature, but a condition known to the electors before they were selected. Would that be all right? Mr. Chief Justice, I think that raises the same challenge as your earlier hypothetical, that while the legislature in the first instance has the power to set, you know, any condition that complies with the Constitution, once the legislature has given to the public the power to vote in a presidential election, they cannot override that vote, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause and this Court's cases. So -- so, you know, your hypothetical, I think, pushed up against that principle.
And it's not just what commitment are you asking the electors to make but what have you told the public about their role.
And, of course, under the other side's theory, the public role we currently think of as the presidential election process, the campaigns, the debates, the rallies, the voting, is all irrelevant and always has been.
It's purely advisory. And so -- So that all they have to do is tell the public that when it comes to electors, we're going to follow Mr. Lessig's view? I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't understand that.
I don't understand the question.
The -- Well, the question is you're -- you're suggesting that the critical factor is whether the State's conduct is based on a condition prior to the selection of electors, and if the electors know that they have the discretion or that the State -- excuse me, that the State has the discretion to replace them and the people know that, shouldn't that be enough? No, Mr. Chief Justice. My -- my -- my -- the critical point is that if the condition is constitutional, then the condition can be enforced by removal or by sanction, just as it has been since before 1800. So, if the condition is you have to show up for the meeting of the Electoral College, the State can enforce that.
If the condition is you have to pledge to vote for the candidate chosen by the state's voters, we know that's a valid condition, the State can enforce it.
So that's the crucial -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes, thank you, Chief Justice. General Purcell, just to -- to clarify, could you give us precisely some of the limitations on the restrictions that the State can impose on elect -- on the electors? I understand you can require them to show up for the vote.
I understand that the -- you have the limit of what's constitutional. But, beyond that, what -- what -- what else limits you? Well, I think those are meaningful limits, Justice Thomas, and those are the limits -- this Court has said that the power of states over appointment is exclusive, is plenary. Obviously, as I said, the Equal Protection Clause imposes limits.
Other constitutional provisions, like the Presidential Qualifications Clause, impose limits, such that states can't, for example, restrict electors' choice of who they can vote for in a way that would violate the Presidential Qualifications Clause. But, other than that, the states have plenary authority to appoint electors and to set valid conditions.
And if -- if the condition is valid, if the condition is constitutional, then the condition can be enforced.
That's -- that's our position. Yeah.
Well, I guess that's why we're here, but one other question. The -- I'm interested in, you know, the -- what you think and how we -- how you would define the scope of the federal function concept. Your Honor, I think there's three crucial problems with the other side's federal function argument. The first is that it's just not even supported by the cases they cite.
Burroughs and Ray mention federal function in the sense that there is a federal interest, obviously, in the conduct of presidential elections, but they don't say or imply in any way that the Supremacy Clause restricts state authority over electors. And -- and then second, the -- the whole point of the federal function doctrine is to prevent state interference with actions of the federal government and with actions of federal officers.
And in this context, the federal government does not elect the President. And federal -- and electors are not federal officers. And the third point, Your Honor, is a historical one, that if they were right about this federal function idea, then states never ever would have been able to remove or sanction electors for any reason.
And -- and yet we see statutes from even before 1800 in many states that provided for exactly that, for removal or sanction of electors. And under the other side's theory, those statutes have always been unconstitutional.
And under the other side's theory, the State can't remove or sanction an elector for any reason as far as I can tell from their -- their theory.
Even if we -- even if the State knows the person has taken a bribe, the State cannot remove or replace them. Even if the State knows that the person is not going to show up for the meeting of the Electoral College, the State cannot remove or replace them, even though states have been doing that, again, since before 1800. So -- so I just don't understand how the other side's theory is at all consistent with the original understanding if it's not -- it's just not the original understanding.
It's an academic theory that has never been put into practice. Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg. What do you make of the fact that Congress has never failed to count an anomalous electoral vote, not once? It has always accepted the anomalous vote. Justice Ginsburg, I think that highlights Congress's view that it should defer to states about the votes that they certify to Congress to count. Of course, in every example that the other side's given, the State had certified those votes as the State's votes.
But, if you look at 2016, Congress also counted the votes from Colorado and from Minnesota, where the state replaced faithless electors with electors who promised to vote as pledged and did vote as pledged, and Congress counted those votes as well. So what you see in the history is Congress deferring to the State's designation of which electors are validly appointed by the State. Thank you. Justice Breyer? Thank you. Counsel, I'd like you to assume, whether this is Mr. Lessig's argument or not, assume this is my argument for present purposes. The only thing a state cannot do is to punish the elector for the way he actually casts his vote.
As far as bribery laws are concerned, there are plenty.
As far as gratuities, all kinds of things, what he's doing before, he'd accepted a bribe or promised to before.
The only thing is the actual casting of the vote. Now there, as to that, what would happen -- and there have been quite a few faithless electors.
For the most part, it hasn't mattered. Where it really might matter is if somebody died or some catastrophe happened or worse.
There, it might matter.
And in the one case, Congress refused to count votes which were cast for the person who was promised, Horace Greeley, and so there is a mechanism in Congress to protect catastrophe; namely, they count which ballots they choose to count. The alternative is your alternative, which is the State tries to control it.
Which is the greater danger, which is the greater safeguard: to have a Congress that will decide what to do with the faithless electoral vote or to have the State possibly, who knows what they could pass as a requirement? Now what is your opinion about that? Well, Justice Breyer, there's a lot there and I want to start by addressing your last question about what can Congress do. Congress cannot solve this problem because Congress cannot appoint an elector for a state.
So if -- if -- even if Congress could reject a ballot, for example, if it found out -- if it knew that the elector had been bribed, the State has lost that electoral vote and cannot get it back. The State cannot -- the Congress cannot appoint a new elector for the State.
And just rejecting that ballot might alter the outcome of the presidential election, rejecting several ballots might.
So the idea that Congress can solve this after the fact is just -- it's not true and it -- and it -- it -- it -- it ignores the constitutional delegation of power to the states. Turning to your other points, I mean, there's just no -- I want to -- an example I think helps illustrate why there's really no constitutional difference between failing to show up and failing to keep your promise. Imagine two electors who both do not like the nominee eventually -- who eventually wins their party's nomination and is -- is -- and wins the general election.
One says, I'm not going to show up for the Electoral College meeting because I don't like this person.
The other says, I'm going to show up and I'm going to vote for someone else. Both have violated valid conditions of their appointment.
Both can be removed and replaced by the State.
And there's no constitutional problem with that.
There's no -- But there is a difference between the two.
And in the one case, your State is punishing the person for what he does before voting.
In the other case, he is punishing him for the way he casts his vote. Well, two points. And that is what I think the -- the other side says is the one thing the State cannot do. First of all, Justice Breyer, we -- Washington's revised law now removes the person before they can vote, just as Colorado's law does.
Washington's prior law did impose a fine for breaking your pledge, for violating the condition of appointment. And -- and there's nothing wrong with that.
If you look historically from even before 1800, states had fines for violating conditions of appointment.
And so -- and -- and it's also quite common for appointed officials at the state and federal level to potentially face consequences for -- for voting in violation of a promise. So, for example, the United States ambassador to the U.N. certainly has a vote in the U.N. General Assembly, but if -- if they vote differently from how the President directs them, the President, of course, can sanction them or remove them. So -- so it's quite common with appointed officials that they can face consequences for voting differently than they've promised.
And -- and -- and that's what this is just a straightforward example of. Thank you very much. Justice Alito? Thank you. Counsel, does the Constitution impose any limits on a state's power to attach conditions to the appointment of an elector? Some, Justice Alito. The -- the ones I was referencing earlier. Obviously, the State cannot impose conditions that themselves would be unconstitutional, such as race-based conditions, for example. Okay. But our big -- sorry, go ahead. What else? Well, as -- as I said before, the State can't impose conditions that would violate the Presidential Qualifications Clause.
You know, other constitutional limitations might come into play if -- if the -- you know, I mean, it's hard to imagine what -- but -- but -- but our basic point is that if a condition is constitutional, and we know this condition is, then that condition can be enforced.
That's the key question, is -- is the condition itself constitutional. Could a state require electors to cast their votes for the candidate chosen in a resolution passed by the state legislature after the popular vote is cast? No, Your Honor.
That's -- that's what I was trying to say in answer to the Chief Justice's question as well.
That would violate the public's fundamental right to vote, once they have been granted that right by the State, and -- and violate the fundamental -- their fundamental right to vote. Well, I didn't quite understand that answer.
Is a state obligated to choose electors through popular vote? No, Your Honor.
As -- as -- at the beginning, in the early days, the legislature can choose electors directly if it wants.
And in -- in that circumstance, the legislature can impose and enforce a pledge. But once the elector -- sorry, once the legislature has given the power to -- to vote to the public, the public now has a fundamental right to vote and to have their votes counted equally and -- as this Court has said in a number of cases.
And so -- and so the -- the legislature can't then override that vote after the fact. Why -- why is that so? Could Washington say we're going to choose five wise people -- I -- I'm sorry, 12 wise people to be our electors and we are going to allow the -- the public to advise them through a -- a -- a popular vote, to give them the sense of what the people of Washington want? Would that be unconstitutional? If the legislature made clear that the public vote was entirely advisory, then -- then -- then, you know, I think that presents a tough question, but I think they probably could do that. You know, the -- the key compromise of the Constitution as to electors was to leave it to states to decide exactly what authority they would have.
States were free to decide to leave electors with discretion, as some states did then and as some states still do today. But states were also free to choose electors on the basis of who they had pledged to support, as -- as many states did from the beginning, and as -- as the majority -- What -- what is the difference -- -- of states do now. -- between -- what is the difference between that setup and the setup that Mr. Lessig says is required? Well, Your Honor, the -- the -- the crucial difference is that Lessig is saying there's nothing the states can do to remove or -- or sanction electors after appointment for any reason, and we are saying that we know from history and we know from Ray, and the other side even admits, that this condition of -- of pledging to support the candidate preferred by the State's voters is a conditional condition.
And that condition can be enforced just like any other constitutional condition.
That's the key -- that's our key point. And states have been removing and replacing electors for violating conditions of appointment since before 1800.
States have been choosing electors specifically because of who they pledge to support since the very beginning. If the other side were right about how electors were supposed to operate, what you would have seen historically is electors trying to convince legislatures and the public to choose them because of their great wisdom and knowledge.
They would have been saying: Choose me.
I will -- I will decide well on your behalf. And that is never ever how American presidential elections have operated.
Electors were chosen because of the candidate they had promised to support.
So to adopt their view would be to radically change, to radically change, how American presidential elections have always operated. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, I'm curious about your views on the Tenth Amendment. The other side points out that you never raised it.
Two of my colleagues have referred to it. But am I assuming correctly that Thornton sort of puts a quash on relying on the Tenth Amendment in a situation like this? This is a new procedure that Congress intended, so the states can't say that they expected or reserved a right in something they never knew they had? Well, Your Honor, we didn't explicitly argue the Tenth Amendment, but we don't -- we don't think we need to rely on it, and we -- we support our colleagues in Colorado in making that argument. We think that the -- the -- the fundamental premise of the Constitution is that, you know, states have -- the federal government is one of the enumerated powers; states have powers unless they're taken away.
Nothing in the Constitution restricts state authority to impose conditions on appointment of electors and to enforce them. And even if that weren't the case, the text itself gives states power to appoint electors.
That phrase -- this Court has repeatedly said the appointment power -- inherent in that power is the removal of power, unless there's contrary language.
And the original understanding has always been that the appointment power of electors included removal power, as you see in the early statutes. So -- so, you know, I don't -- I don't think the Court needs to rely on the Tenth Amendment to resolve this case.
I think -- but -- but -- but I think it -- certainly, the background principle that states have powers unless they're limited by the federal Constitution is relevant and -- and supports our side. Now you rely on a default rule in your brief, which you haven't mentioned yet, which is the power to appoint includes the power to remove. But all of the examples that you rely on are vertical appointments, when an official within one branch of government appoints a subordinate in the same branch for an indefinite period, and the idea is, I -- if I appoint you, I should be able to get rid of you if, in your service to me, you are doing something wrong. But, here, the State is appointing a voter to do something that most people think of as requiring judgment and -- and -- judgment and some measure of freedom, which is the power to cast a ballot.
The other side, in its brief, points out that there were other words that would have connoted -- that would have connoted something different than elector, like a delegate.
You appoint a delegate to cast a vote for you. But that's not what Congress chose. In appointing an elector, an elector has a sense of someone who's going to vote.
So how -- how can you say that that tradition within the executive branch of the power to remove is controlling here? Justice Sotomayor -- Sotomayor, there's really three fundamental problems with the electors' argument on that front.
There's a -- there's a textual problem, a historical problem, and a -- Well, I don't think it's their problem.
I think it's your problem. Well, like I said, they -- none -- none of the cases say anything like what they're -- they have drawn this vertical appointment language.
Well, first of all, it first appears in their reply brief.
In their opening brief, they said that that rule -- well, they didn't mention the default rule at all. They suggested it was just the executive branch. And then, in our response, we pointed out, well, actually, there's a bunch of cases from the judicial branch applying this rule. And now they've invented this kind of vertical rule. But that rule appears nowhere in the Court's cases.
The Court has said, in context after context, that the removal power is ""inherent in."" It just comes along with the appointment power.
You said it in constitutional cases, statutory cases, high-level officials, low-level officials, judicial branch, executive branch. And even if you hadn't said that over and over again, if you look at the history, here, the history shows that states could remove electors from the very beginning, again, from -- the statutes from before 1800.
And -- and -- and so -- and the other side's theory on this front also is that -- is that once the State appoints the elector, they somehow become part of another branch of government or -- or something like that. But -- but the Court has rejected that idea.
The Court has said that these -- these electors are not federal agents or officials. The Court said that very clearly in Fitzgerald over a century ago. So -- so their -- their -- their new-found theory about so-called horizontal appointments, it's just not supported by text, by history, or by precedent.
And -- and -- and it's kind of a side show, frankly.
It's just not -- it's not -- it doesn't help answer the question here.
The Court has never drawn that distinction. But there is a -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? General, what do you view as your best textual argument? Well, Your Honor, we think the best textual argument is just that nothing in the Constitution limits state authority over how to appoint electors or what -- or whether states can impose conditions and enforce them. We think there's a direct grant of authority in the appointment power, as -- as this Court has repeatedly recognized.
And we think that, certainly, by the time of the Twelfth Amendment, everyone understood that electors were being chosen in the states because they had promised to support particular candidates. So the idea that when the -- when the framers of that amendment used the word ""elector,"" they inherently meant someone who can exercise discretion is just -- it just doesn't make any sense.
That is not how the term was being applied in any of the states.
That was not how they understood it. And, in fact, the Framers of the Twelfth Amendment quite clearly intended to -- to -- to embrace the system as it had developed, where electors were pledging their votes and states were choosing them on that basis.
This Court said that in Ray very clearly.
That was a key point of the Twelfth Amendment.
So -- If I -- if I understand you correctly, you're really saying you don't have an affirmative textual argument. What your -- what your argument is, is that the Constitution doesn't say and in -- in -- in that -- if the Constitution doesn't say, we should presume that states were meant to decide? Well, let me be more precise, Justice Kagan.
I don't -- I think we -- that -- that -- that starting principle is right, that we -- that it should be the other side's burden to show that we can't do this. But -- but the power to appoint does include the power to remove, and so there is a textual grant. And what I was getting at at the end there was just that the central premise of the other side's argument is that these words, ""elector"" -- especially ""elector"" -- require the exercise of discretion.
And that's not true as a textual matter, and it's absolutely not true as a historical matter. And so that's, I guess, the -- the point that I was trying to get at there, was that it's their argument, really, that asks you to ignore the original understanding and early practice, and they're asking you to do that based on words that -- meanings of these words that just are not how the framers and their contemporaries understood them. Isn't the idea that the power to appoint includes the power to remove highly contextual, that it depends on a certain understanding of control, which is exactly the question here? It does -- you're sort of assuming the conclusion by saying that. I disagree, Your Honor. The Court has said repeatedly that the power to appoint includes the power to remove, unless there is text limiting that power.
And the power -- and that limitations on the power, the Court has said, will not be implied. And, again, the Court has said that in many, many, many contexts.
And really the only time the Court has found otherwise is where there was explicit text limiting the removal power.
And so I don't -- you know, I don't want to -- I don't want to overly emphasize this point.
I think it's at least as important that when you look at the early understanding, the framers and their contemporaries clearly understood that states could remove and replace electors, and they also clearly understood that states could choose electors because of who they had pledged to support. So, you know, I think -- I think it's the other side that really is asking you to rip these words out of context and place vastly more weight on them, on -- on these kind of dictionary definitions untethered from how the framers actually applied them. You know, they're -- they're -- they're asking you to adopt kind of one possible reading that the framers could have had of these terms, but it's a possible reading that is just refuted by what the framers and their contemporaries actually did. And it also, Your -- Your Honor, Justice Kagan, it leads to the absurd consequence that -- that everything that we think of as the presidential election process currently is really just advisory.
It is all largely irrelevant.
It just -- it just -- you know, all that matters is who the electors choose.
And on the other side's telling, they can choose whoever they want for whatever reason they want and they can't be removed even if they're taking a bribe or even if they're being blackmailed or even if they say in advance, I'm not going to show up for the meeting. It -- it just -- again, it would radically change how American presidential elections have always worked in our country. Thank you, General. Justice -- Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I understand your argument is that a thousand dollar fine doesn't diminish or negate the fact that the elector here is voting and has in some real sense a right to vote and it -- it's being honored. But what about the new law that both Washington's adopted and I know Colorado has too, the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act, and I know you're going to tell me it's not before us, but put that aside for the moment if you will for purposes of this question, that as I understand it, and you can correct me, that if a -- a -- an elector renders a faithless vote, that automatically removes him from office as a matter of law, and, in fact, votes aren't even counted until the Secretary of State has collected the requisite number of ballots, marked for the right people, based on preexisting pledges. Is that consistent with the Constitution's prescribed order of appointment, meaning in voting, it seems like the voting comes first and then the appointment under the uniform law, and is it also consistent with the federal Electoral Count Act? If -- if -- if you could just speak to me about those questions, I'd be grateful. Certainly, Justice Gorsuch.
It -- it is consistent because the way that the laws work is that the elector who seeks to violate the conditions of their appointment by casting a faithless ballot is removed before they can vote.
They're not removed before they're appointed.
They are initially appointed.
But then they're removed when they violate the condition. And -- and then they're replaced and another elector is appointed who will follow the law that they promised to -- to follow and -- and keep their promise and vote as directed.
So the order is -- is -- is proper.
It's -- it's appointment.
It -- it -- and, you know, depending when in the process the elector announces their intentions, they're removed and they're replaced by someone else who votes in accordance with state law. And to come back to my example from earlier if I can, there's really no meaningful difference between the person who says, I don't like our nominee, I'm not showing up for the meeting, and one who says, I don't like our nominee, I'm showing up for the meeting and I'm voting for somebody else. The State -- both -- both people have violated valid conditions of appointment, both people can be removed by the State and replaced by someone else. The other side's position is neither of those people can be replaced.
And -- and -- and even the person who says, I'm not showing up because, you know, somebody gave me two million dollars to not show up because that might affect the outcome of the election, the other side says that person can't be replaced.
That just makes absolutely no sense historically, textually, or practically. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, General Purcell.
If you're right about the electors not having this kind of discretion from the Constitution, I wanted to get your take on a provision of Article II, Section 1 that says, no senator or representative or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector. What is the purpose you see of that provision if your theory of the electors is correct? Yes, Justice Kavanaugh. Thank you for that question. So the framers did not spend a whole lot of time talking about the exact role of electors, and they certainly did not agree on exactly what role they would play, but one thing that they were clear on was they did not want Congress choosing the President. And so they specifically prohibited members of Congress from serving in that role. But other -- but they left it to states to decide whether electors would serve as kind of -- you know, as Hamilton envisioned them, as the kind of sage chooser on behalf of the states or, as many other framers wanted, the electors to be agents of the people, to -- to -- to act on the people's behalf and for the people to choose them and for them to be bound to that outcome, to be bound to the people's preference. So -- so, yes, they imposed that limited limitation on who could serve, and -- and that is, you know, another example of a constitutional condition limiting states' authority.
But, again, it just goes to the point that if -- if the state can set a condition to serve as an elector, that condition can be enforced. Mr. Lessig says that the framers considered various modes, obviously, and you agree and history shows they considered the states doing it directly, or at least that was an idea out there through the legislatures or governors.
They considered Congress, as you just pointed out, but there was a separation of powers there, problem there. They didn't necessarily want the new President to be too dependent on Congress.
A popular election was -- was not adopted. And so they came up instead with what Mr. Lessig describes as a indirect mode of selection with the model of electors who would exercise, as he sees it, their own discretion and independent judgment to pick the best person to be President, the best person to head the executive branch. And he says that mode remains indirect, consistent with the framers' choice, only if the electors retain a legal discretion. So, on that overall structure that Mr. Lessig sets up and describes the history, why is he not right, given that they rejected all these other modes? Your Honor, the number -- the framers had a number of concerns about direct elections that included logistical concerns and concerns about the impact on the influence of southern states, but, ultimately, they settled on an approach that left it to the states to decide, as this Court said in McPherson, the broadest possible power of determination as to how to appoint electors and what role they would play. And -- and the -- the options open to states certainly included both leaving electors with discretion, as some states still do today, and states choosing electors specifically because they have pledged to support a particular candidate.
And, certainly, by the time of the Twelfth Amendment, that had become the virtually universal practice in states. And the framers of the Twelfth Amendment well understood that and -- and adopted the -- the language of the Twelfth Amendment to facilitate that.
And if you need a historical example, if that would be helpful, in -- in the election of 1804, right after adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, it -- it operated just as they had expected.
The parties put forward presidential and vice presidential tickets, electors were chosen throughout the country because they supported those tickets, and every single elector in the country voted for the party ticket preferred by their state's voters. And -- and the meetings of the electors, even in 1804, were in many states mere formalities.
They -- they filled out pre-prepared ballots.
They did not discuss or deliberate.
And Congress did not question a single one of those ballots or their validity. So that just shows that by the time of the Twelfth Amendment, as this Court has said repeatedly, the role of electors was simply to transmit the vote of the state for President. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
Would you like to take a minute to wrap up? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief -- Yes, I would. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Every four years, over 100 million Americans participate in our country's presidential election process.
They attend rallies, they watch debates, and, ultimately, they go to the polls. More Americans participate in this election than in any other democratic process in our system of government.
But, under Petitioners' theory, this entire process is irrelevant and always has been because all that matters is who the electors prefer. On their view, the electors can choose whoever they want to be President, regardless of any voluntary commitments they made to secure their position, regardless of how their state voted, and regardless of whether they are being bribed or blackmailed for their vote. That is not the law.
The Constitution's text, the original understanding, this Court's precedent, and our country's historical practice all demonstrate that states are allowed to require presidential electors to vote for the candidate chosen by the state's voters and to enforce that requirement. We ask you to reaffirm that principle today. Thank you. Thank you, General. Mr. Lessig, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Your -- Your Honors, the State has relied upon early statutes which it says affirm the power of the state to remove electors because they violate a condition.
Absolutely none of those statutes have anything to do with the conditions on voting. Those statutes related to the appointment power.
They were incidental to the appointment power.
So you can see obviously that, incidental to the appointment power, the State has the authority to make sure someone -- someone shows up to vote.
And we believe that general laws apply to electors as well.
This is not a general immunity.
But they have no power to control the vote and they never have exercised that. The State has asserted that because they appoint the electors, they get to control the electors.
But, in fact, the authority they rely on is quite explicit.
Myers, at page 119, says the reason for this is that those in charge of and responsible for administering functions of government need the authority to control them by removing them.
That was the reason for the principle. But there is nothing in the founding to suggest that the framers imagined the states administering the Electoral College.
That's why the states don't appear in the Twelfth Amendment at all. And, finally, Your Honor, if you recognize this power, how do you cabin it? If you find the State has the power to regulate electoral votes, may the State forbid the elector from voting for a candidate who has not visited the state, who has not released his tax returns, as bills in New Jersey and New York purport to do, or has not pledged to appoint justices who will uphold Roe? Open this door and there are an endless list of partisan opportunisms that will tempt the states.
Throughout history, there have been amendments to change the elector discretion, every single time recognizing there was that discretion. For the State of Washington, in 1977, to discover it is to show they were chumps believing they didn't have this power.
And we believe the power has always been with electors to exercise discretion. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-565, CITGO Asphalt Refining Company versus Frescati Shipping Company. Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The basic issue in this case is what ought to be the default rule for what is the generally referred to as safe-port or safe-berth clause in the standard charter party form that has, frankly, governed the transportation of ocean-going vessels for a very, very long time. There are -- the court below concluded that -- based on the language referring specifically to ""staying afloat and safely,"" that this imposed a strict liability on the charterer, my client, who designated that Paulsboro, New Jersey, would be the port of entry for these particular goods. That is an extraordinary interpretation under the circumstances in which my client is now facing well in excess of $140 million in -- in -- in an award based solely on an accident that was, candidly, unknown and unknowable at the time that the designation was made and, candidly, at any time until the actual allision occurred. The question then is, is there a different or better or more sensible default rule that the Court might turn to? And it seems worth spending a second and just focusing on the exact language of this clause, which is at the appendix to the Petitioners' brief at 8a. ""The vessel shall discharge at any safe place or wharf"" -- that, of course, says nothing about any obligations of any of the parties -- ""which shall be designated and procured by the charterer"" -- so that is the obligation of my client to designate and -- and procure the space -- ""provided that the vessel can proceed thereto, lie at, and depart therefrom always safely afloat, any lighterage being at the expense, risk, and peril of the charterer."" And it seems to me the difficulty with saying that this is an unlimited source of liability on a strict liability theory is that why would you identify lighterage as the specific remedy to be worried about unless what you're really concerned about is, has the charterer made essentially a safe choice as far as everyone can tell, and then, when the captain gets there, if for whatever reason the captain in his or her judgment decides it's not a safe choice and decides to go off into another port or to offload some portion at the expense and the risk, all of that is then imposed upon the charterer. Mr. Phillips, this has been the rule for some time in the Seventh Circuit -- in the Second Circuit -- Second Circuit. -- including an opinion by Henry Friendly.
And isn't this something that the parties can adjust to? If they know what the rule is, they can adjust to it and insure accordingly? That's -- that is precisely what the Court said about Norfolk Southern versus James Kirby in terms of how do you interpret the contract.
Obviously, it will always be possible to write around whatever the contract interpretation has to be, but the Court still has the fundamental obligation to determine what should be the default rule. And while it is true that there was -- that there's certainly been a period of time when the Second Circuit adopted a -- a broader construction of this clause, it is equally true that for almost 30 years, the Fifth Circuit has adopted precisely the opposite construction of this clause, and Gilmore and Black for more than 40 years, 50 years, have adopted a fundamentally different -- Contrary to -- to the -- to the -- -- construction of this clause. -- to the other treatises.
But there is another clause that is adopted in some charter parties, and it's called -- what is it called -- the due diligence clause. So, if that clause, that clause would be unnecessary under your reading because you say that's all that the safe-berth clause required.
So all of these charters that have been adopting the specific language of due diligence, they're doing -- they've done something that's entirely unnecessary? The -- the difficulty, I think, with looking at other forms and other clauses and other contracts between other parties is -- is, candidly, there's no evidence that ties any knowledge of any of that to the decision that was made between the Star Tanker and my client when they entered into the -- into the charter party arrangement in this particular case. It's true that there were other options available, but the question is, what did the parties intend when they chose this language under these circumstances? And against the backdrop -- because I -- I do think the text itself tells you that the basic problem this is designed to deal with is what do you do when you show a -- when you pick a place that's safe, it turns out it's not safe, and then the -- then the captain has to act in response to that, what's the -- what's the outcome? But, if you put it contextually and look at other provisions of this contract, where you have the general exceptions clause that says that the -- that there -- that for perils of the sea, neither the charterer, nor the owner of the ship, nor anybody else is responsible for those kinds of injuries. And so that suggests to you that for what we're looking at, unknown and unknowable hazards, that that's -- that that's not what the parties expected would be imposed on the charterer by simply designating at the time a safe port. Second -- Mr. Phillips, even if we're looking just to this contract, these parties, you said, well, look, there is the Second Circuit, but we have the Fifth Circuit on our side.
But this contract actually seems pretty well oriented to the Second Circuit. So there's a arbitration provision in the contract which says that any and all differences in disputes of whatever nature shall be put to arbitration in the city of New York or in the city of London. And then there's another provision in the contract, a jurisdiction clause, which says that disputes concerning non-delivery or damage to cargo may be submitted for adjudication to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. So every time that this contract says something about where it expects disputes to go, it points to New York. Well, but those are -- but those are choice-of-forum clauses.
They're not choice-of-law clauses.
They don't say specifically that we intend -- Well, we know what happens -- -- for the Second Circuit rule. -- we know what happens in arbitration in New York.
Arbitrators -- arbitrators in New York follow the Second Circuit rule. They tend to follow the -- And certainly -- -- Second Circuit rule, although the -- -- certainly, the Southern District of New York is following the Second Circuit rule, isn't it? To be sure.
But the -- but the -- but the flip side of that, first of all, this wasn't litigated in -- in New York. This was litigated in the Third Circuit -- Well, I know -- -- and properly so. -- there was some strange circumstance, you know, it didn't -- didn't end up going to arbitration.
But mostly people expect that these kinds of disputes will go to arbitration. And this arbitration clause says you're in New York or you're in London, both of which have a warranty interpretation of this safe-berth clause. Right. So even if we're just looking to this particular contract between these two parties, I -- I guess I'm thinking these two parties thought that this was going to be adjudicated in New York -- But -- -- under New York rules. -- but even under -- even under that interpretation, which I don't think is a fair way to interpret this, because it seems to me that when you're engaged in a very broad contract entry position, to say that this was -- that this was something that was entertained because they knew how New York law worked in certain ways, I don't think is a fair way to interpret the contract. But I -- but -- but even aside from that, if you actually look at the arbitration decisions that our friends cite and -- and examine them, they say things like, of course, the charterer is not the insurer against all risk that takes place.
So there's at least some reason to doubt that the rule would ever be interpreted as broadly as it is in this context. And to me -- and -- and so -- and that there are others in which the court has said that strict liability doesn't extend to the ends of the earth.
So there -- there are -- it's -- it's -- it's far from clear what that would mean. But what we do know is that the provision specifically says U.S. law.
And U.S. law, obviously, at this stage, ought to be what this Court decides it ought to be. And, again, remember, this is not an agreement between my friends over here and my client.
This is an agreement between a third-party and my client.
And there is no evidence as to what either -- either of them had in mind with respect to this particular issue. So I think what you should look at is the language and the text and what does that lead you to, what's the conclusion to take from that, the context that tells you the general exceptions that we're not liable for perils of the sea, nor is anybody else liable.
That's what insurance -- Well, can I just -- -- ought to be for. -- can I just ask, Mr. Phillips, about the text, because the text does say a safe berth, yeah? Yes, Your Honor, safe -- safe place. Safe place or wharf, right, safe place or wharf.
I mean, just thinking about that as, you know, under Black Letter rules of contract, which -- which suggests that material statements of fact are, indeed, warranties, I mean, what would be the difference if I said to you, I'm going to sell you a working car for $1,000 and then I give you the car and it breaks down two minutes later? I mean, would you -- would you think that that's anything other than a warranty? No, I would think that that is, in -- in fact, a warranty, but I think that -- Even though, like I -- I said, I didn't know that this car was ready to break down.
It's unknown and unknowable.
I had no -- I had no idea. Well, my guess is, first of all, I mean, I hate to -- to fight your hypothetical, but my guess is that's -- that's something that is at least potentially knowable, although I -- I can envision a circumstance where it wouldn't be. Here, you're talking about something that is absolutely unknown and unknowable under these particular circumstances.
And -- and -- Well, absolutely -- -- the term ""safe"" -- -- I mean, there are ways of -- -- doesn't mean as against all possible risk. Aren't there -- It doesn't have to mean that.
It can just mean safe for the ordinary use that you're going to put it to, as the -- as the Ocean Victory decision in the U.K. says, which I think is the best way to think about this: Was it safe for that vessel on that day at that place, given what we knew about the characteristics -- What if -- Well, Mister -- -- of the port. -- what if we think the text can be read your way, but it can also be read the other way? What should we do then? Then you should go to the other criteria, which is the context, which I've already identified, and the billion dollars of liability insurance that the other side has. I think the case law tends to support us more.
I think Atkins can be read as having rejected exactly the kind of warranty, because there the situation was that the -- one of the parties said to the ship's captain it's a safe port, and the Court rejected the idea that that was a warranty on its face that you could get in under any circumstances and regardless of knowledge. Then I think you look at the other two criteria that the Court uses in deciding the right way to interpret admiralty con -- contracts in admiralty. One is, is it -- is the -- you know, does this promote maritime commerce? And the -- the answer to that seems to me clearly not. We know from the amicus briefs that operate in the Fifth Circuit, those merchants don't routinely get -- get insurance and don't -- can't get insurance for a lot of what we're talking about here.
And it would completely disrupt all of the commerce that goes into the Gulf under these circumstances. Well, if we get to custom and usage, which is what you seem to be talking about, can that be decided on the record that we have? Isn't that a factual question? And was that fact decided by the district court? No -- well, it wasn't decided by the district court because the court of appeals in its prior opinion had basically said this is a strict liability to the limits of the earth holding, and, therefore, there was no opportunity for the district court to entertain that. On the other hand, what we -- what we do know in terms of transactional costs and insurance I think is probably knowable from common sense.
I don't know that it's necessarily a triable fact. I mean, this Court has in the past examined whether or not a particular rule is going to adversely affect maritime commerce. And it seems to me that any rule that exposes a defendant to limitless liability interferes with maritime commerce and efficient maritime commerce. Well, along those lines, Mr. Phillips, I'm trying to -- I'm trying to figure out the difference between your rule and -- and your colleague's suggested rule. As I understand it, you would like us to essentially impose a negligence standard, a due diligence standard.
We -- we couldn't have known that the anchor was there in the river when we hit it and, therefore, we shouldn't be liable. The other side says, no, there's a warranty of safe berth, but at least as it's been interpreted by many courts, including the English court you -- you -- you alluded to earlier, there's an exception for abnormal circumstances under -- under the particular circumstances.
I think you alluded to it as well in these circumstances at this time and this place. It seems to me that those two rules, strict liability minus abnormal circumstances and negligence, are awfully close at the end of the day.
And if that -- is that true, first of all? Would you agree with that? And isn't your real problem at least the argument from the other side that you didn't make an abnormal circumstances argument below and so that you are stuck with more of a strict liability result in this case but might not have been on a different record in different circumstances? The -- the answer to your question, Justice Gorsuch, is that we did make an abnormal occurrence argument.
And if you look at the reply brief in our footnote, we devote, you know, an entire -- Yeah. -- footnote to the six times that we referred to abnormal circumstances. And, again, put it in the context of the litigation, which is the district court had held that we were not liable under these circumstances.
And the court of appeals says, well, we're just going to decide some legal issues here and sort of -- and now you lose on that legal issue. So the opportunity to try to parse out the nuance of what you've just described wasn't available to us, but we certainly posed at -- Okay. -- at every stage that argument.
So if you wanted to remand -- Yeah. -- for that issue, that would -- you know, if you vacate the -- the -- the decision and send it back to is this a peril of the sea or is this a natural occurrence -- I got you.
I got you, Mr. Phillips.
I guess let's -- let's get away from the specifics of this case, though I know they're very near and dear to you and your client. What's the difference between those two legal rules, if any? The due diligence standard, frankly, doesn't go to the question, to my mind, to the question of this particular obstruction. The due diligence goes to the question of whether you -- whether you did due diligence in selecting the port or the berth in the first instance.
And that's usually regulated on the basis of the -- the history of the port. And -- and, again, if you look at the original district court opinion that talks about the 147 ships just like this one that pass through exactly that stretch, there's no question this was a safe port when selected under those circumstances. Mr. Phillips, you -- And we did our due diligence there. -- you've been using terms like strict liability and due diligence, and those -- those sound in tort to me, and yet we're dealing with a contract. The contract doesn't say anything like that -- any familiar tort terms.
It just says you're going to provide a safe place.
And you either did or you didn't, but that's a matter of contract. I don't know.
It -- it seems to be introducing -- you seem to be introducing these tort concepts into a contract case. I'm not sure I'm the one who's introduced them into the -- into the contract case, other than I think the lower courts, frankly, are the ones who've decided that the better way to conceptualize the problem is in -- is in these terms. You know, from my perspective, I'm perfectly comfortable if the question is, is this a safe port, there was no breach of the contract.
This, of course, was a safe port. Ships had gone in and out of there for years and years and years.
And what we faced was an unknown and unknowable obstacle that caused this particular allision. So the question that Justice Gorsuch -- to go back to Justice Gorsuch's question, what do you do in that circumstance, is you -- is you say who should be liable under -- Well, but it's not -- -- in that -- -- it's not a safe port.
What made it unsafe, as you say, was something that was unknown and unknowable, but it's still a question of contract law. Right.
But the question is, did the parties envision that for something that was unknown and unknowable, that one of the parties would -- that that made it unsafe under those circumstances? Or isn't the more logical conclusion to draw, particularly in the context of a provision that says that there is no responsibility and -- and does it in terms of damages for losses that are -- that are caused by perils of the sea? Under the contract, and separating out tort law and contract law, under tort law, it happens because there is an accident.
In its classic terms, it's unknown and unknowable. Right. Under contract law, why should the vessel bear the risk of someone else's choice? Because of the unknown and unknowable? The voyage is -- the vessel is there only because of the charterer's choice, not because of its own. Right. And so, if we're talking in terms of contract, why does that make any sense to view it in any other way than to say the charterer picks, the charterer has the expense, risk, and peril of lighterage -- and lighterage, in my mind, can include all the charges related to the transfer to a safe berth. There was no ability to do that.
It just was destroyed there. So I -- I'm -- I'm just not quite sure you're -- you were answering the Chief's question. Well, I -- I -- Which is -- Right. -- if you're talking about the parties' expectations, why would the vessel think it should be responsible for losses occasioned by someone else's choice? Because all that the choice imposed as a -- as an obligation on my client was to identify someplace that is safe in the sense that it -- there are no obvious risks, that it is not obviously un- -- I don't see -- -- inappropriate. -- those words anywhere in the contract. Well, that -- they only make sense in the context of what is the remedy by choosing poorly.
It's not as -- as you would get in dealing with the general exceptions clause, which says they would be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from the perils of the sea. If you were going to say that you are responsible for everything, you would use precisely that same language.
And if you depart from there, then you are responsible for any loss or damages arising from the choice made by the -- by the charterer.
The fact that they don't use that language suggests that this is a much narrower obligation. And the reason why you would interpret it in light of that is -- again, goes back to the core notions of maritime commerce, that any time you begin to impose virtually limitless liability on a party who has no ability to make a choice, and you do so in a way that we know from our amicus will dash the expectations of a very large part of the economy that operates in the Gulf of Mexico, this Court ought to think long and hard about whether that's the more sensible rule and adopt the more -- the more restrained rule and realize at the end of the day, the reason why the -- the -- the ship owner would expect this liability to be on it is twofold. One, it took out insurance.
It has a billion dollars of insurance against the ultimate liability here.
And, two, it almost certainly had insurance for its hull. And that's -- that is exactly the position that -- that Gilmore and Black explained many, many years ago as to the why -- as to the reason why it's not reasonable to expect that the ship owner thinks he's getting a pass on this circumstance.
And it is certainly not reasonable to think that the charterer under these circumstances would assume that kind of liability. Back to the text, it does say ""safe place or wharf which shall be designated and procured by the charterer."" So the words ""designated and procured"" are not just the place but the fact that it's safe as well. So, if it turns out not to be safe, just as a matter of logic, it hasn't designated or procured a safe place or wharf. Well, the question -- it seems to me the question, Justice Kavanaugh, really is, does safe mean that you -- you -- that you will assure that regardless of what happens, if it -- if it gets hit by a meteor, if it gets -- if somebody, a vandal, goes on the -- on the ship while it's in a berth and blows it up, that that's all on the charterer? Did the charterer assume all of those obligations? Well, it says designated or procured, and procured a safe place.
And it doesn't say usually safe place. So, if it turns out not to be safe, then -- I mean, I do think that's one interpretation you can give to it. The other interpretation, which is much more sensible in -- in terms of maritime commerce and the rest of the provisions and the other protections that the other parties have against this particular liability, is -- is to say it's safe in the way the U.K. Supreme Court said. It's safe for this ship under these circumstances on that particular day as a prediction made at the time that the prediction is made. So -- And there's no question we satisfied that standard under these circumstances.
We knew -- and the record's very clear about this in 342, 343 of the -- of the appendix to the petition -- hundreds of ships of the same size and dimensions of this one had passed right there, right through there -- So -- -- completely safe. -- Mr. Phillips, what you're saying is sensible seems to be doing a lot of the work there, in contrast to the language that Justice Kavanaugh read. And, again, this goes back to the question of what you're supposed to do in tort and what you're supposed to do in contract.
I always thought that the contract rule is that you view as sensible whatever the parties chose, that there is not -- you know, courts are not here to decide what's sensible or what's efficient.
If the parties chose something, that's by definition sensible and efficient. I don't -- I mean, obviously, in the abstract, I don't -- I don't disagree with that proposition.
The question is, was this language meant to carry as much water as -- as the -- as the other side would ask it to carry? And, again, I would go back to the other language, the exceptions clause. Well -- -- which talks about unless otherwise in this charter expressly exempted, they shall not be responsible for any loss arising out of the peril of the sea.
It doesn't seem to me under those circumstances that this -- that -- that the provision on the safe berth envisions that we are taking on the responsibility for everything that can happen that would be a peril of the sea or that would be an abnormal occurrence. I would say that the Court ought to draw that line.
And whether it draws that line as a matter of due diligence in tort concepts or whether it draws that line as the better way to read this particular contract, I'm perfectly comfortable with that. And even if the Court thinks that there ought to be a remand to determine whether this was an abnormal occurrence or whether this was a peril of the sea, that would be fine too, because the answer to the question is this is clearly a peril of the sea.
The Supreme Court -- this Court said as much in G.R. Booth already. And -- and is this an abnormal occurrence? The idea of a ten-ton anchor that leaps -- floops up, catches my -- my -- my -- this ship, floops down again, that is not only an abnormal occurrence -- and this is a bad pun -- but that is maybe the flukiest outcome imaginable. (Laughter.) I knew I'd get somebody.
If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The sophisticated commercial parties in this case chose a form contract to govern the transport of oil from Venezuela to Petitioners' berth on the Delaware River.
When the parties entered their agreement in 2004, they had the choice of two types of safe-berth clauses that predominate within the industry. As this Court's already recognized this morning, some contracts include a traditional safe-berth clause, which gives the charterer the right to designate the port but requires that the charterer choose a port that is safe.
In stark contrast, other contrasts -- other contracts include a more limited clause, which expressly provides that the charterer will not be liable so long as it exercises due diligence in selecting the port or expressly disclaims a warranty of safety. The parties here chose the first traditional type of clause, which lacks any due diligence language.
By the time they had done so, courts, arbitrators, and scholars on both sides of the Atlantic had for decades construed the safe-berth clause as a warranty that the charterer would choose a port that is actually safe, not merely one that the charterer believes to be safe after the exercise of due diligence. Ms. Ross, I'm -- I'm going to pose to you the same sort of question I posed to Mr. Phillips, which is I'm not sure what the difference or delta is between the two proposed tests at the end of the day. Yes, this is a contract case, but Mr. Phillips has argued for something like a due diligence, right? I think of it as really a negligence-type standard. You've argued for something more like strict liability, right, that it's a warranty, absolute.
But you've also recognized, at least in passing, that there's an exception to that warranty for abnormal circumstances, whatever that is.
Nobody knows what that is. At the end of the day, don't the two wind up in pretty much the same place? And if they do, my question for you is, given the difficulty of knowing what an abnormal circumstance is and how atextual that would be in this contract, which speaks only of a guarantee of safe berth, why shouldn't we adopt the Petitioners' position as more administrable at least? So, Justice Gorsuch, I disagree that they wind up in the same place.
I also disagree that Petitioners have preserved an abnormal occurrence argument. And I think it's very important here, Your Honor used the phrase ""abnormal characteristic."" It's actually an abnormal occurrence under that -- well, it matters because the way that ""abnormal occurrence"" is defined in the English cases, which have done the bulk of the work in this area, is it is something from outside the port.
It is not a prevailing characteristic of the port.
It's something from outside the port that comes in and causes an abnormal event. And it's not the accident itself that has to be abnormal.
It's that cause of the accident that has to be abnormal. Like -- like what? So, for example, there's an old -- so Mr. Phillips mentioned a meteor.
I think that's exactly the example that the Sir Bernard Eder amicus brief gives.
That's -- he's a well-known English judge and scholar on this topic.
So that might be an example. There's an English case called the EVIEFF from the 1980s where, when the parties selected the port, everything was well and good, everything was fine.
It turns out the Iran/Iraq war breaks out and the ship gets stuck in the port. That has nothing to do with the characteristics of the port.
It's an entirely external -- Well, the -- -- event that causes -- -- U.K. Supreme Court has recently just held, though, that a big storm that sweeps into the port also counts as an abnormal occurrence, if you want, though that surely -- those types of storms have not been unknown to that port in the past.
They're rare, but they happen. So whether or not the abnormal occurrence situation applies here, again, given the difficulty of knowing what that is and the fact that we might have to just more or less make that up as we go, why isn't Mr. Phillips' test more reasonable? So I think the fact, Your Honor, I -- I agree that a large weather event could be an abnormal occurrence.
I don't think that that actually changes that the abnormal occurrence doctrine doesn't apply here. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Petitioners didn't preserve this argument below when they used abnormal occurrence.
They were saying something very different in the context. But, nonetheless, there is evidence in the record that debris of this sort on the floor of the Delaware River is not anywhere near abnormal, given the fact that it's an industrial river. I know you're -- you're liking to focus on the facts of the case just as much as Mr. Phillips, and for that I admire you.
But, if we could just back up, move up one level of generality for me. Sure. Okay.
The two legal rules.
You're the judge.
You have to pick between these two legal rules. Again, why not Mr. Phillips' on at least administrability grounds? So, I mean, I will -- I'm happy to get to administrability grounds, but I think the number one reason would be that's not what the text of the contract says and it's not -- But the text of the contract also doesn't have abnormal occurrence in it, right? Well -- So you're -- you're arguing for an atextual position yourself, I think.
And if we're -- if -- if that's where we're at, then, last shot.
Last shot. Sure. Are you -- are you arguing for that position, Ms. Ross? So -- so we're not saying that the abnormal occurrence possibility does not exist, but I don't think it's atextual. And if the Court will just bear with me, I think that is one example of a -- a set of doctrines that have grown up around this clause that show that this clause has a long lineage, but also are just sort of applications of causation principles. If there is an abnormal occurrence, Petitioners' failure to designate a safe berth is not the cause of the vessel's injury. Now that is also true of the bad navigation and seamanship doctrine.
It's also true of the waiver type named port exception doctrine that came up in -- in the district court's decision in Atkins. Now, putting all that to one side, to get back to Justice Gorsuch's administrability question, I do think that this is quite administrable.
And the way that we know that is that this has been the rule in the vast majority of jurisdictions for -- dating back to England, 1861. Ogden versus Graham, the first case anyone can find on a safe-berth clause, actually involves a situation in which the court says it is possible that the charterers were perfectly innocent as to this danger and they are still liable. So we know that it's administrable because parties have continued to choose this contract for 150 years since that decision. Now, going to another point on administrability, my friend pointed out that the law has changed in the Fifth Circuit for the last 30 years. That, too, we think is insufficient to change the weight of authority here.
And that's because, again, we have one Fifth Circuit decision against 150 years of English law, cases from the Second Circuit, including Judge Friendly's opinion in Paragon Oil -- Well -- -- beginning in the 1930s. -- the Association of Ship Brokers and Agents publishes the -- the form on which this contract was based, doesn't -- doesn't it? It does, Your Honor. And which interpretation does it think is the correct one? So it has not taken a position in this case.
At the cert stage, it simply asked the Court to grant and didn't say which side. I think it does, however, take a position sort of without taking a position by having a separate form contract that was promulgated in 1984, so six years before the Fifth Circuit's decision in Orduna and 20 years before the parties here contracted.
That's known as the ASBA II.
And that -- Well, I think it's done more than not take a position.
It says it would be entirely rational to construe a safe-berth clause to impose an absolute warranty. It also would be entirely rational to construe a safe-berth clause to impose only a due diligence obligation. So, if it doesn't know which is the right interpretation of this clause, which it is offering to the public, how can -- how can you say that it's clear? So I think it's clear for the same reason that Judge Friendly said it was clear in Paragon Oil.
As he said, a simple set of propositions was sufficient to resolve the case.
A safe berth was warranted.
It was not provided.
Therefore, the warrantor is liable. I think the language actually is quite clear.
But, even if you disagreed with me on that, I think you would look to other contracts. I think it's simply implausible that a sophisticated commercial entity like CITGO didn't know that there were other contracts, including one from the ASBA itself, promulgated again in 1984, that -- But there is -- -- expressly explains the warranty. -- a lot of authority both ways on this -- on this issue, is there not? There is not, Justice Alito.
I really would resist that impulse. Well, there's the -- there's the Gilmore and Black treatise, which is we have long regarded as one of the leading, if not the leading, admiralty treatise.
Isn't that correct? So that's correct, Your Honor.
But what Gilmore and Black actually says, and it's important to note that Gilmore and Black are writing in 1975, but what they say is that, at that time, there were many authorities that construed this as a warranty. So they're not debating what the state of the law was. They're simply saying on policy grounds that they disagree with that.
And they, like my friend, say that, in fact, you should require very clear language to have a safe-berth clause that actually functions as a warranty. But there's no basis for that in contract law, as I believe Justice Kagan was pointing out earlier.
There's no basis for that.
They don't purport to provide any basis for that either in the language of the contract or in background principles. You -- you mentioned some time ago that it's not abnormal to have debris in the Delaware River.
It's the Delaware River, right? Yes, Your Honor. Is that what we look at, or do we look at the actual event, which is, you know, the anchor leaps up from the bottom, you know, damages the hull, then returns to the bottom? I mean, that -- that -- that's a pretty abnormal occurrence, even if there are a lot of anchors. So it's possible, Your Honor, that some court might, with actual evidence about that question, decide that that is an abnormal occurrence.
I don't think that's correct. I think you would look at the presence of large debris on the floor of the river.
And one question you would have to ask is, even without the leaping up, so to speak, how much of that debris sits that high above the river? And all of this -- or the river bed. All of this goes to the fact that, as I was saying earlier, there's no evidence on this question because Petitioners did not raise it. You -- This case has gone through two trials with a total of 71 days of testimony. I think the idea that at this point Petitioners would come in and raise, in their reply brief no less, this idea of an abnormal occurrence and then this Court would remand would be quite surprising. You earlier mentioned causation principles.
Can you tell us how you would phrase the causation principle that applies to these circumstances? To the abnormal occurrence? Uh-huh. So, Justice Kavanaugh, I mean -- A line draw -- the line of causation, is it damage caused by the condition of the port, for example? Yes.
I mean, I think, roughly speaking, that's probably correct.
It's -- the -- what Petitioners have warranted is a safe port.
They actually don't disagree, at least in their brief, with the definition of ""safe."" It's on page 19 of their brief. And that means that when they fail to provide a safe port, if the characteristics of that port have caused the damage, then they are liable. And if it's weather or a meteor, obviously, that's not the condition of the port.
I guess people could argue about the things on the floor of the Delaware River, though. Well, I think people would argue about weather just in terms of how frequent that type of a storm is and things of that nature. But putting that to one side, I don't think that you would -- again, I think based on the limited evidence we have here, and common sense, I don't think that the presence of debris on an industrial river would be in the same vein as a meteor or the outbreak of a war or something of that nature. And that is where we see -- or -- or as sort of a once-in-a-generation storm even. That is -- Do you think we can sort of take judicial notice of the fact that an anchor popping up like this in a port that is very heavily used is more foreseeable than a big storm? So, Your Honor, my suggestion, if I -- if I were to be sort of bold enough to make one, would be that the Court not address this particular question at all because Petitioners haven't preserved it. And so I think it would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to say in a different case, where Petitioners have not gone through two trials and failed to ever raise this question, it might be appropriate for a -- a -- a United States court to consider the scope of the abnormal occurrence doctrine, but that that's not this case. You -- you referred to the fact that it's the London courts that have done the work on this. Uh-huh. Have -- has the Second Circuit or any of the New York arbitrators, do they recognize this doctrine or not? So, Justice Kagan, to my knowledge, there are statements, including in the Third Circuit's opinion here, that sort of acknowledge that this safety definition includes a carveout for abnormal weather or other occurrences, is usually how it's phrased in the American cases.
I'm not aware of an American case that actually applies it or an American arbitration, for that matter, that actually applies it. The arbitration point, if I might, it just loops back to something that we were briefly discussing earlier.
The -- Mr. Phillips relies on the Fifth Circuit's decision in Orduna as sort of a sea change, so to speak. The -- I think that that's incorrect, not only because we think it's sort of too little too late and it's poorly reasoned, but also because, in following Orduna itself, Petitioners have not pointed to any case that has actually applied the rule of Orduna, nor have they pointed to any arbitration. Now they say that, well, the Maritime Arbitration Society in Houston doesn't publish its decisions.
We also are not aware of and they have not put forth a single arbitration clause that would send arbitration to the Fifth Circuit. So, if you look at the New York arbitrations, some of them, in fact, involve accidents that occurred in New Orleans, and they -- because of the standard forms that Justice Kagan was discussing earlier, they still wind up in New York arbitration.
And so we don't think -- I mean, arbitrators don't have to interpret the law the same way a court does, and to the extent they do it, it's not reviewable by a court.
So how much can we read into arbitration decisions? So, Justice Alito, I certainly take the point that arbitrators may not be bound in the same way that lower courts would be.
I think where you have a situation -- although, actually, in the Second Circuit, there is a case overturning an arbitrator's decision for failing to follow Second Circuit law and following other courts. I take the point that this Court might not agree with that decision.
But I think when you have a case like this one where you have 67 arbitrations on one side of the ledger and zero on the other, you don't actually need to decide these sort of more difficult edge cases about what would happen if it were closer or if you really had a question as to what law the arbitrators were applying. It's quite clear in these, again, reported, well-reasoned, quite predictable after, you know, the first 20 or so, arbitration decisions. I don't know.
I'd be very nervous about saying that we should interpret the law in accordance with a body of arbitral decisions, having read a fair number of arbitral decisions and seen how they treat the law. So I think, Justice Alito, the way I would phrase it, if I might, is that the -- the arbitration decisions are really confirmation of the industry's understanding because these are expert arbitrators. And, again, going back to where I started this morning, the industry had and has had, I believe since the 1950s, two sort of standard form contracts that govern.
And so it is consistent with that dichotomy between -- Excuse me. -- express due diligence -- With respect to that issue, your -- Mr. Phillips says that you can't get insurance, that a ruling in your favor will destroy the industry.
Could you address that issue? If I might. Yes. Sure.
So I don't think that's correct.
I don't think they have any evidence for that.
I think on the insurance point, two points are really important here. One is that the reason why vessel owners have that insurance is because the Oil Pollution Act requires it because they're the statutory responsible parties.
It's not specific to this contract. The second is that their amici suggest that charterers can't get insurance.
I think there's plenty of evidence in the red brief and in some of our amicus briefs that that's just not true.
So I don't think that that should be driving the decision here. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I thought I would come at this from the perspective that Justice Alito asked about. What if we regard the text as in equipoise? It says safe, and that could mean different things in different contexts.
And I'd ask the Court to just look at what the position of the parties was at the time they entered into this agreement. So, at the time that they did this, it wasn't just you had to interpret safe port. There were two different kinds of forms, and they were basically evenly divided.
This was all done by an industry that they just choose forms off the shelf, and there are a bunch that say safe port and there are a bunch that say the charterer will exercise due diligence in selecting a safe port.
And so that's a pretty meaningful choice. Then you say, okay, with respect to the ones that say safe port, what was the understanding of the industry at the time? Now every one of those forms said that any dispute will be resolved by arbitration in either New York or London.
There were none for Houston. So every single one of them said we'll go to New York or London. And you say, okay, how were these provisions interpreted in London and New York? Well, they were uniformly interpreted, the safe port provisions, as importing a warranty.
So there were 67, as my friend mentioned, from expert arbitrators in New York.
That would include four on this particular form, not just in general but this specific form. Every decision of the Second Circuit -- Justice Kagan cited a provision of the charter party, in particular, that dealt -- deals with lost cargo, so when the oil spilled out of the oil tanker into the Delaware River, that would be a lost cargo claim.
And that was, you know, in -- going to be done in the Southern District of New York. And then all of the London decisions, all of the U.K. courts, and unlike U.S. arbitrations, U.K. arbitrations do get reviewed by the courts, and there was absolute uniform authority. So, if you just ask, ah, I'm just not sure exactly how I would look at these words, I do think it's quite clear how the industry would look at these words. Then I wanted to turn, if I could, to Justice Gorsuch's question about, okay, you know, what really is the difference here? I do think the critical textual difference is between whether the injury is caused by the port or by some other thing.
Justice Kavanaugh, this is the question of causation. And so, if it is a characteristic of the port -- and I would also encourage the Court to look at the phrase ""always safely afloat."" There are two parts to this provision.
And what they're -- they cite, the authorities, they're quite right, that says ""always safely afloat"" means you're not going to hit something on the bottom.
And that's the kind of obstruction that you have with an anchor.
Whether it flips up or down, it is on the bottom.
And that is a very common thing.
It is the kind of thing that you worry about in chartering a ship. Now some -- then you ask, okay, was this a characteristic of the port or something else that caused the injury? Well, what other things might happen? You could have negligence of the ship's master.
That could be a superseding cause.
The ship's master should have been aware of an obstruction on the floor. It should have been aware of different things that were in the way, other ships and the like. Or you can have just a superseding cause that is not negligence, it is not the characteristic of the port, but it is truly some abnormal occurrence. Now this is a relatively undeveloped area of the law.
It is, though, intended to be very much the exception, not the rule.
And so it's not just a storm, but it is a 150-year storm combined with long waves.
And in that situation, the courts have said, well, maybe that isn't a condition of the port.
But we are unaware of any authority ever indicating that something that is on the floor of the port is not a characteristic of the port. You're worried about running aground. You naturally are accounting for the things that are on the bottom. Who is responsible -- who is responsible for negligence of the master? Is the master an employee of the ship's owner or is -- Yes. So -- so, if the master is negligent, then the charterer is not responsible? Yes. Then so what we have is a situation where the master is negligent and the charterer is not responsible, but where the master isn't negligent, then suddenly the charterer is responsible? It's not -- it's not suddenly.
That's what they've bargained for. It's a condition of the port. Then why would somebody do it that way? I mean, that -- that's -- Well, Justice Breyer, here's -- here's the little bit of the bait and switch if I can -- can say, and that is my friend is very concerned that someone would be held liable without fault.
And he's very concerned that $140 million might turn on this. He's not actually concerned about that.
He just wants it to be us, right? He's not saying that there shouldn't be strict liability.
He's saying it should be we are strictly liable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, well, but they still go back to the original thing.
There's a master who's hired by the owner, and he says, I'm going to take it into port X.
And he should know that port X is filled with poison ivy, which drives the crew wild or, you know -- or some odd thing about it. That would be odd. He's supposed to know that. Yes. And then, when he does that incorrectly -- Yes. -- mistakenly -- Yes. -- that's your problem? It's the owner's problem? Yes.
That's Atkins. This Court -- that's the district court ruling in Atkins. All right.
But the owner -- the master had nothing to do with it. It's just a total fluke -- leaving out that other. Right. And, suddenly, the charterer is liable. There's -- I guess people have operated under this rule, as you say, for a long time. Long time. Well, isn't it because -- But why? -- the charterer chose the port? Yes.
So that's exactly right.
If you ask me why -- Who? He did.
The charterer did.
He said, I want to take your ship.
You have a ship. Yeah. I want it to go to Paulsboro and I promise it'll be safe.
And we said, okay, let's go.
But that is not at all irrational or strange or anything.
And if he instead wanted to say, look, I want to go to Paulsboro, but all I'm promising is that I'll -- that I've exercised due diligence, I've done my best, I'm not taking responsibility, it -- we have to realize when you have a situation of unknown and not reasonably knowable damages, someone is going to be strictly liable.
It is inevitable.
We're just trying to figure out who it is. Our point is he wrote a contract -- he picked the contract.
And the contract said it'll be safe, rather than the contract saying -- But Gilmore and Black think that the language is ambiguous.
Is that why they recommended the other? Well, Gilmore -- let's just be clear.
Gilmore and Black, written some 40 some years ago -- Yeah, but they're pretty good. And as my -- my colleague from the Solicitor General's Office says, what Gilmore and Black says is we recognize that all the authority is on the other side.
We just think we would read it differently.
We would apply a higher bar. Both the district -- Because? Because we just think it -- it doesn't make sense.
It just -- And it doesn't make sense in their view because? Because it would just make -- it would -- it's not fair to the charterer.
You -- you should just put it on -- Because? It doesn't go a lot farther than that, Justice Breyer. Well, Gilmore and Black are not -- I mean, they're -- they're very good experts. They were. They don't make things up. So -- so -- so why? Justice Breyer, they actually didn't say they are making it up, just to be clear. Yeah. They recognize that the authority says one thing.
We -- you -- the Court tends to look to treatises to describe the state of the law. If you asked Gilmore and Black in 1975 and 1977 what the state of the law was, they would say we -- the state of the law is that the Respondents are right. And then you would ask them, with the exception of the Fifth Circuit's decision in Orduna, which is a complete fluke.
Remember, all the forms say that these things will be litigated and arbitrated in New York and London. Sometimes it escapes those jurisdictions because some third-party who's not a party to the contract, like the crane operator in the port in Orduna, gets involved in the litigation. But were it not for that, Orduna would not even have existed.
And the reason Orduna has not been a problem, the reason it has not been regarded as a lot of authority on either side, is that in the wake of Orduna, all these contracts still call for arbitration and litigation in New York and London.
That's why there are no follow-on -- I got that.
I knew Gilmore and Black in '75 and I should have asked them. (Laughter.) Yes.
Poor foresight on your end.
You could have asked them about the poison ivy.
But -- but -- I mean, Mr. Goldstein, would it be fair to say Gilmore and Black were incredibly smart men? There are two kinds of treatises in the world.
There's the kind of treatise that just sets out the law.
And there's the kind of treatise that says we are incredibly smart men and we could do it better. Yes. (Laughter.) Don't you think Gilmore and Black is the second kind of treatise? I do, yeah.
And I -- they -- they, in fact, say it themselves.
And -- (Laughter.) -- and I'm sure they appreciated all the citations of the Court. But, if you were to actually cite them in your opinion, you would be citing Gilmore and Black says the rule should be X. My point, or I was trying to start from Justice Alito's question, is what actually, if you thought the text was in equipoise, what would you look at, how the industry actually treats things? You would not cite Gilmore and Black against me on that position, on that question. Well, if we thought that the -- the text was perfectly ambiguous, couldn't we say we are incredibly smart people, and we think -- (Laughter.) -- that the better rule -- Yes. -- is the Gilmore and Black rule? Justice Alito, I learned a long time ago that if the question is couldn't -- could the Supreme Court do X, the answer is yes. (Laughter.) What -- it would be somewhat of a departure from this Court's decisions saying that you, in these kinds of cases, look to two things, and that is the industry practice and how the United Kingdom has interpreted maritime contracts. And so, while you could depart from that understanding, it would not be in a contract case what the parties actually expect because it is the case that they can get insurance.
We have cited the insurance policies in our brief. It would be very strange if the insurance industry said we recognize to the charterers you're undertaking this liability, but we just don't -- we just don't like to give you insurance. We'll give the ship owner the exact same insurance for the same liability, but, for the charterers, we -- we just don't like charterers.
That's not true.
It doesn't make any sense.
And it would be contrary to the fact that this has been the industry's understanding for a long time. I did want to explain the lighterage provision, if I could, which is on 8A.
I think what happened here is that my friend inadvertently just skipped some of the language in the contract. And it says at 8A: ""The vessel shall load and discharge at any safe place or wharf,"" and then here's the part that gets skipped, ""or alongside vessels or lighters reachable on her arrival, which shall be designated and procured by the charterer provided the vessel can proceed thereto, lie at, depart, and therefrom always safely afloat,"" and we agree that's don't hit the bottom or hit something on the bottom, ""any lighterage being at the expense, risk, and peril of the charterer. The reason there's a reference to the cost of lighterage is that in the third line the charterer is allowed to designate lighterers. They're allowed to say don't go actually to the port.
Unload onto a ship. On the question of where we get our damages, there is a damages provision in the contract, and it is at 20A.
It's very simple. Paragraph 23: ""Damages for breach of this charter shall include all provable damages and all costs of suit and attorneys' fees incurred in any action hereunder."" They promised us a safe port.
It was not safe.
It was a bad accident.
But, if you were to ask where is the textual basis for his position, where is there a reference in the safe port clause to due diligence, where is there a -- a reference to the idea that there will be no responsibility if the port turns out not to be safe and only if they are negligent? It doesn't exist. And just the last point, Justice Gorsuch, on administrability, remember, there is always going to be a question of causation.
And they agreed that they're liable if they didn't exercise due diligence. So it's not that their rule just avoids those questions.
It just points them -- it just puts the burden on another party. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and, again, may it please the Court: First of all, both of my friends refer specifically to these two forms.
There's not a shred of evidence in this case that any form other than the one that was actually implemented in this case was ever considered by the parties. And, indeed, one of the parties has never been in this litigation.
So the notion that there should construe what the meaning to these parties were with the language of the contract on the basis of a different contract that we have no idea whether it had any input whatsoever into this case -- But those -- -- seems to me -- -- those -- those other -- those other contracts were not a mystery.
They were well-known and in the trade. You could pick the safe berth or you could pick the due diligence. You may have had -- to be sure, Justice Ginsburg, they had the option to do that if they knew about that option, but there's -- again, typically, in a contract case, there's some evidence between the contracting parties that tells you who did what to whom and who made the selections here. All I'm saying is the fact that there are other alternatives does not tell you anything about the contract that the parties understood when they entered in -- into this agreement. With respect to abnormal occurrence, again, that is clearly an atextual analysis, again, by my friends over here.
There is no way you can get from the simple language of just safe berth and say but that excludes abnormal -- abnormal occurrence. You only do that because, at the end of the day, that is the most sensible way to read ""safe berth,"" which is to say it doesn't -- it doesn't make you the insurer against all things that can happen. And I submit to you that if you're not the insurer against all bad things that happen, one of the bad things that you're not insuring against is the anchor in this particular case. It is not a characteristic of this port.
This Court specifically defined objects in the sea, submerged objects in the sea that are unknown and unknowable as perils of the sea, not as characteristics of the port. The Court's already been down this road.
It ought to follow that same position that it took in G.R. Booth. And then finally, with respect to Gilmore and Black, what they say is the text is being way over-read by the prior decisions. All of those decisions ignore this Court's statement in Atkins that this cannot fairly be immediately assumed to operate as a warranty. And, finally, what they said as a matter of both policy and maritime commerce concerns is that the charterer is in the least effective position to prevent the prob -- the -- the injuries that will arise under these circumstances. And it makes no sense to put it on the backs of the party least capable of dealing with the problem because it creates insurance risks, it imposes unlimited potential liability, which this Court has consistently recognized. I'm not saying that this all should fall on -- on Mr. Goldstein's client.
Mr. Goldstein, if determined today, if this Court were to decide today that there's no liability for CITGO, he can go back to -- to the federal government and seek complete exoneration because the third-party here, the person who left the anchor in that -- in that waterway, didn't identify it, didn't tell anybody about it, that's the person who should be liable. We can't find that person.
There are two ways to deal with that.
There's exoneration for him completely because of that third-party, and there's the oil spill fund which would take care of it. My client's already spent more than $100 million on that fund.
It should not be -- it is not an equitable result to impose another $140 million solely on the party least capable of avoiding this particular problem. If there are no other questions, I would urge you to reverse, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-518, the Colorado Department of State versus Micheal Baca.
I note at the outset that Justice Sotomayor is recused in this case. General Weiser. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution authorizes states to use their plenary authority to remove a bribed elector, one who engages in a rebellion, or one who would perpetrate a bait and switch on the people of their state by voting contrary to a binding pledge.
By contrast, if a state wishes to treat electors as free agents, rather than as proxy voters, it is free to do so. In short, states determine how to select electors and ensure that they meet the relevant requirements and perform their duties as assigned.
This means, under Green, that states can oversee bribery as an incident as a power to appoint.
This must include the power to remove an elector without requiring a full criminal trial.
Under my friend Mr. Lessig's position, as a practicality, bribed electors would cast ballots and illegal votes. In this case, the State prevented Mr. Baca from casting a legal ballot, just like it's an illegal ballot if you don't sign it here in Colorado. As this Court explained in Ray, the purpose and history of the Twelfth Amendment reflected the reality that electors acted as pledged agents for their political parties.
And the history of such pledges should be given great weight. As to Justice Ginsburg's point about the importance of enforcing a pledge requirement, it's worth noting people rely on such pledges, which are taken voluntarily.
And as Justice Scalia explained in the Inter Tribal Council case, voting requirements would be of little value if not enforced. In the almost 70 years since Ray, states have continued to enact laws to enforce elector pledges.
Congress has consistently deferred to the states' plenary authority, and no court other than the Tenth Circuit below has invalidated a pledge binding law. Mr. Chief Justice, I would welcome your questions. Well, my first question is to ask if there is anything that General Purcell said on behalf of the State of Washington with which you disagree? Thank you so much, Mr. Chief Justice.
I would only add a slight wrinkle.
He did, indeed, endorse our Tenth Amendment argument.
What I would say on that is the Tenth Amendment is an important interpretive principle because the Constitution gave the states authority over elections.
The Tenth Amendment underscores that point. Would you state for me exactly what you think the limits on the state power to replace electors are? Your Honor, here, I would echo my colleague from Washington.
It governs whether or not another constitutional provision is violated.
The Fourteenth Amendment quite notably means a state could not remove an elector based on race or religion.
Also, the Qualifications Clause means you can't remove electors for the purpose of adding qualifications for who can be President. So, if you selected electors, one of the requirements is they had to be relatives of the legislators, that would be all right? Your Honor, here in Colorado, we picked electors in 1976.
The state legislature did it directly.
As long as that choice doesn't violate a constitutional provision, they can pick whoever they want. What if the rule is, you know, the electors are chosen pursuant to slates, but anyone who says anything disloyal to the State between the time they're selected and the time they cast their vote will be replaced? Your Honor, as my colleague from Washington noted, once people are voting to make a choice, people have a right for their ballots to be counted.
And, here, in the hypothetical you just noted, the ballots of people would be invalidated after the fact. That implicates Gray versus Sanders and this Court's line of right-to-vote cases. Any other limitations on the power of the State? What about the bribery cases that have been -- or bribery hypotheticals that have been discussed? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
The ability to remove bribed electors is crucial for the states to have and not only after a criminal trial but after there's a basis for this concern. To your point, if a state failed to remove a bribed elector, the state would not have violated a constitutional provision per se, it would have violated its duty as a sound overseer of presidential elections. That's even after the electors have been chosen? In -- in other words -- The State is -- Go ahead. Mr. Chief Justice, the State is indeed authorized to remove electors who have taken a bribe, if that's your question. Yes.
What about your -- your power-to-appoint argument? It does seem -- certainly, our cases involving the power to appoint by executive officials or the President do say that it carries with it the power to remove. But that has always been with respect to inferior officers.
And the electors here, it seems to me, are not inferior in any way to the state legislator.
They carry rights as appointees carrying out federal responsibilities as well.
So I don't see how those authorities support your position. Your Honor, we disagree. The Constitution clearly gives states plenary power over electors and as -- acting as a steward of the presidential election system. That means, if electors were to take a bribe, for example, or not to show up, it's on the State to address that point.
If you only left this to Congress in the final instance, that would mean that all Congress could do is remove the elector, not have it be counted. What the states can do is replace an elector and make sure that the state has the constitutionally authorized votes in the Electoral College.
As such, the states play a critical role, and that role includes the power to remove. Thank you, General. Justice Thomas? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General, you start your brief questioning standing in this case.
I wonder if you think, under our precedent, there's standing when a person is removed from an elected office? Your Honor, the past cases involving removal from an elected office, like Powell, for example, involve an official with a salary.
What's unique here is there's no salary or other personal injury. What's at issue here is the institutional role itself.
And as this Court made clear in Smith and a line of cases, an individual doesn't have standing to challenge an institutional role that he or she may believe is unconstitutional. So, in -- in a removal case, at what point do you think there would be an injury in fact? Justice Thomas, insofar as someone gives up a salary, like in Humphrey's Executor, you have injury in fact.
If it is a honorary position, a volunteer position, there's no personal injury, there's merely a quarrel with the institutional role. On -- on a separate issue, you know, throughout, I guess, our history, there have been not pledges among electors.
But can you point to me -- point out the first state law that required pledges in our history? I can, Justice Thomas. It was Oregon.
It did so in the late 19-teens. And what I want to underscore is that wasn't the first time an elector was removed for violating a pledge. In 1912, Nebraska, without any elector binding law, did remove an elector who had promised to violate the pledge because the court, in that case, the Nebraska Supreme Court, said it would have been a fraud on the people of Nebraska. You attach yourself to the arguments of General Purcell, so I do want you to -- I understood his comments on -- on the federal -- scope of the federal function concept or argument.
Could you give me what your take is on that? With pleasure, Justice Thomas.
Our view is that doctrine doesn't really fit here.
Under the Constitution, it's the role of the states as stewards overseeing the presidential election process. The typical federal function case, like McCulloch versus Maryland, you're worried about a state interfering with a federal official.
Here, as this Court has made clear multiple times, electors are not federal officials.
They are appointed by and oversee and transmit the vote of the states. Thank you, General. Justice Ginsburg? Can you give us an idea of the practical consequences of a ruling one way or another? How would a ruling against you actually alter our democratic processes? Most states already require elector pledges.
And faithless voting throughout the years has always been rare.
But how much difference does it make? Your Honor, the chaos that could result from upholding the Tenth Circuit's ruling is one that could occasion a constitutional crisis, as was noted by my colleague from Washington. If states have no ability to remove bribed electors and all that's left is Congress's ability to choose to count or not count, the mere fact of bribing electors in an open enough way would knock out electors, would limit who could vote, and ultimately could sway the outcome of a presidential election. It's the role of the states to oversee confidence in our election systems, to ensure that the public's voice is heard.
And all of those values, the integrity of our elections, are at stake in this case. Returning to the standing question, Baca was removed from his post.
Isn't that a stigma at least? Why isn't it -- it may -- may not have economic consequences, but isn't it a blot on his reputation? And -- and wouldn't that constitute a cognizable injury? Your Honor, the auditor in Smith believed that he suffered a stigma, having to implement an unconstitutional statute. And that concern of his stigma was not sufficient to give him standing.
I would submit the same rule holds here. Thank you. Justice Breyer? Good morning. A technical question.
The -- Smith is a lawsuit brought against you, the State, under Section 1983.
The Court's opinions, I take it, have made clear that a State isn't a person under 1983. Now everybody's waived that argument. Both sides would like us to rule.
But can they? If someone sues a foreign country under 1983, and a foreign country can't be a defendant under 1983, can the party simply get an opinion from this Court by waiving the question? Your Honor, I would start with Justice Ginsburg's opinion in the Northwest Airlines case, where she made plain that whether or not there's a claim for relief in a statute is not a jurisdictional question. What we're dealing with here, both under Section 1983 and Eleventh Amendment immunity, is strategic decisions made by our state in the course of litigation. We made those decisions because we wanted to litigate this case on the merits.
We believe we have a case on the merits and standing, and that's how we've chosen to proceed. Well, yes, but that isn't my question.
My question is, of course, you want a decision from this Court.
But Mr. Smith might want a decision about how the Constitution applies to someone in Mexico or to someone in Russia. I mean, can the parties get that advisory decision by simply saying: Oh, we waive all the jurisdictional problems or all the non-jurisdictional problems, all the problems that say this statute doesn't apply? Justice Breyer, this Court will opt for whatever ground it chooses. With respect to whether the Court has to rule on this issue, the answer is no.
This is not a jurisdictional question.
For us, this was one of several strategic questions on what grounds to litigate. Got it.
The other question I have is, I take it that it's only in 1960 that the first state passed a statute that actually removed or punished a person for voting the wrong way, an elector. So were there cases of bribery that went unpunished before 1960? And was there a single case? If so, how many? And what happened? Were their votes counted, although they were bribed? Justice Breyer, the first statute was in the late 19-teens in Oregon, but before that, there were -- I thought that was a statute which required a pledge that didn't punish people for how they voted, but, regardless, same point. Your Honor, we don't have a history of what types of changes were made. What we know is they happened all the time.
As Professor Hardaway notes in his brief, for example, in Michigan, there were electors who just didn't show up, who then were replaced on the day that the Electoral College had to meet. We haven't had electors who are upset about having been replaced or not counted -- That isn't -- -- until -- -- my question.
My question has to do with bribery.
And before the first statute was passed more than 200 years after the Constitution was first created, were there instances of an elector being bribed and, if so, how was it handled? We don't know of any such instances, Your Honor. Thank you. Justice Alito? In past elections, were there concerted campaigns to influence electors after the popular vote was cast for the purpose of either reversing the result that was produced in the Electoral College by the popular vote or throwing the case into Congress? Justice Alito, the most famous such case would have been in 1876 involving the Tilden/Hayes disputed election. My other question is essentially the same one I -- I -- that concerns me with respect to the positions of all the counsel in these two cases, and that is limitation, if any, on the arguments that are being made. So is it your position that a state has plenary power to remove an elector? If not, what -- under what circumstances can an elector not be removed? Your Honor, from McPherson, we do see plenary authority, oversight, and removal power of electors.
And the constraint on that is other independent constitutional conditions, such as ones we discussed previously under the Fourteenth Amendment, for example. So suppose the legislature is in the hands of a political party other than the party of the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state. Can the legislature simply remove all of the electors who were pledged to vote for that candidate and replace them with other electors? Justice Alito, this is an important point.
Let me first answer your question, then get to a slightly different one that raises the same concern. If the legislature announces the procedure in advance and gives people the right to vote and they exercise that right, the legislature cannot undo the public's right to vote without violating the right-to-vote line of cases. However, if the legislature acted earlier, say the prior spring, to change the process to give itself the power to appoint electors, not the power in the hands of the people, that's a choice state legislatures could make. In McPherson, it was litigated whether or not a legislature could move from a winner-take-all to a districting system.
There was a partisan motivation for that change, and the Court said the legislature's power was plenary. Well, if we agree with you that the legislature has plenary power to remove electors, then won't the people of your state understand when they cast their vote for President that the legislature has the power to remove the electors pledged to the candidate they favor and replace those electors with other electors? Justice Alito -- Won't they be without -- -- what we're asking for, what we believe the right to vote cases require, is that the public be told what they're voting on.
Per the Chief Justice's earlier question, if the public is told you are merely casting an advisory vote, as opposed to a binding one that you can expect will be followed, that's a different case.
The cases before -- But what is the -- what is your best -- what is the best right-to-vote case that stands for that principle? In Gray versus Sanders, it says the public has a right for their ballots to be counted. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? General Weiser, first, on your Tenth Amendment point, why doesn't Thornton foreclose that argument? Thornton said that the Tenth Amendment reserves only those powers that the states held prior to the ratification of the Constitution. I would think that the power we're talking about here is -- is -- is not such a power but, instead, was created by the Constitution in the first instance. So how can the Tenth Amendment support you consistent with Thornton? Thank you, Justice Kagan. What I would suggest here is a similar principle to what Justice Kavanaugh articulated earlier.
Justice Kavanaugh noted the chaos principle means, if you have a close case, you avoid creating chaos.
We would say, if you have a close case, you avoid intruding on federalism concerns.
And that's grounded and represented by the Tenth Amendment. But, again, I thought that that was only as to the powers that the states held prior to the ratification of the Constitution. Your Honor, as a strict matter, that is what the Tenth Amendment does, but there's also the interpretive principle picked up, for example, in Gregory versus Ashcroft that says, when looking at intrusions on state power, limits on state power, given to the feds, you do so lightly. Okay.
Mr. Lessig ended his argument by giving a number of hypotheticals.
He said, you know, if a state can do what you're doing, a state can also, say, enforce pledges to vote only for candidates who have visited the state or who release their tax returns or who take a position on certain issues.
Is that right? Not necessarily, Your Honor.
The tax -- tax returns issue has been litigated under the Qualifications Clause in California, and the court there said that did constitute adding a qualification to be President. But, moreover, I would note there's also an independent question about whether or not you could have a state saying we won't allow someone to be on our ballot in the state at all if they haven't done X, Y, and Z, and, indeed, in the California case, it was not in the elector context but in the access-to-the-ballot context that the issue arose. And -- and if you're relying on the Qualifications Clause, couldn't you be said to be imposing a qualification too? In other words, that the candidate actually have received more votes than anybody else in your state? Respectfully, Your Honor, I wouldn't interpret that as a qualification to be President, particularly because the right of the states to have a system where the people could be heard is part of the original constitutional design and then again confirmed in the Twelfth Amendment itself. Well, it sort of assumes the conclusion.
I mean, it's obviously a pretty normal understanding of -- of what elections do.
But, if you assume that these electors were meant to -- to use their own discretion, then the popular vote was not required and -- and it would be imposing a qualification. Your Honor, if you assume electors have this discretion, you've assumed the answer to this case.
We would say they don't have that discretion at all.
And -- Exactly.
But -- but you're assuming the answer in the exact same way, aren't you? What is or is not a qualification sort of depends on this case.
So I don't think that you can get rid of Mr. Lessig so easily as you would like to. Your Honor, our position is that the Constitution is silent on whether or not you can have electors representing how the public votes.
That is inherent in this design, and, thus, we say what's inherent in the design couldn't be an additional qualification. Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I'd like to continue the same line of questioning that Justice Kagan raised with you and -- and Mr. Lessig suggested. If -- if states enjoy plenary power to remove electors, what would prohibit them from passing a law to say -- for example, to say that -- that all electors have to -- have to vote for presidents -- presidential candidates who support certain positions or who have done certain things or who have visited the state. Now I understand your ex post argument; that is, states can't change the rules of the election after the election and have to provide voters notice.
But, if they did it well in advance, what would prohibit them from doing so, if anything, on your view? Your Honor, I'm trying to square how this fits with a popular vote system because, if you give people the power to vote and they exercise the power, then our argument is you count their votes. What I believe you'd be getting at would then be a preclearance process where you'd have to preclear what electors could be on the ballot before people could vote on them.
In that system -- Well -- Yes. -- just to interrupt you, I'm sorry, counsel, but you've -- you've indicated it would be fine for people to have an advisory vote to 12 wise people who would then make the final decision. Why -- why couldn't you also have a system in which the people provide advice within certain parameters set by the legislature? Your Honor, I think that's the same context I had in mind, which is you would basically give people an advisory vote and then, after the fact, you'd have to ask whether the -- No, not after the fact.
They've been alerted prior to the fact, counsel.
That's my hypothetical.
I -- I -- I understand your point about after the fact. In advance, they've been notified that there are -- they are free to provide advice to -- to -- to -- to 12 electors, whatever the number may be, and their advice, though, is going to be bounded and there are certain things that the electors have to -- have to, because the legislature says, abide by or else they'll be removed.
And those are, again, you know, has the presidential candidate visited the state, has he taken this or that position, has he or she, you know, turned over her tax returns? Whatever -- whatever the conditions may be. It's a bounded choice. You've been arguing that choice can be bounded.
And this is just another bounds.
What prohibits the State from doing that? In this situation, the State can add limitations as long as they comply with other constitutional provisions. And do those? The requirement to visit a state I don't believe clearly violates any constitutional provision.
The tax return issue, we've noted, raises a Qualification Clause question that could be a real concern.
And the -- So the presidential candidate is on the ballot.
It's who the electors can vote for.
Is that a qualifications problem in the State's view? Yes, it would be because, if you tell electors they can only vote for -- pick whatever the concern would be -- tax returns, people over 50, the concern is you could be adding a new qualification to be President and thereby disqualify, in effect, someone from being President who the Constitution would qualify to be President. How about other -- how about political positions or -- you -- you say visiting the state, that's permissible, that condition would be permissible in your view? Your Honor, I don't see off the top of my head any other constitutional constraint that would address that issue.
Our position is the power is plenary or exclusive, as this Court said in McPherson.
The State can oversee electors and remove them who don't follow requirements the State deems appropriate. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, General.
What is the purpose of having electors? Thank you for that question, Justice Kavanaugh.
When electors are set up in the constitutional design, that allows for states to make a choice.
Electors can either vote as proxy voters on behalf of the public, as we do here in Colorado, or they can be free agents. By having this structure uniform across the several states, you give states the ability to choose which model they want. But wouldn't -- if that were the design, why not just leave it to the states, as opposed to going through all these details about how the electors are supposed to operate? As you know, Justice Jackson in Ray, looking at that history, said no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated was that electors would be free agents to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the people best qualified for the nation's highest offices. That's the end quote from Justice Jackson. So that implies not a choice but actually a requirement that the states give this kind of independence, free agent status, to electors.
And why -- why go through all the details if it's -- if it's the way -- I guess what I'm asking more broadly is the text has all these details to set up a design that seems closer to what Justice Jackson articulates. Where in the text do you hang your hat? Your Honor, our text -- textual hook is the delegation of the authority to the states.
By contrast to what Justice Jackson said, James Madison said the Electoral College was all about giving the states authority to oversee presidential elections as they saw fit. And as the majority in Ray noted, contemporaries of the founders did, indeed, see electors as proxy voters on behalf of the public.
And that was absolutely the backdrop to the Twelfth Amendment, so I would also point you to the Twelfth Amendment, as effectively confirming and accepting the fact that electors can be, indeed, most often are, proxy voters, not free agents. Why do you think the founders did not leave it up to the states to decide whether they wanted their members of Congress to be electors? Your Honor, the Constitution had a series of compromises between separating powers between the states and the federal government and between the states.
This was one of those compromises that was reached at the final days of the Constitutional Convention. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
You have a minute to wrap up if you'd like. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. As we've noted, this case is all about State authority.
And on the theory of my friends on the other side, states have no authority even to remove bribed electors short of a full criminal trial. Our founders gave the states this authority, expected them to exercise it in ways that were sound.
That's what has been the history of our presidential elections. We would urge the Tenth Circuit decision to be reversed. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Harrow. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about a tradeoff between flexibility and rigidity.
The State's rule is too rigid, and that rigidity could come at a steep cost.
The State's binding law has no exception.
If a candidate dies between the popular vote and the vote of the electors, there is no exception. If a candidate has a stroke, there is no exception.
If there's widely recognized fraud or bribery by the candidate, no exception. If there will be a tied electoral vote and a potentially deadlocked House, no exception.
The law is rigid. Electors vote for the winner of the popular vote in the State or -- well, there is no or, Your Honors.
That's the only option. That rigidity has no place in our constitutional universe.
If something goes awry in this coming election or any other, the framers thought that electors could vote with discretion, and the Twelfth Amendment didn't change that. More recently, the Twentieth Amendment's framers, when they analyzed these contingencies, recognized even 150 years after the framing that electors still had discretion and electors could and should use it in the case of death of a candidate.
This shows that, given the current system of presidential selection by an Electoral College, there must be times when electors and only those electors are best placed to act in the interest of country. Your Honors, the states have a problem with the idea of an Electoral College and they want to write it out.
They make no bones about it.
They haven't so far today.
And perhaps we would be better off without indirect election, because its months-long, multi-step process of presidential selection presents some risk of instability no matter who wins this case.
But until we have an Article V amendment, the vote of real humans called presidential electors isn't going away. To make sure the system we have works sensibly, given the Constitution we have now, when those human electors do vote by ballot, they must be permitted to do so with discretion, Your Honors. Thank you, counsel.
I'll begin by asking you the flip side of the question I asked General Weiser.
Is there anything that Mr. Lessig said with which you disagree? No, Your Honor, we filed an -- an opening brief, and I'll -- I'll sign on to exactly what he said in the first hour. Thank you. You gave a number of examples there of situations that have gone awry and there was no way to take account of them.
But I'm not sure your position has any limits either.
What -- what are the limits to your position? The limits, Your Honor, are that electors must be permitted to vote with discretion.
And so, as Your Honor notes, there -- there is a choice.
There is always the possibility of bribery, always the possibility of corruption, and the framers considered all the possibilities and placed the ultimate selection of President in the hands of a group of presidential electors that were appointed by -- So I take -- -- the State. -- I take your -- I take your answer when I ask for limits to be that they must be allowed to vote in their discretion that you don't have any limits? Your Honor, there are no limits in that voting by ballot so long as the ballot is for a person.
The Twelfth Amendment says they must vote for a person.
You can imagine -- indeed, you don't -- But, literally, as opposed to, say -- -- have to imagine -- -- not a giraffe? I mean, of course, they have to vote for a person. Your Honor, Congress concluded in 1872 that the Greeley vote wasn't a vote for a person because it was a vote for a non-living person.
I'm -- I'm sorry if I was unclear.
That's the situation that I meant. But -- but those are really the limits of the discretion there.
There's great discretion in appointment.
There's -- there's -- you know, the -- the State can absolutely discriminate between all kinds of people, and they do on the basis of political party, for instance, but, once the vote begins, that vote by ballot is the electors. So the elector can decide, I am going to vote -- I'm going to flip a coin and however it comes out, that's how I'm going to vote? Yes, Your Honor, that's the same discretion that U.S. senators have, representatives have, congressional electors have.
These too are elected officials and they have that same discretion. Well, that sounds pretty limitless to me.
Let's say that an elector has a contract -- the different parties insist that electors sign a contract that you will vote -- if we win the popular vote, you will vote for our party's candidate. And if you don't, there'll be liquidated damages of a thousand dollars, an elector is selected and breaks that contract, votes for the other individual even though that individual didn't win the popular vote. Can that contractual commitment be enforced by the State? Not legally, no, Your Honor.
And that shouldn't be surprising because that's the same prohibition that applies to congressional electors, who cannot sell their votes, even though, as a condition of participating in a primary -- and we cite these cases extensively in our reply briefs -- there you can force regular voters to take pledges and oaths to support a party.
You just can't cross that line and enforce them. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, you mentioned that senators are free to vote or members of the House of Representatives, but there's some degree of accountability for them when they vote a particular way. What's the accountability here for an elector who strays from what is expected? There are several forms of accountability, Justice Thomas.
The first, of course, is the selection process, because they are party people and, in all 50 states, they're selected by the political parties. From there, after the vote, they can be kicked out of the political party.
They cannot win election.
They -- they can have negative political consequences.
And that's the exact same thing with senators, right? Senators do have accountability, but that accountability comes six years later.
So, if a U.S. Senator, Justice Thomas, promises to support only low taxes and then at every opportunity raises taxes, their only accountability is six years later.
That's the nature of political discretion, and that's the discretion electors have here. But there's also accountability in chambers -- within the Senate, there's accountability as far as removal from office. But you're saying that with an elector, that those other forms of accountability are not available? They are, Your Honor. There is absolutely party discretion, party meetings, just like any other representative body. And -- and just to -- to quibble slightly, Justice Thomas, with what you said in terms of removal of a U.S. Senator, there's no precedent that we have found of a U.S. Senator being removed, perhaps even by an appointing governor in the case of a vacancy, on the basis of a vote.
Certainly, some sort of criminal misconduct, sure, but not on the basis of a vote.
And that's the -- really the same analogy here. But let's say the -- you know, you mentioned with respect to the State that the State could not -- that after someone dies, that their system is so rigid that you can't make changes because of the -- the death of the candidate. But I think that, on your side, you -- as the Chief Justice alluded to, you have a similar problem because the elector, who had promised to vote for the winning candidate, could suddenly say, you know, I'm going to vote for Frodo Baggins, and that's -- I really like Frodo Baggins.
And you're saying, under your system, you can't do anything about that. Your Honor, I -- I think there is something to be done because that would be the vote for a non-person, you know, no -- no matter how big a fan many people are of Frodo Baggins. That -- that said, I do think the important point is that the framers hashed out these competing concerns.
They hashed it out in Philadelphia in 1787.
They understood the stakes, and they said, among these competing hypotheticals, electors are best placed to make the ultimate selection.
That hasn't changed, Justice Thomas. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg? I don't understand your point about rigidity, because, as I understand, the State's position is it's the states have a choice.
They can say electors have an independent vote, or they can say the electors must follow the parties' orders. So the states are not -- the states are being given leeway to do it one way or the other way.
So why do you say it's rigid when it seems to me it could be described as supple because states can have it either way? Justice Ginsburg, the states do have great flexibility, as you mentioned, in choosing the mode and method of appointment, but the laws that they've written here, the laws that were enforced against my client, Mike Baca, were -- are very rigid.
They are rigid in the sense that there are no exceptions once passed. And that rigidity conflicts with the supposition that every single Congress that has looked at the issue of presidential selection has assumed exists, explicitly in 1933 with the Congress drafting the Twentieth Amendment, that's a -- a key oversight of these laws, but even down to the more modern era when Congress was debating the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, for instance, forbidding poll taxes, and noted that it needed to bar poll taxes for elections for presidential electors, because they still exist in our system.
So that's the rigidity I'm talking about, Justice Ginsburg. And how do you answer the standing question, that you have no economic -- Baca has no economic injury, so he has no standing to complain? There is standing, Justice Ginsburg.
I will say there's a very small economic injury.
We've asked for one dollar in nominal damages. Mr. Baca gave up an additional five dollars of salary.
I'd just like to correct the record, where Attorney General Weiser said there's no salary.
Colorado Statute 1-4-305 provides electors with five dollars.
That's at Pet. App. 10. But the -- so the stakes financially are small, but the stakes constitutionally and personally for Mr. Baca are large and they are sufficient to confer standing. Thank you. Justice Breyer? Thank you. To go back to the technical point, you brought a suit under 1983 and -- against a state.
And it's fairly clear in the case law that you can't sue a state under 1983.
What are we supposed to do about that? Your -- Your Honor, I'll echo what Attorney General Weiser said, which is that it's -- and, indeed, I'll cite to the Court's opinion just last week in the Sineneng-Smith case, when the Court said that the courts' job is to resolve disputes as framed by the parties.
And so the only way that the Court should look at that issue is if it's jurisdictional.
And as Attorney General Weiser said, it's not. I'll give you two cites, Mt. Healthy against Doyle -- The problem that I view is that then any two people, a plaintiff and defendant, who would like an issue decided by us, simply have to waive enough matters so that it has to come before us because it's not jurisdictional.
They interpret the statutes differently.
They do whatever they have to do. What are we supposed to do about that? Your Honor, I don't think this case implements something like that because this case is one that courts surely could hear. It was initially brought individually against the Secretary of State through a compromise that involved the plaintiffs giving up a right to attorneys' fees and other accommodations.
It was somewhat reframed in order to be brought against the Department of State. And as the Tenth Circuit said -- I'll just point the Court to Pet. App. 53 to 70.
It was a really -- Yeah, I'll look -- I'll look at that.
One other question.
You didn't mention in terms of accountability what I take it -- why didn't you -- is that Congress doesn't have to count a vote of a faithless elector.
For at least 125 years, there were faithless electors from time to time, and Congress usually counted them and sometimes they didn't.
With Horace Greeley, for example, they didn't. So is that not a power that the Congress has to make certain that the faithless elector does not cause trouble? Justice Breyer -- What's your view about that? Well -- What's your actual view? You didn't mention it, so you don't think it is, probably. No -- no, I think, Justice Breyer, to be clear, that the Greeley example supports our side.
The Greeley votes that were rejected, Your Honor, were actually faithful. I know it's your side.
I'm interested in why you don't consider those as significant.
I would like your true answer to that. Your Honor, just so I understand, the Greeley votes, the three that were rejected by Congress, were actually faithful.
They were electors that pledged to Greeley. All right.
But, I mean, doesn't Congress's power -- there's 3 U.S.C. Section 15, there's the Constitution saying count it.
Does that act as a significant check on the faithless elector or does it not? It -- it can, Your Honor. The courts and Congress have never interpreted the Electoral Count Act and what it means for a vote to be regularly given. It -- Congress I do think possibly has the power to reject a faithless vote under certain circumstances, but we note it has never done so.
Those Greeley votes that were rejected were faithful votes for Greeley, who was deceased, and the 63 votes of Greeley electors who voted for other people, who were faithless in some sense, those were all counted. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito? We have to interpret the Constitution to mean what it means, regardless of the consequences, but I am interested in -- at least in understanding what the consequences of your position would be. And we are told by experts on elections that the consequences would be potentially chaotic.
I'm thinking in particular of Professor Bennett's brief and there have been other writing by experts on elections that acceptance of your position would mean that, after an election where the apparent outcome based on the popular vote is a small margin of victory for one candidate, there would be concerted campaigns to change that result by influencing a few electors, and that could be achieved by influencing just a few electors. That's just one of the consequences. There's the fact that in most states the electors are not even listed on the ballots, and, therefore, the voters have no way of trying to ensure that the electors who were chosen are electors who really will honor the wishes of the voters.
So do you really deny that this is where your argument would lead? We -- we do deny it, Justice Alito.
And, here, I think, past is prologue.
Attorney General Weiser, in -- in a response to a prior question on this same issue, noted that there had been campaigns already to affect electors.
He mentioned 1876, the famously contested election of 1876.
But, in fact, Robert Alexander, a scholar of presidential electors who we cite on the last page of the reply brief in Chiafalo, Alexander's research shows that there have been concerted campaigns in 2016, in 2000, and beyond, that some 20 percent of electors have contemplated switching their vote and that 100 percent have been contacted. Do you deny that there's a greater -- And the basis to conclude -- -- do you deny that there's a greater chance of this happening? And didn't Mr. Lessig support such an effort in 2016? Your -- Your Honor, Mr. Lessig has been representing these electors from -- from the beginning in 2016.
So I -- That -- that wasn't my question.
Didn't he advocate that some electors change their votes for the purpose of changing the outcome of the 2016 election? Your Honor, I believe that he supported the legal discretion that electors have that we're here today arguing for. And -- and -- and the reason is, A, that that's in the Constitution, but, B, that if we're going back to the chaos point, the center has always held -- the center has always held -- we know that 18 states today, Justice Alito, have no such laws. And the -- the states are not about to say that there's some constitutional requirement that they implement them.
In fact, they say the reverse.
They say it's a feature and not a bug -- I'd like to ask -- -- that there is federalism here. -- one more question if I possibly can.
Do the states have any power to remove electors? I can't think of any government office holder who cannot be removed from office. Your Honor, yes, they do have some power to remove elector, just not a removal power that interferes with the core function of voting by ballot. What is the limit of their power to remove? The -- the limit of the power to remove is, again, that -- that interference with the core function.
So, if an elector does not show up to vote, the states have represented that it's our view that's impossible to remove and replace that elector. That -- that's not true.
That's -- that becomes a vacancy.
The Electoral Count Act permits it to be filled.
History shows that it can and will be filled. Can an elector be removed for bribery, absent conviction by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, before the time when the electors meet to vote? No, we don't think so, Your Honor.
And that's consistent with the treatment of every other elected official. Senators and representatives cannot be removed for a supposition of bribery, a mere whisper of it.
They have to be removed for proof it.
And the same thing would be true here. A member of Congress could not be removed from office by a two-thirds vote without a criminal conviction? Oh, the -- the Congress certainly has power to remove, but it must go through a full process.
It -- it -- I -- I took Your Honor to be asking about the sort of instantaneous, you know, removal, I'm -- one -- one official, one single state official is going to make a decision to kick someone out based on rumor. That -- no -- no, that -- you know, that would be inappropriate for any sort of elected official, and it's inappropriate for -- for electors. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Mr. Harrow, suppose that I read the Constitution and I find that it just doesn't say anything about this subject, you know, that there are some hints here and there are some hints going the other way and mostly I just read it and I say the Constitution is silent. What should I then -- then do and why? Justice Kagan, in that case, I think the original understanding would control.
Again, if -- we think there is clear language in the Constitution and I want to return to that, but the original understanding would control because it is so clear and, indeed, Colorado doesn't even necessarily challenge it, that the original expectation -- Meaning the -- -- and the meaning of the word -- Sorry, do -- do you mean the original understanding like prior to ratification? The -- the -- Because I would think that pretty -- pretty quickly, it -- it -- it flipped even if you're right, pretty -- you know, so that from the first, there were these pledges and there has never been a substantial amount, a substantial number of faithless electors, so I would -- I would think that the -- the history both at the time and since would cut against you.
No? No, Justice Kagan, because our quibble is not with the pledges and our invocation of history is not with the pledges or the idea of party control and of having two major parties in our system. The idea is with enforcement of the vote.
The idea is with what occurred here, removing an elector who actually votes.
Mr. Baca actually presented a vote and attempted to vote and place it in the ballot box and that was rejected. That is novel, Justice Kagan.
That has only happened in 2016, despite the party control of the selection process.
And turning -- What would you say if I said that if I think that there's silence, the best thing to do is leave it to the states, to not impose any constitutional requirement on them? Your Honor, I -- I would push against because I don't think there's silence, especially here in this state -- I know, but that's the hypothetical.
I -- I just -- if I just think that there's not enough in the same way that Ray thought that there was not enough to provide a -- an answer to the question, and there are all these states doing what Colorado is doing, why not just leave it to them? Because, Your Honor, when, Justice Kagan, when you said there are all these states doing what Colorado is doing, it has actually never been the case that a state has done what Colorado is doing.
That is 220 years of unbroken history.
I think that speaks very loudly if Your Honor is concerned about how to interpret that silence. And -- and -- and so -- Justice -- go ahead, please. No, no, Your Honor. If -- if -- if you're ready to move on, then, fine, I was going to continue making another point. No, that -- that was directed to Justice Kagan. No, I'm done, thank you. Okay. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, suppose Mr. Baca had asked Congress to count his vote and Congress decided to do so.
Would we be here? I -- I -- yes, you would, Your Honor.
There -- there is no mechanism for Mr. Baca to ask Congress to count his vote under the Electoral Count Act that the State has pointed to any mechanism, other than perhaps making a phone call to a senator, the same -- I believe you're fighting my hypothetical.
Let -- let's suppose he had asked Congress and let's suppose Congress had agreed to count his vote.
That's my hypothetical.
Would we be here? If Congress had counted his vote instead of the vote of the replacement elector, Celeste Landry, then no, perhaps not because in that he wouldn't have lost the office. I will say he didn't get a chance to vote for vice president either, so assuming on Your Honor's hypothetical that he had his ballots fully cast, then no, we -- we probably wouldn't be here. Okay.
He didn't seek -- he didn't try to ask Congress to cast his vote, did he? He -- he did not, Justice Gorsuch.
There's no mechanism for it and the State hasn't pointed to one. Okay.
And -- and the damages he seeks are -- is it six dollars? Is -- is that right? Justice Gorsuch, it's even less, it's one dollar in nominal damages. One -- one dollar. So it's a one dollar nominal damages. And why -- why should we exercise our discretion to hear this case when the nominal damages are one dollar, he didn't seek Congress to count his vote, though as you point out, it's unclear whether there's a mechanism to do so, and we have a cause of action that doesn't exist based -- that -- that -- that we are asked to overlook because of a stipulation by the parties? Why isn't that a sort of manufactured litigation that this Court should -- should decline its -- should -- should -- should bother with, with using its discretion whether to decide a case? Justice Gorsuch, because once there is jurisdiction -- and, again, I'll just emphasize that the question of -- of whether -- I'm accepting there's jurisdiction, counsel, but this Court has discretion over what to entertain, and it also has some -- some authority to emphasize the importance of -- of the adversarial process and its proper uses. It -- it does, Justice Gorsuch.
And I think the arguments today and the brief show this is highly adversarial on the standing and on the merits. And the discretion here is because there was a conflict in the lower courts on an important issue and the -- the unique chance that this Court has to decide this issue of presidential selection outside the -- the very contested context of an -- an actively fought presidential election. So, to the extent Your Honor is talking about discretion and not jurisdiction, I think it's well exercised here.
And -- and, again, Colorado doesn't contest that. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Harrow.
How, if at all, should the quick growth of political parties affect our analysis of this case, including how the Twelfth Amendment interacts with Article II? Justice Kavanaugh, the political parties provide the context for nominating electors and the appointment of electors.
But they -- the fact that there are political parties now and were emerging political parties when the Twelfth Amendment was passed in 1803 doesn't affect that the word ""elector"" remains in the Constitution and that electors are people who vote, and all of those words and all of those structural principles mean that they can vote with discretion. And Justice Kagan noted a question about what to do if the text is silent.
And we've talked about various things that could fill the gap there, including the State's authority. Another, of course, under our case law is historical practice under cases like Noel Canning and Dames and Moore and many others, that we looked to historical practice as a gloss on the text. What is your strongest point on why the historical practice favors you rather than favoring -- favoring the other side? Justice Kavanaugh, in addition to the historical practices that we've already discussed, including in the exchange with Justice Kagan, I'll also point the Court to the history of constitutional amendments that have been introduced to try and abolish the office of elector precisely to eliminate the elector discretion that everyone who -- that was introducing the amendment assumed exists. As we point out in our brief, this starts in 1801 with no less than Thomas Jefferson saying: Hey, maybe we should get rid of the office of elector.
It can only cause trouble. And that continues in the 19th and 20th century.
For 20 years, such amendments were introduced by Thomas Hart Benton in essentially every single Congress.
And those amendments were not meaningful.
And the people who thought that we ought to eliminate elector discretion were not writing on a blank slate; they were writing knowing there was elector discretion.
And that would be a lot of wasted oxygen, Your Honor, if -- if there was already a way to eliminate elector discretion and if they didn't have it in the first place. Thank you very much. Counsel, you have a few minutes for wrap-up if you'd like. Sure.
Just to conclude briefly, as the Court knows, the intervention here was extraordinary and unprecedented.
And if Colorado is permitted to undo the human check that has been baked into this system of presidential selection, there really could be a chaotic outcome. By contrast, most electors have been free in most elections, and here we are today, Your Honors.
Indeed, electors retain legal discretion in 18 states, as I've said, and a decision from this Court won't change that. So the question for this Court is whether to approve of the State's novel intervention, and it is novel, and be left wondering how the State's overly rigid interpretation could go haywire in, as we've discussed, the case of death or other unforeseen circumstances, or instead whether the Court should keep faith with the system, keep faith with the Constitution until amended and maintain indirect election, acknowledging that both sides here, both sides have a vision of presidential selection that is imperfect, but the various checks, balances, and separations that our Constitution's drafters and amenders have put into the Constitution, all of those should be given a role in our constitutional universe. And, Your Honors, I -- I think that all adds up to elector discretion. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel. General Weiser, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me make three points in response and offer two closing thoughts. First off, on standing, the payment or non-payment of the per diem fee was never before alleged, and any reported non-payment is not in the record. Second, on nominal damages, prior cases like Smith and Bird did not accord standing on nominal damages alone, instead focusing on whether there's an actual personal injury. Second, as to Justice Scalia's important point about congressional remover -- removal in the case of bribery, it's worth noting there is a prescribed removal process for senators, as Justice Alito noted.
In the case of electors, there's no such process, which means this Court's default rule controls.
The power to remove is thus incident to the power to appoint. Third, it's worth noting this is the first time we've seen an elector who violated a state binding law.
Up until now, including the 2016 election, we've always seen Congress defer and count votes as transmitted by the states. Two closing thoughts.
During the course of this entire litigation and this argument today, my friends on the other side have failed to offer any viable theory on how to address the spectacle of a bribed elector, an elector who votes for Frodo Baggins, or one who would perpetrate a bait and switch on the people of our state.
Colorado's pledge requirement addresses all such harms. After over 230 years of constitutional tradition, my friends on the other side would toss out our nation's state-centered model of electoral accountability in favor of a treacherous experiment.
We urge this Court to reject this dangerous time bomb and avoid a potential constitutional crisis by reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1171, Comcast Corporation versus the National Association of African American-Owned Media. Mr. Estrada. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held in this case that a plaintiff may succeed on a Section 1981 claim merely by showing that race was a factor that was considered in the defendant's decision-making, even if the decision would have made and was made for entirely appropriate business reasons having nothing to do with race. Solely on this basis, the Ninth Circuit saved the Plaintiff's third complaint from dismissal.
We submit that this decision is wrong and should be reversed for at least three reasons. The first is that it is contrary to this Court's decisions, such as Gross and Nassar, holding that but-for causation is the background rule that Congress must have presumed to have been adopted in all federal statutes unless the statute provides otherwise, which we submit Section 1981 does not, either as originally adopted in 1866 or as amended in 1991. Second, in 1991, Congress amended Title VII to provide for a motivating factor standard but did not amend Section 1981 to provide the same, even though it amended Section 1981 in other respects at the same time. This all but conclusively shows that Section 1981 requires but-for causation, as this Court concluded in Gross and Nassar, with respect to the ADEA and the retaliation provisions of Title VII. And, third, it is -- if the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, it would be vastly easier to recover damages under Section 1981's judicially implied cause of action than under any express cause of action actually enacted by Congress under any federal antidiscrimination law.
And, thus, affirming the Ninth Circuit would effectively mean that Section 1981 would completely displace the carefully tailored regime that Congress has devised in Title VII to govern employment discrimination cases. No well-advised plaintiff would ever sue under Title VII in any employment case. Counsel, it -- I -- I wonder if the distinction they're fighting over is -- is somewhat academic.
I -- in the contract negotiation process, for example, there may be several steps along the way, and if at one of those steps there's clear racial -- excuse me -- animus evident and that, you know, the process continues on, and at the end of the day, the contract is denied, it -- it may be hard to prove but-for causation. On the other hand, it's also hard to ignore the part -- the step in which there was clearly evident racial animus.
And it may be a reasonable argument or -- or -- excuse me -- allegation that that animus continued through, even though manifested only at one stage of the process. Well, all complaints are different, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't rule out, you know, the possibility that a complaint may allege such an expression of animus that it could actually imply that the animus continued until the end, such that it -- the complaint does allege but-for causation. Now the Plaintiffs, from the motion to dismiss in this case to the Ninth Circuit, have stuck their case on the proposition that they are alleging that race was a motivating factor and a motivating factor only, and they were not prepared to prove but-for causation -- causation. And, you know, we contend that that is wrong under Gross and Nassar.
Now we don't think that this complaint actually passes pleading standards under any standard, as we made clear, but, of course, you know, it is also the case that we have cases like Gross and Nassar in which it is evident from the record that some consideration of the protected factor was made in the employment context. And at the end, you know, the jury still had to be instructed that it had to determine whether that was a determinative factor in the decision-making. And in all of these cases, you know, the Court has already determined that the -- that the fact finder will have to make the decision, as -- as Gross said, whether that factor not only played a role but also had, as Justice Thomas put it in Gross, a determinative effect in the decision-making. Mr. Estrada, you -- you said that the Respondents here continue to say that they don't have to prove but-for causation.
I'm a little bit confused about that point.
And I guess this is for Mr. Chemerinsky to think about as well. But, in your reply brief, you make the good point that on page 47 -- Forty-nine. -- or 49 -- Right. -- of the Respondents' brief, they seem to say the opposite.
They seem to suggest by quoting that Third Circuit case -- The Kaz case, right. -- that, in fact, they are going to have to prove but-for causation at the end.
And the question here is really what they have to allege now. I -- And if -- if -- if -- if we take it that way, I mean, Mr. Chemerinsky can say what he wants to say about that, but let's just assume that that's true, that they are going to have to plead but-for -- excuse me, that they're going to have to prove but-for causation at the end; that is the ultimate standard in the case. But this is a complaint.
And, you know, it's pre-discovery and the Plaintiff is not going to know what the Defendant was thinking about in making whatever contract decisions the Defendant was making. And -- and -- and so what do you think the Plaintiff has to allege at the beginning? Well, I think -- you know, I have two answers to that.
I think, first, the Ninth Circuit's ruling in this case had nothing to say about the difference between pleading and the merits.
In fact, the Ninth Circuit worked from what was needed to prevail on the merits to then upholding the complaint. Yeah, so I take that point, and I would think that if -- if my assumption holds, which is that the Respondents do have to prove this at the end, then you would have to say that the Ninth Circuit is wrong. But you would still have -- That would not be novel. -- the question of whether the complaint is sufficient. Yes.
Now the second point I was going to make is the whole question of whether there may be burden-shifting has been introduced somewhat coyly by the Respondent.
We don't actually know what their position is on that, but I understand what they're trying to say based on the Kaz case, that is, maybe that but-for sort of applies in the sense that the burden of showing but-for causation is shifted to us so that, in a sense, what actually is happening is that they are arguing for the PriceWaterhouse framework without daring to name its name. Yes, so they could be saying that -- and I guess this is another thing for Mr. Chemerinsky to be thinking about -- they could be saying that, that this is essentially an attempt to shift the burden of but-for causation onto you. But they don't have to be saying that. If I -- Excuse me, Mr. Estrada.
They don't have to be saying that. They could be saying no, we -- we really do believe that in the end we're going to have to prove but-for causation, but because we're pre-discovery, because we can't really -- I mean, you don't want people throwing around baseless allegations in their complaint, that -- that -- that a complaint should be found sufficient even if it doesn't allege but-for causation. You know, it's enough to say they made a racist mark and they gave -- and they gave contracts to lots of white firms that weren't as good as our firm.
And that's enough.
That -- yes. Well, the -- now the -- the -- the answer to -- you know, the bottom line answer to, I think, the theory that underlies all of your questions is that -- the answer to your question is actually controlled by Rule 8, Twombly and Iqbal.
And it's actually very clear from Iqbal especially, which was a discrimination case, and from Twombly antecedently, where Justice Souter, in writing Twombly, said we do not want people to open the doors to discovery based on conclusory allegations or formulaic elements of the offense dressed up as factual assertions. And, in our view, that's what we have in this case.
And so it is not an answer to say, because you can say that in practically every case, antitrust, antidiscrimination, et cetera, that the facts especially with respect to mental state will always be in the possession of the defendant. Well, Mr. Estrada, though -- If -- Can I -- -- isn't it -- isn't it -- I'm -- I'm sorry. No, go ahead. Isn't it perfectly common when -- when -- when you're alleging a mental state of an opposing party and you have yet to have discovery to -- to allege on information and belief mental states, and isn't that the simple solution here? Well, yes and no, Justice Gorsuch.
You can -- you can -- you can allege that so long, under Twombly and Iqbal, as you also allege -- You have to have a good faith -- -- facts from which -- -- right, right, but positing Justice Kagan's facts, there's a statement and you have some factual circumstances that might lead to that inference. Yes, yes. Then you would -- you would plead that mental state. And if you plead the factual circumstances that plausibly give rise to the inference, then you would have a case that -- that possibly complies with Twombly and Iqbal. Well, but isn't that the point -- Maybe.
I mean, you -- you said Iqbal and Twombly, and that seems quite right, but we had this case before Iqbal and Twombly, which is in the Title VII context -- I'm not sure how to pronounce it -- Swierkiewicz or something like that. Versus Sorema, yes. Which -- which -- which Twombly said we're thinking about that case and that case is still good law.
And what -- and what -- what that case said -- this was actually a McDonnell Douglas shifting case -- Uh-huh. -- with the prima facie case.
And Swierkiewicz said you don't actually have to in your pleadings even show the prime facie case, that we understand pleadings in this field are really different.
And -- and Iqbal and Twombly says, yeah, that's still good law. With all due respect, Justice Kagan, I think that that is not a fully accurate characterization of the case or of how Iqbal actually distinguished it. What was happening in the Sorema case -- let's call it that to make our lives easier -- is that the Second Circuit had ruled that the complaint was deficient because the plaintiff had pled -- had failed to allege the McDonnell Douglas framework in the complaint. Now the Court overturned that ruling, pointing out that the McDonnell Douglas framework is an evidentiary framework that a plaintiff may choose to use at a trial, not a pleading framework.
And that was what Twombly actually later, you know, reaffirmed. And what Twombly was basically saying is you may choose to prove your case in a particular way, but you are not required to -- to -- to plead that in all cases. McDonnell Douglas, for example, does not even apply if you have direct evidence of discrimination.
It's a way to prove your case circumstantially. So it doesn't make sense to impose on plaintiffs, you know, the burden to put that in a pleading.
And I think all the Court was saying is that if a plaintiff has a choice down the road to prove his case in a particular way, that is not a requirement of pleading. But, again, none of that has anything to do with -- But I'm not sure -- I go back to the Chief Justice's initial point, which is, if I come forward and show that race was a motivating factor, it can also be the but-for.
Until a defendant is deposed and discovery is held, then that becomes an issue for the trier of fact of whether or not that motivating factor was a but-for cause. So I think as long as you have enough in your complaint to show racial animus and a reasonable inference can be drawn that that's a but-for cause, I think a plaintiff has done more than enough. Well -- What you seem to be suggesting is that they're required to anticipate every potentially independent reason you may have had without really knowing it -- Well -- -- and disproving it in the complaint.
That makes no sense. No, actually, I -- I have said nothing to -- to -- to that effect, Justice Sotomayor.
I have said that under Twombly and Iqbal, a plaintiff is required to allege facts, not conclusory recitation of the elements of the offense, that plausibly give rise to the inference. The problem is that the Ninth Circuit -- neither the Ninth Circuit and even the government admits that it didn't look at this complaint through the lens that would be provided if we find but-for causation. Correct.
But I will point out that if you find but-for causation, you would then have to examine that under the requirements of Iqbal that require -- Not us.
The Ninth Circuit. Well, somebody.
It would be -- it would be permissible to -- for you as you did in Twombly and in Iqbal itself. Iqbal, of course, was a discrimination case, and you examined the complaint in that case, too, thinking that that would be informative for the lower courts. It would not be, you know, with all due respect, you know, as many worthy efforts have been made in this case, through Blueline, the complaint in this case, for the edification of the Court. I mean, it is worth reading because there are any number of allegations in the complaint to the -- But if the -- There are a lot of -- -- Mr. Estrada, if the -- if the Respondents now agree that in the end the burden of -- the -- the -- the substantive standard is but-for, is there a dispute about that issue before us, or is the only question before us whether enough facts were pled under 12(b)(6) and Iqbal and Twombly, which is what this seems to have devolved into and is, therefore, not the big issue that has been portrayed? Well, I think that for -- they would further have to agree that what they mean is but-for causation, and they bear the burden of persuasion like on all elements. So the disagreement then would be, you know, if the evidence is exactly in equipoise, which way does it go -- No, I think they -- -- that's what it would be? -- no, I think what they mean to say in accepting the CAS standard is but-for in the sense that they accept the PriceWaterhouse plurality opinion.
They just don't want to call it that because they understand that this Court is not buying it. Okay.
So it's -- it's -- what would happen if it's in equipoise and who has the burden of production on the issue? The burden of persuasion, Your Honor, because, under the -- Yeah. -- plurality in -- in PriceWaterhouse, you know, the burden of persuasion, even if it is but-for, shifts to the defendant. Right, but it's but-for by a preponderance.
It's a question of who has that -- Correct, but I -- -- who has that burden. -- think what's really going on is that the Respondents are really arguing PriceWaterhouse, as they did expressly in both courts below.
They're not actually citing it, but they are actually in a way sort of admitting that somebody has -- may have a but-for burden of persuasion, but they would like it to be us. Now that is also equally wrong for any number of different reasons. Yeah, well, I -- But if you're -- -- don't know why the Ninth Circuit did what it did here and I don't know why the Respondents have argued the case the way they did here. But, if -- if you look at the recitation of facts on pages 3 to 5 of the Respondents' brief, could you say that those are insufficient to raise in a -- if pled, those would be insufficient to raise -- to satisfy the pleading standard even if the burden of persuasion is but-for causation? Comcast told Entertainment Studios its channels are good enough.
It needed to get support in the field. It turned out that, according to them, that -- that it didn't matter whether they got support in the field and so forth.
There is a recitation of facts. Yes, we do say that that's enough.
And -- and we have a number of reasons for that.
Some of what they say is actually not in the complaint and has not been in the last two complaints.
That's point one. Some of what they say about, you know, the demand for their services is something that they were able to allege in their third and last complaint, you know, all of the notion about how much they're carried and how many customers, you know, they reach, is driven entirely by the fact that they are currently -- may I finish, Mr. Chief Justice? Sure. -- that they're currently carried by AT&T and DirecTV, which is -- which are now one company. Now it should be perfectly clear to everybody in this courtroom that that's an allegation that they were only able to make in the third complaint in this case.
It was not in the first or the second complaint.
And the reason for that is, during the pendency of the entire litigation in this case, they were suing AT&T and DirecTV as they were suing us.
And that -- Thank -- thank you, counsel. Thank you. Ms. Ratner. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals found that a plaintiff can prevail under Section 1981 if race played any role in a decision not to contract, even if it was not a but-for cause. That's wrong under this Court's decisions in Gross and Nassar, and nobody defends that test as the ultimate standard for causation under Section 1981. Instead -- and I think this gets to Justice Kagan's line of questions -- Respondents invoke burden-shifting to argue that at the pleading stage, motivating factor -- a motivating factor can be enough. That might have been true under PriceWaterhouse burden-shifting, but PriceWaterhouse no longer controls.
So, for the first time, Respondents turn to McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting instead. But McDonnell Douglas, even if it applies in this context, is not relevant to the causation question.
It shifts only the burden of production at trial.
So it can't affect the elements that a plaintiff needs to prove or that a plaintiff needs to plead. And the Swierkiewicz decision that Justice Kagan pointed to underscores that.
It says that there's no different analysis under what was then the old notice pleading standard, but now, under Twombly and Iqbal, for these types of antidiscrimination cases. Can I take you back to the basic structure? Mr. Chemerinsky can speak for himself as to what burdens he's accepting or not, okay? But I'm looking at the statute, and I don't see any of the but-for language, ""because of"" or any of the other that we have interpreted in any other statute. What I see is a statute that says all citizens must have the same right.
And if you -- talking about in the making, performance, execution of the contract.
And we've also said the civil rights law was designed to eliminate all race discrimination.
I'm not sure how we can square those two things with a but-for. How can it be that if you're treated differently because of your race in the formation of the contract, but you're denied the contract for another reason, that other people may have been denied for, but you were treated differently, more burdens were put on you, more expenses were put on you, and at the end, they say, eh, you know, we really would never take on anyone like you with your business because, and it's true, nobody with your business plan has been accepted before, but you've been run around in circles and made to expend a lot of money -- So -- -- why is that not actionable? So let me give you three responses, Justice Sotomayor.
The first is the text says the same right to make a contract.
I think if you asked an ordinary English speaker whether someone who would never have been granted that contract, regardless of her race, whether that person was denied the same right to make that contract, I think people would say no. Except the dictionary -- But even if that's -- -- the dictionary says definition of making is just ""the process of being made."" Yeah. So it's the process.
It's not just the entering into the contract.
There are different words in the statute. So I'm happy to address the making point, but let me just -- But I want to -- -- underscore the -- -- but I want to go back to the broader point, which is how can you say that you have the same right and that we're eliminating all vestiges of discrimination if we are not using motivating factor but are using a but-for standard? Justice Sotomayor, there's a lot baked in there.
I -- I think to the extent you think there is some ambiguity in the ""same right"" language, the next place to look is a very important textual clue, and that's Section 2 of the 1866 Act.
So, when Congress originally enacted this provision, Section 1 was the general declaration of rights, Section 1 of the 1866 Act.
That's now become Section 1981. And Congress had an enforcement mechanism, Section 2, and that does use classic but-for language.
So I think that's a good indication of the substantive scope. And true enough, 100 years later, this Court inferred a private right of action, but I don't think that can change the substantive scope that Congress enacted. I -- I -- I -- unfortunately, I -- I'm stuck back at the Chief Justice's question and I think what Justice Gorsuch was elaborating on that, that -- as I understand their questions, but -- but, anyway, my question is I don't understand; if we're talking about pleadings, what's the difference? I mean, you know, they have some evidence, and the evidence is, on information and belief, we think that the Defendant here used race improperly to deny us the contract.
Then they list it. And who cares whether they say it was a motivating factor or whether they say it was a but-for? I -- I can understand it making a difference later when you decide who has the burden of proof, because, at that point, you know, the Defendant maybe should have the whole burden of proof.
After all, he knows what's going on in his mind and the Plaintiff doesn't. The -- Or maybe you should say you split it, production versus -- but we're not apparently arguing about that.
We're just arguing about the complaint.
And, sure, you want him to say information and but-for, they'll say but-for.
You want him to say motivating factor, they'll say motivating factor. Can you give me a case where it makes a difference? Yeah, Justice Breyer, I think it's often going to make a difference later down the line -- Yes, later down -- -- when it's important to get the standard. -- the line.
But if we eliminate that out -- And let me give you a -- let me give you a hypothetical.
This is sort of a silly one, but instead of thinking of but-for in sort of a formal legal way, think of it as, did race plausibly make a difference? Someone applies to be an associate of a law firm.
They get a letter back where they think there's some sort of racial language in there, and the letter also says: And, also, we're not hiring you because you never went to law school. If that person files a complaint complaining about the racial aspect of that denial, I don't think any court would say that there was any plausible way that that person was going to be hired as a law firm associate, regardless of their race, because they weren't a lawyer to start with. Those are the types of things that are going to -- No, then it -- -- be explained about -- -- wasn't a motivating factor.
It wasn't a motivating factor and it wasn't a but-for condition.
There we are.
I mean -- So I think the core difference, and -- and you see that in the court of appeals' decision, is the idea that race could have been some sort of consideration, but a consideration that had no ultimate effect on the result. Well, if it's a -- And that's -- -- consideration, it's true it wouldn't be a consideration where the applicant was a white person.
Indeed, it couldn't have been. And if the applicant is a black person, it could be.
So this says -- the statute says you should treat a white person and a black person alike.
And so, I mean, that's their reasoning. If it really does make a difference, and -- and -- and I don't -- I'm stuck -- If it -- -- on both those points. -- if it really does make a difference, then you have but-for causation. But-for cause does not mean sole cause. Even though it says alike -- It means -- -- and even though a black person and a white person -- even though a white person wouldn't be treated -- Okay. -- that way because, of course, he couldn't be. On that separate question, the statute does not say everybody is to be treated alike for all purposes.
It says that everybody, regardless of race, has the same right to enter a contract. And we certainly agree that any consideration of race is pernicious and it has no role in private conduct, but this Court has made clear in Domino's Pizza that Section 1981 is not an omnibus remedy for all racial injustice. Well, I think -- Can I take you -- -- what you're -- what you're saying is that this makes a difference at the pleading stage in those rare cases, if they exist at all, where the complaint goes out of its way to refute itself. I -- I think that is very true.
And I think there are certain circumstances, and we don't have a position on whether this case is one of them, where someone could go out of their way to say what the potential arguments of the defendant are. But where the rubber is going to meet the road in a lot of these cases is going to be at summary judgment.
So we think it's important that the Court -- You agree in this case that we should vacate, therefore, and remand and not resolve the issue here? We don't have a position on whether this particular complaint satisfies Twombly and Iqbal.
We don't think the Court's ordinary practice would be to go on and resolve that question, is there anything formally -- You agree that it's -- -- stopping the Court? No. Excuse me.
You agree it's unusual with a complaint with paragraph after paragraph of allegation like this to toss it at the 12(b)(6) stage? You know, I -- I don't want to get into the particulars of this complaint because we don't have a view on it.
I think oftentimes the additional allegations could be things that cast doubt on the plausibility of some other allegations.
It's possible that that was what -- Well, in general -- -- was behind the district court's thinking. -- what would you say a complaint has to do in order to survive a 12(b)(6) motion in this area? A complaint has to do exactly the same things that a complaint needs to do under the Age Act, under the ADEA, under Title VII retaliation claims.
This isn't a new innovation.
It's just plead enough to think that race made a difference. And if a judge looks at those allegations and plausibly believes that race made a difference, then that's going to be enough to survive under Twombly and Iqbal. Are you endorsing the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting -- not burden-shifting, but the burden remains with the plaintiff, but the -- the production with the defendant to set forth the reasons why? So the Court said in Patterson that McDonnell Douglas applies in 1981 cases at least in the employment context.
We think it's an open question whether it would apply beyond the employment context -- So -- -- but for purposes -- -- should we address that issue? I don't think so.
For purposes of this case, we'd be willing to assume that it applies here.
It just doesn't matter under that Swierkiewicz decision I alluded to before -- Not for the pleading stage, but we did grant -- the question presented was whether -- what the standard was. Yes. May I respond? McDonnell Douglas does not change the standard.
It shifts only the order of introducing evidence at trial, so it won't have an effect on the ultimate standard. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Chemerinsky. Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Statutory language matters.
Where federal civil rights statutes use the words ""because of"" or ""based on,"" this Court has inferred a requirement for but-for causation. But this Court has never created a requirement for but-for causation in the absence of such language.
Section 1981 uses no such words. It's crucial to remember the procedural posture of this case.
It is on a motion to dismiss.
All the Ninth Circuit held was it's sufficient to state a claim under Section 1981 to allege that race was a motivating factor in the denial of the contract. This is on page 2a of the supplement to the cert petition. There is a good deal of confusion in this case so far about the relationship between motivating factor, but-for causation, and burden-shifting. Where this Court has adopted a motivating factor standard, it's then adopted a burden-shifting framework.
That's true in constitutional cases.
It's true with regard to Mt. Healthy versus Doyle and Village of Arlington Heights.
It's true in statutory cases like McDonnell Douglas and Burdine. On the other hand, where the Court has adopted but-for causation, it's rejected burden-shifting, such as in Gross versus FBL Financial Services. Ultimately, Your Honors, the issue before this case was pled can be resolved by looking at the plain language of Section 1981 and Congress's broad remedial purpose. To start with the plain language, Section 1981 says that all persons should have the same right to contract as white individuals. This is about creating a requirement for color blindedness with regard to contracting. If race is used as a motivating factor in denying a contract, then there is not the same right with regard to contracting. Also, in terms of the plain language of the statute, it's very important to compare Section 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 with Section 1. Section 2, which provides criminal consequences of violation, does use causal language, such as ""by reason of"" and ""cause to be subjected."" Section 1 does not use such language. At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, what is the burden of persuasion in this case, in a case like this? Your Honor, this Court has never reached that question, and it's not presented here on the pleadings. Ultimately, the question would be, does the burden of persuasion shift, as under Section 703M, or does it remain with the plaintiffs at all times? We think that implicitly, by, in Patterson versus McLean, adopting the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine framework, it would say the burden of production shifts, but the burden of persuasion is always -- The burden of -- -- with the plaintiff. -- persuasion as to what, Mr. Chemerinsky? Are -- are -- are -- what is your view as -- in -- in the last analysis, ultimately, does but-for causation have to be shown? In the end, Your Honor, I believe that this Court's adoption in Patterson versus McLean of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework does indicate that the burden of persuasion in the end would rest with the plaintiff. But -- but burden of persuasion as to what issue? The burden of persuasion in terms of showing that the contract would not have been issued but for race. Okay.
So -- But that's very different, of course, Your Honor, as compares to what has to be pled. Yeah, so -- so this is just a pleading case.
This is just an issue of whether it's a -- it's a, you know, a 12(b)(6) Iqbal/Twombly pleading case. That's exactly right, Your Honor.
That's why I began in my introduction by pointing you to page 2A of the supplement to the cert petition where all the Ninth Circuit held was that, in this case, the Plaintiffs had to plead that race was a motivating -- You're -- -- factor. -- you're not agreeing with the Ninth Circuit then? No, Your Honor, I am agreeing with the Ninth Circuit. Not -- not with their test. Well, remember, in this case, all the Ninth Circuit focused on was pleading, and that's all the Ninth Circuit should focus on because this is on a motion to dismiss. Now I do think there's an issue down the road that could be faced, is at the very end who has the burden of persuasion? Here, I think Patterson versus McLean -- You just said, I thought, to Justice Kagan, that the Plaintiff would have the burden of persuasion at the end of showing but-for causation.
Did I mishear that? No, you didn't, Your Honor.
What I was saying was by -- in Patterson versus McLean, this Court, adopting the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, McDonnell Douglas shifts the burden of production but never shifts the burden of persuasion.
And so, in that sense, that's why we said Patterson versus McLean seems to answer the question. So all you're arguing, I think, is if you plead motivating factor, that that's enough to survive at a pleading stage? Exactly. But you accept that as a -- as a matter of burden at trial or in summary judgment, you do have to prove but-for causation? That's what this Court, I think, implied in Patterson versus McLean by adopting the -- So what -- So what do you do -- -- McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. -- so what do you do with the extreme example that the assistant solicitor general raised? You know, you're black, but -- and you're not a lawyer.
We don't hire non-lawyers. And you don't allege in the complaint that you're a lawyer or that you graduated from law school or whatever.
What happens in that? I assume in that instance that there's not sufficient allegations, even under Swiekiewicz versus Sorema. But, Justice Sotomayor, imagine a different example.
Imagine that somebody files a complaint that says, I went to a hotel to rent a room and I was told that I was not going to get a room because none were available and also the hotel doesn't rent to blacks.
Should that be sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss? We would say yes, because his race is a motivating factor.
The argument on the other side is, because it doesn't allege but-for causation, that wouldn't be enough. And that shows why but-for causation is an inappropriate, in fact, often an impossible standard at the pleading stage. You -- you would -- Mr. Chemerinsky -- If you asked -- if I understand your answer to Justice Sotomayor's question about Ms. Ratner's hypothetical, why is it that that fails under your view at the pleading stage? They would say, well, based on whatever the racial indication is in the letter, that that may have been a motivating factor. If the complaint alleges that race is a motivating factor, then that is sufficient in order to state a claim. Even if it also -- even if, as in -- in the hypothetical, the person's not a lawyer? Well, the reason I answered Justice Sotomayor that way is it has to be plausible that the plaintiff can recover.
If an element of the cause of action is not present, then it's not plausible.
And I think that would be the question under -- What -- what -- -- Iqbal and Twombly. -- what element of the cause of action would be absent in that hypothetical? I think the question is, is it plausible that the plaintiff was discriminated against on account of race. In the hypothetical that's given -- please, Justice -- Justice -- No, I was just going to say, even though a -- a -- a white person would not have had that discriminatory -- in other words, been denied an equal -- they're not treated the same, which is your theory, but they're treated differently on the account of race because one was the subject of a racially discriminatory conduct -- comment and the other wasn't. You're right, Your Honor.
As you're spelling out the hypothetical, I would say if the complaint is plausible that race was a motivating factor, that should be enough to withstand the motion to dismiss. Why doesn't it -- why doesn't it also fit the but-for test? I mean, you know, if he hadn't been black, they would have rented it to him. Well, but, Your Honor -- Well, then why on those same facts can't you put your bottom line, and, therefore, but-for the racial discrimination? What's the difference? Go back to the hypothetical. I can't get the difference between motivating factor and but-for. But there's an enormous difference, which is why -- What? -- this Court has so often said motivating factor.
Let me go back to the hypothetical that I gave to Justice Sotomayor. Yeah.
Yeah. A hotel says to an individual that we're not renting a room to you because we have no rooms and because you're black. Right. That doesn't allege that race was a but-for cause. No, but it does allege the famous tort case that every student studies, the two hunters.
Okay? Summers versus Tice. The two -- correct. Thank you. They're both -- Excellent.
Head of the class. (Laughter.) But in -- in -- in -- in that -- in that case, you had two hunters and they both shot the person, either would have been sufficient. Now no tort professor ever said that that doesn't meet the but-for case -- test.
And even though literally it would have happened anyway, okay? So what it seems to me is the other is that possible exception, but I don't know why ordinary tort law wouldn't take care of it. But, Your Honor, this Court has so frequently drawn a distinction between motivating factor and but-for causation because it matters so much. It is much harder to allege and prove but-for causation than to allege that race is a motivating factor.
And so that's why especially at the pleading stage it's essential -- But could you answer -- could you answer Justice Breyer's question? Sure. Wouldn't the very hypothetical you've given us satisfy the but-for test? No, Your Honor, because the position that -- You disagree with the case? Was it Tice? No, I don't disagree with Summers versus Tice. All right.
Well, that's good.
That's a start. (Laughter.) Your Honor, the position that the -- opposing counsel has taken is that the complaint has to deny all alternative explanations. No, no, that's not the position, at least as being explored by Justice Breyer.
It's just that it has to be plausible that it caused the injury. And isn't the hypothetical you've given us meet that standard? There are two contributing causes.
They're both but-for causes.
And under traditional tort principles, why wouldn't that be exactly the sort of case that would survive a 12(b)(6) motion? I would hope it would, but that's not how -- Okay. -- this Court has often used the phrase but-for causation. All right. Would it be all right to explain? Suppose the opinion said, look, it's the defendant who knows what's in his mind. How can you expect a plaintiff normally to know everything in the defendant's mind? How could you? And so all he has to do is allege on information and belief that he thinks that this racial part of it was motivating and -- and -- and now say call that motivating or call it but-for. But he has to believe that.
And -- and then we go on to what's actually difficult, I think, is the burden-shifting.
Suppose we said something like that. Well -- No? Yes? -- Your Honor, yes. I mean, I think that if the -- if the answer is this complaint goes forward either way, and the Ninth Circuit was correct, I will accept that answer, of course. Well, Mr. Chereminsky -- (Laughter.) So you just don't -- So I'm not going to -- The legal rule doesn't matter.
You just want to win? Mr. Chereminsky -- I want the law to be clear that motivating factor is sufficient because I think often but-for is very difficult. All right, but on that, wouldn't it be unusual for us to say that the test for the pleading stage is motivating factor, but the test at the trial or at summary judgment is but-for? Emphatically, no, Your Honor.
This Court in -- Why -- why wouldn't that be a little unusual? Because this Court in so many contexts has ultimately said it's but-for -- No.
Well, now -- -- but, at the pleading stage, only motivating factor. -- we -- we've said in PriceWaterhouse it's motivating factor throughout.
We haven't made some special exception for pleading stage. And McDonnell Douglas, which you relied on earlier, is a but-for test.
And the plaintiff just has to plead a prima facie case of but-for causation or -- or motivating factor, depending on the circumstances -- No, Your Honor. -- and context. First, Swierkiewicz versus Sorema specifically says, and it was a unanimous decision of the Court, that plaintiffs do not need to plead a prima facie case. Second, in every area -- Well -- -- where this Court -- -- we can disagree over what Swierkiewicz said, but -- but isn't -- isn't it the -- wouldn't it be a little unusual for us to apply different legal standards at different stages of the same case? No, Your Honor. Take constitutional cases like Mt. Healthy versus Doyle and Village of Arlington Heights. All that's required at the pleading stage is motivating factor, though, in the very end, it would be but-for causation. This is true under McDonnell Douglas and Burdine as well.
What's required at the pleading stage is very different than what's required at the very end. On McDonnell Douglas -- But what if the -- I'm sorry. What if the complaint alleges this was not the but-for cause of the adverse action against me, but it was a motivating factor? Would that be sufficient to go forward? Yes, if I understand your hypothetical.
All that should be required at the pleading stage is motivating factor. Even if -- even if it concedes -- even if the plaintiff concedes in the complaint that it wasn't a but-for cause? And even if but-for cause is the standard at the end of the day, the case should be permitted to go forward toward its inevitable doom? But, Your Honor, the whole point of the burden-shifting framework is to be able to establish what was the actual cause.
The problem, as I go back to Justice Gorsuch's question, is it's not realistic to say to the plaintiff that you have to allege that this was the but-for cause and deny all other causes at that stage. Well, that's right, but that seems very different from saying you have to allege a motivating cause. I mean, it's true that you cannot expect the plaintiff to negate everything else that might be in the defendant's mind.
This is pre-discovery.
The plaintiff isn't going to know everything else that could have been in the defendant's mind. But, as long as the plaintiff comes forward with sufficient allegations to say, given what I know, you know, this defendant made a racist remark, this defendant gave contracts to white firms that were not as qualified as our contract were, why do you have to label that anything? Why do you just have to say those are the kinds of facts that at this stage of the litigation allow the -- the complaint to go forward? I think they should be, Justice Kagan.
As I said to Justice Breyer earlier, I think -- all we're saying is that those allegations should be sufficient. And as Justice Alito pointed out, pages 3 to 5 of the complaint allege those facts, and each of those facts is found in the second amended complaint. If we -- But then, Mr. Chemerinsky, it -- don't you think that the Ninth Circuit has to be reversed? I mean, I'm just going to read you a sentence from the Ninth Circuit which seems to say something very different. It says, ""even if racial animus was not the but-for cause of a defendant's refusal to contract, a plaintiff can still prevail"" -- prevail, not like satisfy the pleading standard -- ""prevail if she demonstrates that discriminatory intent was a factor in that decision."" So, I mean, that seems wrong, right? But it wasn't the issue before the Ninth Circuit.
The issue before the Ninth Circuit was solely about the pleading.
And, here, I direct you to the language I referred to on page 2a of the -- Can we just have an answer -- If we -- if we -- -- to Justice Kagan's question -- I'm sorry. -- before you proceed on to page whatever it is? Sure. I -- I just -- I'd be grateful to know, doesn't -- don't you agree that the Ninth Circuit was wrong? What I was saying is in terms of the statement of whether or not in order to prevail.
And my response to Justice Kagan was that wasn't the issue before the Ninth Circuit -- I understand that. -- or this Court. I understand that. But I would say, Your Honor -- Would -- would you agree the Ninth Circuit was wrong, though? Well, what I would say is what I said to Justice Kagan's initial question.
Patterson versus McLean adopts the burden-shifting of McDonnell Douglas -- I've -- I've got it. We're not going to get an answer. I'm sorry. If we -- if we -- if we write an opinion -- if we write an opinion that says in 1981 cases, the plaintiff has the ultimate burden of persuasion to prove that race was a but-for cause of the decision, we vacate and remand for the Ninth Circuit to analyze the complaint, what is wrong with that decision? Well, because it's not the issue before this Court, Your Honor. Well, isn't it the issue given what Justice Kagan just read from the Ninth Circuit's decision, which influenced how the Ninth Circuit assessed the complaint? If we articulate the right standard and then vacate for them to analyze the complaint under the right standard, wouldn't that be the -- the better way to go? But the right standard for the complaint is to allege that race was a motivating factor.
Whatever is the conclusion with regard to who ultimately has the burden of persuasion doesn't change the pleading stage. And that's why I keep going back to what the Ninth Circuit actually held on page 2a -- Well, we wouldn't be saying -- -- of the supplement to the complaint. -- we wouldn't be saying anything about the pleading stage under the hypothetical opinion I just articulated.
It would just be saying the ultimate burden of persuasion in 1981 cases, contrary to what the Ninth Circuit has -- had said per Justice Kagan's recitation. Sure.
And I think this Court, if it wanted to face the issues now before it, could say at the pleading stage, motivating factor is sufficient.
Patterson versus McLean says the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine burden-shifting applies.
It shifts the burden of production but not the burden of persuasion. And I think that would deal with all of the issues that we're talking about here. Sure -- I'm not sure -- Is the burden of -- -- look, now at least I've got in my head what I -- God.
Don't go further if I don't have it right. Smith says this man wouldn't contract with me.
I know him.
He is the most bigoted person in this state, and, as normal, he said all kinds of racist things and jumped up and down and so forth.
And, by the way, he's my fifth cousin, and he hates me, and I've never met anybody who hated me so much.
And I think, for both reasons, he would have never entered into this contract. Now there we have two sufficient causes in the absence of the either, and do you win under this statute or do you not? Because the reason they put it in the pleading stage is if you -- what you allege, I don't know there ever has been a complaint like this, but if there were, if you don't win, then why do we let you go further if you can't win? Your Honor, because this Court has said we don't want to determine at the pleading stage what was the actual cause. That's a question of fact for the jury. But do you think you do win or not? I mean, you know, the two hunters, they win.
Do they win here or not? If at the end the plaintiff concedes that he or she would have never gotten the contract anyway, I believe, at the end, under the standard adopted in Patterson versus McLean, the plaintiff would not prevail. So that the -- But that doesn't -- I'm sorry.
Go ahead. I was going to say but that doesn't tell us what's required at the pleading stage or at the prima facie case stage. Well, why don't you -- Well, we're talking about -- I'm sorry. -- what is or is not before us.
It seems to me that your focus is on the availability of the burden-shifting mechanism, right? Yes. Well, that's not in the question presented either. That's correct, Your Honor.
I think the only reason that I go to the burden-shifting was Patterson versus McLean adopted the burden-shifting, and it answers many of the questions that have been put to me today. But the -- I -- I -- -- only issue before you, because this case is on a motion to dismiss the pleadings -- Mr. Chemerinsky -- Yes. -- the worst thing we could possibly do is to try to describe a pleading standard on the basis of McDonnell Douglas or PriceWaterhouse, which were trial burdens or summary judgment burdens. Why isn't it simple enough to say you -- from the allegation, it's a reasonable conclusion that race was a -- was -- was the but-for -- was the reason for the denial of a contract? Exactly, Your Honor. So -- and in -- That's all you need to say in this case. And I don't disagree with you, potentially, that in most circumstances, you prove a -- you prove a motivating factor, that'll be enough.
That's what I think my two colleagues have been saying. And I completely agree. I hesitate to say some thing is the worst thing we could do. (Laughter.) But -- No, you're right. We've done a lot worse. (Laughter.) But -- but if -- if it is a reasonable conclusion based on what you've pled, why have you so strenuously resisted alleging but cause -- but-for causation? Your Honor, because we live in a world of multiple causes, and we believe that all that's required by the plain language of the statute or by Congress's broad remedial intent is that race be a motivating factor. We do actually allege but-for causation in the complaint.
I mean, if you look at the complaint itself, and I can direct you to the specific paragraph of the complaint, it says but-for causation -- paragraph 103 of the complaint says that ""the denial of the contract was"" -- and I'm quoting the words -- ""on account of race."" And the specific paragraphs of the complaint support that.
So we do have a section in our brief that we meet the requirement for but-for causation. But I think when you focus on the statutory language, when you focus on Congress's broad remedial purpose, it did not mean to impose a requirement for but-for causation at the pleading or at the prima facie case stage either. Mr. Chemerinsky, it just strike -- strikes me as confusing to throw in a different causal standard for the pleading stage as opposed to the ultimate stage, as opposed to saying, look, at the pleading stage, we understand that not everybody's going to know everything, so we're going to not require too much in the way of -- of -- of -- of proof. I mean, you're suggesting that but-for cause is sole cause.
But-for cause has never been sole cause.
There can be three but-for causes in a case.
You know, if you take away each of these three things, the outcome would have been different. But motivating factor is something different.
Motivating factor you can take out and the outcome would still be the same.
And it just seems quite confusing to me to put in something that's not the same question as the ultimate question at the pleading stage, rather than to understand the pleadings are pleadings and they're before discovery and nobody can be expected to know what the defendant is going to say. I disagree, Justice Kagan.
This Court has repeatedly adopted a motivating standard pleading approach, even though in the end it's a but-for cause standard. I go back to what I said to Justice Gorsuch.
If you look at the constitutional cases like Mt. Healthy versus Doyle, Village of Arlington Heights versus Metropolitan Development Corporation, all that's required at the pleading stage is motivating factor. That's true with regard to Title VII as well.
It's a motivating factor standard at the pleading stage. I think to require but-for causation at the pleading stage would be often an insurmountable burden.
In fact, that was Justice O'Connor's point in PriceWaterhouse, how but-for causation -- But these -- the -- -- is so difficult. -- I'm sorry -- these cases, as you know, are not usually thrown out at the motion to dismiss stage and usually you have the ultimate legal test in mind, and you just look at the facts alleged in the complaint to see, as Justice Sotomayor rightly said, whether there's a way you could plausibly infer from those facts that it would ultimately meet the test for 1981 or for discrimination. And this is a helpful question for you.
Isn't -- isn't that just how it usually works? Yes. Yeah, I believe. (Laughter.) Yeah.
In other words, we shouldn't get in -- or why should we get -- I guess I'm picking up on Justice Kagan's now: Here's the legal test for 1981.
Go look at the facts alleged in the complaint, the facts, and just see whether they would meet the standard. And it's pretty rare, at least in my years of looking at discrimination complaints, it's pretty rare to throw one out at the motion to dismiss stage -- Your Honor -- -- as long as it passes, you know, a pretty low bar. And that's exactly right.
And that's what the Ninth Circuit did if you read the opinion in this case.
The Ninth Circuit says in the bottom of page 2A that the only question before us is the pleadings.
And it says that the standard is motivating factor at pleadings. Well, but -- And at the top of page 3, it -- -- the problem -- -- then says that's not -- -- the problem -- and I'm repeating myself, but the problem is that they were assessing that arguably, as Justice Kagan pointed out, with the wrong test in mind.
If they had the right test in mind, they still might allow the complaint to go forward.
But that was the question presented in the cert petition. But I think all this Court needs to say then is that the Ninth Circuit is correct in saying at the pleading stage, motivating factor is sufficient, and perhaps you want to remand to assess whether or not they applied the standard. Though I think, again, if you look at the top of page 3 of the opinion in this case, that's exactly what they did, was say there's plausible allegations here that race was a motivating factor. But -- but you've told me that we don't even have to do that because you say that you did plead but-for cause. Yes, Your Honor, we did plead but-for causation, but we do not believe that it's a requirement.
We believe that at the pleading stage all that's necessary is motivating factor. Well, that sounds like an advisory opinion for me saying, well, you know, they're not arguing that but-for cause is required, but they alleged it anyway, but we're supposed to forget about that and -- and instead address this very slippery question which isn't even presented under your argument today. Yeah, I agree with that.
I think the only question presented is about the pleading stage. It's quite notable that there was a second question in the cert petition that this Court did not grant cert on, and that was the question of whether or not the plaintiff has the burden of negating all other explanations at the pleading stage.
I think that shows why we're here today and what we're arguing about and why it matters so much. But I agree completely, Chief Justice Roberts, all that is before this Court is whether the Ninth Circuit was correct that at the pleading stage, it just has to be alleged, that race was the motivating factor in the denial of the contract. I know you didn't draft the complaint, but the complaint goes on and on and on with a lot of facts, including an allegation that Comcast entered into a racist conspiracy with the NAACP, the National Union League, Al Sharpton, and the National Action Network. And do you think that had any effect on what the district court did here in granting dismissal under 12(b)(6)? It shouldn't, Your Honor, because it's not in the second amended complaint.
And the only operative complaint before the district court, and the matter that's now before this Court, was the second amended complaint.
And the second amended complaint alleges many facts that would support plausibly that race was the motivating factor in denying contracts. And you alluded to these earlier on pages 3 to 5.
These are such things as that Mr. Allen was told over many years things to do and he'd get carriage.
He did those and didn't get carriage; that he was told that there was no bandwidth, but they then carried eight white -- 80 white-owned channels; that all of the channels that are carried by the other cable companies are carried by Comcast, except for Mr. Allen's channels. All of this is at least enough to allege that race is a motivating factor. But also enough to allege that the NAACP and the National Urban League and the other individuals were in on the conspiracy? Your Honor, that is not in the second amended complaint.
And the only thing that was before the district court and the matter that's before this Court is the second amended complaint. What you're referring to here is not properly before the district court and not properly before this Court. In conclusion, ultimately, this case comes down to two different conceptions of what must be pled.
Our view is there should be enough to allege that race is a motivating factor.
The other side says it has to be alleged that race is the but-for cause. When you think of Congress's broad remedial purposes in 1866, there can't be any doubt that Congress wanted then to open the door to claims with regard to race discrimination in contracting, not to close that door. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Estrada, three minutes remaining. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start with the last question that was asked and the answer given by counsel. I would refer the Court to the -- to the Pet. App. starting at page 54A and paragraph 59, which is the second amended complaint, which is the current complaint at issue, where the current complaint continues to allege that white-owned media and Comcast in particular works hand in glove with the federal government to execute this racist conspiracy. I would further refer the Court to paragraph 64 -- 62, 64, and 65, which are on the pages following, in which the current complaint goes on to allege that we paid off the signatories to the memorandums of understanding. It doesn't name them by name, but those were incorporated by reference and the district court took judicial notice of the MAU. And, obviously, the signatories are named.
They are the NAACP, the Urban League, and Al Sharpton. And so the allegation is that we paid off the oldest civil rights organizations in the court -- in the country to give us cover for race discrimination. The complaint goes on in paragraph 73 and 81 to say that we have minority-owned networks that are run by Magic Johnson and Diddy Combs, which apparently are some sort of artists, and it claims that these African American entertainers actually signed up with Comcast to give us cover for our racial discrimination. Now the period covered by the complaint is 2005 to February 2015, when the complaint was filed. So, in a nutshell, the theory of the complaint is that Comcast engaged in a racist plot with the Obama Administration, the oldest civil rights -- with the oldest civil rights organizations in the country, Diddy, and Magic Johnson. And that -- if that actually in any planet satisfies, I don't know how many paragraphs this has, Justice Kavanaugh, it -- it can have 100 paragraphs, but if in any planet that satisfies the plausibility standard on Iqbal, the civil justice system has real problems. If I could go back to the question that Justice Alito asked earlier with respect to the allegations that are listed in those pages, you know, the thing that I wanted to make clear with respect to the settlement and that I was making clear with respect to the time period covered by the complaint, which is 2008 to February 2015, is that the carriage by AT&T and DirecTV, which are probably the largest in the country, 25 million or so, is -- post-dates the events in the complaint. And so that the allegations in the current operative complaint with respect to demand that they can show by reference to this carriage is one that was by dint of a settlement that was entered during the pendency of this litigation. We ask for judicial notice, again, of the fact that these complaints were all pending in the Central District of California, and this probably had some bearing on the fact that Judge Hatter, who didn't just fall off the turnip truck, granted our motion to dismiss. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-260, the County of Maui versus the Hawaii Wildlife Fund. Mr. Lin. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not about whether the releases from Maui's underground injection wells should be regulated at all but how.
They are already regulated under several existing state and federal environmental programs, including the Clean Water Act's nonpoint source program. But is a Clean Water Act point source permit also required? The question is where the line falls between the Clean Water Act's federal point source program and its state law nonpoint source program. And the answer is in the text.
The text defines a point source as a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, and it thereby makes clear that the trigger for point source permitting is not where a pollutant comes from but how it reaches navigable waters. An NPDES permit is thus required only when a point source or series of point sources is the means of delivering pollutants to navigable waters.
This understanding is confirmed by the fact that it offers the predictability one would expect in a permitting regime, where regulated entities need to know beforehand whether a permit is required and where, in this particular statute, penalties for noncompliance are so severe. It also maintains an important role for state nonpoint source programs under the Clean Water Act. Respondents, however, would rewrite the statute to all but eviscerate the line between point and nonpoint source pollution and radically change the status quo.
In this case, they would impose a new federal permit on wells that have operated the same way for 40 years, during which time EPA expressly rejected calls for NPDES permitting.
There are more than 500,000 similar underground injection wells in the country and nearly 6,000 in Hawaii alone. This expansion of the nonpoint source program and diminution of the -- excuse me, this expansion of the point source program and diminution of the nonpoint source program is not warranted by the text, as is underscored by the fact that Respondents now offer the fourth different reading of the statute to support liability in this case. Counsel, I -- I want to make sure I understand what your test is.
You say that the -- it has to be the means -- I guess the point source has to be the means of conveyance to the jurisdictional water? Yes, Your Honor. What does that mean? That if it ever runs into groundwater, it is not the means of conveyance but the groundwater is? That's correct, Your Honor. The -- what we mean by ""means of conveyance"" is at the point source.
The discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance must carry and deliver the pollutant to the navigable waters. So the -- so any intervention of groundwater removes the jurisdiction of the point source program? That's right, because groundwater is a nonpoint source.
And if the groundwater is -- in this case is diffusely flowing through the ground and that's what carries the pollutants to the navigable waters -- But the well -- the well is the source of the pollution, so it would seem that that should be the object of regulation.
And it is a conveyance.
It is one of two conveyances in this case.
But it is a means of delivery, although the groundwater is also a means of delivery. Yes, Your Honor, the wells are a point source, and we don't dispute that it is a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, but not all point sources require point source permits. If that were the case, as Respondents suggest, there would be very, very little, if anything, left for nonpoint source regulation. And so our contention, Your Honor, is that if you're reading the statutory text and considering the words ""addition from any point source,"" that that contemplates that the point source must be the thing or point sources must together -- as one functional point source must be what actually delivers the pollutants to the -- So if -- I guess I -- So, if you have a point source under pressure that, you know, just -- that doesn't seep up, kind of shoots the pollutants out, and there, you know, that motion gets to the jurisdictional water, would that be covered? Would that be pollution of the jurisdictional water by that point source? It -- I'm envisioning two different things, one where it's -- the pollutant is put in the groundwater and then gradually, you know, seeps into the -- into the ocean, and one where it's sort of forcefully expelled, although it goes through the groundwater. Your Honor, I think if it still goes through the groundwater, the -- the question under the statute is what is the -- what is the conveyance, what is the thing that carries and delivers the pollutants.
I think even if it's forcefully put into the groundwater, the groundwater is what's carrying it. Now I can imagine, Your Honor, scenarios as we discuss in our brief where you've got, say, a point source, a pipe that's very close to the water's edge and -- and expels the pollutants into the water.
The thing that's carrying it, the last conveyance in that factual scenario, would be the pipe.
The pipe is a discernible, confined, and discrete -- So what happens if you just take the pipe and you decide what we'll do is we're going to end the pipe 35 feet from the river or from the ocean or something? Now you know perfectly well that it'll drip down into the ground and it'll be carried out into the navigable water. In your theory, that isn't covered? In that scenario, Your Honor, the land is the conveyance and that pollution would be regulated under the nonpoint source -- Well, no, the conveyance is the groundwater that is underneath the land into which the pipe drips the pollutant. Yes, Your Honor.
If it seeps into the ground -- Yeah. -- then the groundwater is what's carrying and delivering the pollutants -- Yeah. -- and that scenario would be regulated under the nonpoint source program. The Congress -- All right, but then what we have is, I take it, an absolute road map for people who want to avoid the point source regulation.
All we do is we just cut off the -- cut off the -- the pipes or whatever, five feet from the ocean or five feet from the navigable stream or five feet from -- you see? You understand the problem. What I'm looking for in this case is what's a standard that will prevent evasion, which I'm not -- I don't see how yours prevents evasion. Your Honor -- And at the same time doesn't turn everything into -- undercut the groundwater program. If I may, I would quarrel with your use of the word ""evasion,"" because I think what's important to remember is it's a comprehensive scheme.
Congress didn't design a -- it didn't just put the point source program out into the world on a hope and a prayer that there would be some other regulatory program that would cover the other scenarios, including the one that you're talking about, Justice Breyer. There -- there is a nonpoint source program.
There are laws, including in Hawaii, that would explicitly prohibit the scenario that you're talking about.
Hawaii Code 354D -- three -- 354D-50, it says that you can't alter the way your -- your -- your discharge system is structured without permission from the director of -- But Congress -- -- the Hawaii -- Excuse me, Mr. Lin. Congress wanted the point source program to do something.
The Congress wanted point sources that were discharging pollutants to receive a permit before they did so.
And I think what Justice Breyer is saying is that nobody would ever have to go through that process of getting a permit if they knew that they could do something like what Justice Breyer was suggesting, just stop the pipe five feet before the ocean. And I think, Your Honor, the key there is that they knew they could.
And ""could"" -- ""could"" is the operative word because the state law regulations that are in place are significant.
And so it's a -- it's a -- yes, Your Honor, there's a clear choice that our reading of the statute offers, which is, do you want to be subject to permitting or subject to state law regulation? And state law regulation in many, many states, including Hawaii, doesn't allow the scenario that -- But that's the problem -- -- Justice Breyer is talking about. -- but that's the problem, isn't it? Because it presumes the state will regulate, and some states don't.
So what you're doing is cutting off permitting because you're limiting the word ""to"" -- or -- or morphing the word ""to navigable waters"" and changing it into ""into navigable waters."" And that's what Justice Scalia looked at was the plain text and said ""to"" is different than ""into."" And so, for us, the question, I believe, is, do you read the plain language and does it say from a point source, it's the well, to the ocean? It can be traced, yes.
I think the words are pretty clear. A few -- To accept yours, you have to put in the word ""into."" A few answers to that, Your Honor. To -- to -- to accept your meaning, we have to transform ""in"" into ""into."" If I may, let me turn first to the question of states and whether states would regulate. So I think the answer to your question is, could there -- could there be states that would simply allow this to be a wild west, where there's no regulation of nonpoint source pollution? And the answer to that is absolutely not. There's a couple reasons why that's not true.
First, 1329 of the Clean Water Act requires every state to have a nonpoint source management program. Second, there are grants and incentives in place, hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to encourage states to regulate. And, third, there are water -- there's a water quality back-stop in the Clean Water Act, so any water, states are required every two years to identify waters that are impaired, that are not meeting water quality standards -- But, Mr. Lin -- -- that have -- -- the question is what this statute means.
The question is not whether there's a possible state back-stop.
The question is what Congress was doing in this statute. And Justice Sotomayor indicated to you that this statute reads pretty firmly.
It requires a permit when there's any addition of any pollutants to navigable waters from any point source. So, here, it's from a point source, which is the well, and it's to navigable waters, which is the ocean, and it's an addition.
How does this statute not apply? Your Honor, I think it comes down to what -- what work is ""from"" doing in the statute.
And ""from"" is a preposition, as this Court has recognized, for other prepositions, like ""under."" It -- it takes its meaning from the words that are around it.
And the words here that ""from"" is indicating the relationship between are ""addition"" and ""point source."" Now, if ""point source"" were not a defined term, which is what my friends here urge, and you looked at simply the ordinary meaning of the word ""source,"" I think we would have -- be having a very different discussion, but ""point source"" is defined as a conveyance. Well, it's defined as more than a conveyance.
Conveyance is the umbrella term.
But then, actually, they go further and they say that there are particular things that are point sources, some of which sound like conveyances and some of which, quite frankly, don't. Nobody ever thought that a container sounded like a conveyance.
Nobody ever thought that a concentrated animal feeding operation sounded like a conveyance.
And, most importantly here, nobody really thinks that a well sounds much like a conveyance. But ""well"" is specifically defined to be a point source.
This is a well.
So you can read this -- this provision that I just read you, and the addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any well.
That's what we have here. Your Honor, if I could start with the statutory language, I think the wells as an example is important to address, but if you -- I think if you look at the words ""addition from any point source,"" and you substitute in, for point source, pipe, which is in the statute and nobody disagrees is a -- is a point source, addition to a lake, to an ocean, to a river, a navigable water, an addition to a lake of pollutants from a pipe, addition to a lake of sewage water from a pipe. I think, I submit, Your Honor, that the ordinary understanding of that, what one pictures in one's mind is a pipe that is next to the water, not a pipe that is a mile away.
And I think that's because you're talking about in addition, which is a verb that just has -- That -- -- delivery -- yes, Your Honor? Keep going. Sorry. -- that has delivery in it and it's -- it's being associated with conveyance, which is a thing that transports, carries, and delivers. That sounds like the directly argument that Justice Scalia's opinion rejected. Yes, Your Honor.
I -- the Rapanos plurality that Justice Scalia wrote, we think it's factually consistent with our reading.
We think he was concerned about point source to point source pollution.
But as to the textual argument -- Well, why -- why is point source to point source to navigable water covered and point source to nonpoint source to navigable water not covered? Textually, we think that point source to point source is covered because it is the phrase ""any point source,"" not the phrase ""a point source,"" that must be the means. And because ""any"" includes one or more, you could have more than one point source. And the only way more than one point source can -- where all of the point sources are carrying, delivering, is where they are integrated and operating as one point source. If -- if the word ""from"" -- suppose I think you have a strong argument on the word ""from,"" and so, too, does the opposing side have a strong argument on the ordinary meaning of the word ""from."" What then should we look at to help us decide how to interpret it? Your Honor, as this Court has said many times recently, you have to look at all the other tools of statutory -- And what -- -- interpretation. -- and what -- what are the best ones for you? A couple of them. Give me one or two that -- that you think are best for you. If I had to go with two, I would start with structure, the fact that nobody disputes that there should be a point source program and a nonpoint source program, and that their reading renders the nonpoint source program, by their own admission, into a residuum, whereas ours leaves a meaningful role for the nonpoint source program. The second tool of statutory interpretation, Your Honor, is to look at the context and the other provisions, including the punitive provisions, which, as this Court has recognized, impose civil penalties of more -- of more than $50,000 a day. We're talking about a permitting regime.
And what would we have expected Congress to have written? Something that requires an after-the-fact analysis of traceability or something that could be determined ahead of time by mere observation, that there is here a discernible and confined, discrete conveyance that is delivering the pollutants to the water.
I need to go get a permit. The term ""from"" could be read very broadly to mean that a discharge requires a permit if the pollutant emerges at some point from a point source and by some means, no matter how remote, some quantity of the pollutant eventually makes its way into the waters of the United States. Now I take it that interpretation which Respondents once advocated is no longer their position.
So what concerns me is whether there is any limiting principle that can be found in the text and is workable and does not lead to absurd results. Your Honor, I think the limiting principle is the means of delivery test, which is that you -- that -- that what Congress wanted regulated entities and regulators and courts to look at is, how is the pollutant reaching the navigable water? Is it a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance? Now that is a case-by-case factual determination and there are lines that need to be drawn, but we think in the overwhelming majority of cases it's going to be clear. Your Honor, in terms of whether ""from"" could be more broadly read, I think, yes, if the statute were written differently, if it said, for example, emitted from a point source, that might be a different case. What about the limiting principle that the Respondents now propose, which is that it has to be fairly traceable and there has to be proximate causation and, therefore, foreseeability, is -- can that be found in the text and is it workable? Your Honor, we don't think it can be found in the text because we don't read ""from"" -- we don't think Congress intended ""from"" to mean causation.
So, one, we don't think it can be found in the text.
Two -- But that would be a normal way of reading the word ""from,"" wouldn't it; in other words, to say, to decide whether something is from something else, you have to look as to whether it's from something else? (Laughter.) Your Honor, if I may. Yes. Your Honor, with respect, I think it -- it -- that assumes that a certain kind of word is following from.
If you said, for example, Your Honor, this arrived from Miami, Miami is a place of origin, and so, yes, ""from"" is indicating the source, the place where that started. But, if you said this arrived today from a truck, I posit, Your Honor, I submit that truck is being used as a conveyance there.
It's not necessarily the point of origin. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The first point I'd like to make about the -- the definition of discharge of a pollutant is that the combination of the words ""to"" and ""from"" import more than either term in isolation; that the statute defines the term ""discharge of a pollutant"" to mean any addition of a pollutant to navigable waters or to the ocean from a point source. And, for example, if at my home I pour whiskey from a bottle into a flask and then I bring the flask to a party at a different location and I pour whiskey into the punch bowl there, nobody would say that I had added whiskey to the punch from the bottle. It would be true that the punch -- that the whiskey originated in the bottle, its route was fairly traceable from the bottle to the punch bowl, and it wound up in the punch bowl, but you wouldn't say it was added to the punch from the bottle. Now, at the other extreme, if I brought the bottle to the party and I poured it, the whiskey from a few inches above the surface of the punch and so it traveled through air or if it traveled through a funnel so it passed over a solid surface, in ordinary parlance, we wouldn't say that simply because there was some spatial gap between the bottle and the punch, therefore, I didn't add it from the -- the bottle to -- to the punch. In between those two extremes, I don't think that the ""to"" and ""from"" will get you all the way home.
I think the Court needs to look at other provisions of the Clean Water Act to determine what sort of break in the chain will cause the -- the -- the release no longer to be a discharge from the point source to the navigable waters. But the fairly traceable test that the Ninth Circuit adopted just can't be right.
It would encompass -- you know, if transmuted over to the whiskey example, it would encompass situations where I poured the whiskey from the bottle into the flask.
Nobody would treat that as addition of the whiskey to the punch from the bottle. Now, with respect to groundwater in particular, the reason that EPA has concluded that groundwater in particular will break the causal chain so that it will no longer be an addition from the point source to the navigable water, groundwater is really treated in the Clean Water Act as its own thing, and in large part, that's because of its distinct physical characteristics, but there's a body of both state and federal law that regulates groundwater specifically, in part to protect the drinking water supply because groundwater is obviously important for that, in part because of potential downstream effects on the quality of navigable waters. And in -- in your test, any little bit of groundwater is enough to break the chain? Yes.
Now -- now the hypothetical -- Yes.
I mean -- okay.
So two inches? Two inches.
But the -- the hypothetical in which somehow the pollutant will be released from a pipe and will travel through two inches of groundwater but won't travel over land doesn't seem realistic.
That is, if you imagine a pipe releasing pollutants five feet from the shore and some of -- What's the difference between the groundwater and the land? The big difference is that groundwater -- The land is not a conveyance. The -- the -- the big -- the big difference for purposes of applying the statute is that the land is not -- the land right next to the bank is not subject to its own body of distinct federal and state regulation in the way that groundwater is. Why -- Sorry, Mr. Stewart, I didn't get the idea of your -- what -- what do you say to the hypothetical, which is the pipe goes five feet to the shore? If it goes five feet to the shore and the pollutant travels onto the land, travels across the land and into the water, you know, through its own force, it spews out of the pipe or simply through the force of gravity because you're on an incline, we would say that's covered. So, if the pipe is on the -- is on the land and spews onto the land, it's regulated and you need a permit; but, if the pipe is underground, it's not and you don't need a permit? You would not need a -- you would not need a NPDES permit because you would not be discharging onto -- you would not be discharging to the navigable water -- It's the same problem. But just to follow up with Justice Breyer's -- Justice Breyer said that this was a road map.
I guess you said the hypothetical is -- is -- is not realistic.
But why isn't it realistic? You've just provided a road map.
You know, put your pipe underground. Well, I think if you were going to -- to do it in the form of a well or do it in the form of a contraption that had the physical consequences of a well, that is, you were injecting pollutants into the groundwater from the surface, you would be subject to this distinct body of regulation. The Clean Water Act requires states that want to implement their own -- to administer their own NPDES programs to regulate disposals into wells.
The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates disposals into wells that will affect drinking water quality. So I don't think that the potential for evasion is -- The problem I see is that all those other statutes have different focuses.
So you look at CERCLA or OPA, they're remedial.
They're after the fact.
This statute is preventative.
We want to avoid having to clean it up.
That's why we give a permit. And I don't see many of the other statutes you cited in your brief as really addressing that significant problem, which is the preventive issue.
And so there is a purpose to the permit. There's -- It's the only one that serves that permit -- that purpose. I guess I'd say a couple of things.
And the first point I would make is to -- to refer to what Mr. Lin was saying during the -- the earlier part of the argument about nonpoint source pollution and the fact that the Clean Water Act has a robust body of law that encourages states to develop effective programs for combating nonpoint source solution. But that's -- that's -- It -- -- one manner of curing the problem.
The other is to not exempt groundwater.
They exempted a whole series of other means of delivery, but they chose not to exempt groundwater. It's -- it's simply illustrative of the fact that the NPDES program is not intended as a cure-all.
It's not intended to deal with every form of activity that might ultimately result in -- Well, that's true, Mr. Stewart, and -- and -- and nobody's saying that the federal government can go in and start regulating groundwater as groundwater.
And, likewise, nobody's saying that it can go in and start regulating nonpoint sources as nonpoint sources. But, here, the question is the pollution is coming from a point source, an undisputed point source, and going into the navigable water, and the only question is whether the fact that there's some kind of intermediary between the two, even, you know -- and Mr. Lin says some kind of intermediary; you say ground, underground -- whether that makes a difference. The -- the -- the point of this regulation is to go at the source, and the source is still -- is a point source regulated -- emitting pollutants. Yeah -- It leaves -- I guess what I'm saying is this leaves a very large sphere of activity that the federal government is still not touching.
All it's doing is insisting that when the federal government permitting program applies to point sources, it applies to those point sources regardless of whether it goes two inches underground. I -- I guess the other thing I would say is when -- when we're distinguishing between nonpoint source and point source pollution, we are at least in general looking at the means by which the pollutants are conveyed into -- to the waters. And so, for example, if you apply fertilizer to your lawn and a rainstorm comes and the fertilizer is washed into a nearby river, the -- the contraption that you use to apply the fertilizer might fit the statutory definition of a point source, but that would still be treated as nonpoint source pollution. It would be what they refer to sometimes as -- as sheet flow, unchannelized rainwater that washes into a navigable water.
So -- Mr. Stewart, Justice Breyer has been trying gamely -- I'm sorry. -- to question you. I'm sorry. Just if you have a reaction to this.
If I don't accept -- I'm not saying -- but if I don't accept because I think these two programs are quite different, ground source and point source, different purposes, et cetera, and I'm worried about the evasion or area, you see, that we talked about first. So it seems to me this case, in my mind at the moment, is what's the standard for separating the sheep from the goats? And you're basically saying the Ninth Circuit's way too broad and so are they, so we come up with zero, okay? Close to zero. Now the best -- I want to try out one thing, if you think -- have any reaction to it. If it's -- it's regulated or under this, if it's the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Now the reason that I put that is because that leaves a lot of room for the EPA to write regulations, to decide what is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge.
And it's narrower than the Ninth Circuit.
You want to -- if you have to have a reaction to that, have it. I mean, I -- I guess the reason I'm skeptical of that from our point of view is I think the people -- without further guidance from the Court, I think the people on the other side of the case and their amici would say, if it can be shown that the pollutants that were released from the point source ultimately wound up in the navigable waters, then it is the functional equivalent. Then what we do is we -- basically, it would be up to the EPA, policed by the courts, to see that they've come up with a -- a reasonable decision, consistent with the basic objectives of the statute, dah-dah-dah, okay? So we don't know exactly what the -- you see the point. Yes.
May I? I guess part of -- obviously, if we had rule-making authority and could -- could flesh that out, it would be helpful.
I still have concerns about any approach that could be interpreted as saying if the pollutants make it to the navigable water, then it's covered. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Henkin. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Clean Water Act prohibits unpermitted additions of pollutants to navigable waters from any point source.
This prohibition is not limited to pollutants that flow directly from a point source to navigable waters.
The word ""directly"" is nowhere in the text. Rather, all that's required is that the pollutants be from a point source.
The Act expressly defines ""point source"" to include wells, and the common use of ""from"" is to indicate the starting point, cause, or source of something.
When you buy groceries, you say they came from the store, not from your car, even though that's the last place they were before they entered your house. Likewise, the millions of gallons of treated sewage entering the Pacific Ocean off West Maui every day come from Petitioner's wells under any understanding of the term. For three decades, EPA interpreted the Clean Water Act prohibition this way.
In all that time, the parade of horribles Petitioner imagines never happened because applying the prohibition isn't nearly as complicated as Petitioner suggests. Consider three scenarios.
First, in cases like this one, large quantities of pollutants in navigable waters are easily traced upstream to the point source discharger who should have gotten a permit. Second, it generally is impossible to trace small amounts of pollutants to an individual point source, so the prohibition doesn't apply. Third, when small amounts of pollution are traceable to an individual source, EPA and states can adopt general permits to reduce the regulatory burden.
General permits cover entire classes of discharges, like stormwater from construction sites and spraying pesticides, and allow the discharges as long as you meet the permit's requirements. Applying the Clean Water Act as written protects our nation's waters and does not impose a significant burden on small dischargers. By contrast, as this panel -- as this Court has noted, Petitioner's test would enable large-scale polluters to evade the law just by pulling their pipes back a few feet to the water's edge, or, as EPA now agrees, by pointing them underground, as Petitioner did here, using the groundwater as a sewer to pollute navigable waters. There's no question that polluters would do exactly that.
As discussed in the brief of the State of Maryland, recently, a silver mine in Colorado tried to cancel its NPDES permit simply by pulling its pipe out of the neighboring creek and sticking it into the groundwater. Well, that's the extreme problem on the other side.
But, to the extreme issue on your side, what is the limiting principle? As far as I understand, once you get the pollutant into groundwater, I mean, groundwater goes into the ocean, so if you get it into groundwater, it's -- it's covered by the permit? Mr. Chief Justice, the limiting principles would be traceability and proximate cause. All right. Now traceability is a technological issue because we know that the water, including the pollutants, has gotten to whatever it is, the ocean or something, whatever the jurisdictional water is.
It's just a question of how sophisticated the instruments are that can trace it.
And I don't know.
I don't know exactly how far, how fast the groundwater is going.
So -- so that doesn't seem to me to be a -- a significant limitation. And what was the other one that you mentioned? Proximate cause, which comes from the notion of -- of this is -- this is -- this statute regulates behavior that causes something.
It's the addition of pollutants to navigable waters from a point source, and ""from"" has the meaning of a cause. So -- Well, proximate cause is notoriously manipulable. What -- give me an example where you think there would be an intervening cause, where you have, in addition to the groundwater, the groundwater eventually makes it to the ocean, but there's an intervening cause. Well, for example, if someone is discharging into an injection well, they've got a Safe Drinking Water Act permit and that permit told them that this groundwater doesn't go anywhere.
It's isolated.
It's -- No, I'm looking for a limited principle when the groundwater does go to jurisdictional waters. Well, proximate cause cuts off factual causation when it's -- it's too attenuated.
And so the case -- there was a case, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, in which EPA made a finding that, where there was evidence that discharges from a mine would enter groundwater, and it would take 60 to, I believe, 400 years to get to a navigable water, and the time that it did that, it would be de minimis, the amounts, and EPA determined that that was -- that cut off the causal chain. Now we're not suggesting -- What -- -- it needs to go -- -- what about -- -- as far as that -- -- what about the Fourth Circuit test? I take it you are advancing the Ninth Circuit fairly traceable test.
But the Fourth Circuit test, which I'm not sure I comprehend it, is direct hydrological connection.
What's the difference between those two? Justice Ginsburg, in our view, our test is narrower.
Direct hydrologic connection is the test that EPA and -- and -- and states had applied for three decades until EPA changed its position in April. And that looks mainly at the -- the -- the facts on the ground, the factual hydrologic connections.
And so that would be the traceability I was discussing with -- with the Chief Justice. We bound that factual causation, so even if there is causation in fact, the law when you're looking at holding people responsible for what they caused, will -- will not always hold them legally responsible if it's -- if it's not foreseeable, if it's too attenuated, if it's too remote. Is there an example -- I'm not sure I really see much of a distinction between the direct hydrological connection or a hydrological connection and what you're -- and what you're advocating. Let's take the example of a wastewater treatment facility.
Can you think of any situation in which there is traceability -- and I don't know what the difference is between fairly traceable and unfairly traceable, but put that aside -- when -- when it's traceable, but it wouldn't be foreseeable? No, Justice Alito.
I think with the wastewater treatment plant, I would find it hard to think of a situation in which a wastewater treatment plant, which is designed to dispose of, not to store, but to dispose in this case of millions of gallons of treated sewage every day, when they designed this facility back in 1973, a decade before putting it into operation, they knew what they were doing. They drilled -- this is not a case in which we have percolation down through the soil eventually getting into groundwater.
They drilled these injection wells directly into the groundwater, expressly for the purpose of conveying it to the ocean -- Okay.
So that's this facility.
Let's take an example of the ordinary family out in the country that has a septic tank, and they buy it from somebody who installs them and they get the building permit that's required by that rural municipality. And then it turns out that some of -- some things are leaching out of the septic tank 10 years later and making its way into waters of the United States. So they would be violating -- they would be violating the Clean Water Act for lack of a permit and would be subject to all the penalties that go with that for every day of the violation? Well, Justice Alito, if I understand your hypothetical correctly, at the time that they purchased the house, they had no reason to believe that any pollutants would be getting to the ocean. And that would be a reasonable assumption for a homeowner because septic tanks, as both, I think, the homeowners brief -- or the National Home Builders brief, as well as Anderson County brief point out, the reason that we have these types of regulations locally has nothing to do with the Clean Water Act. It's so that a septic tank is properly installed and it's going to use the ground as a treatment system, but it doesn't even pollute groundwater, much less any down -- Well, what -- I mean, what if they buy it from -- and they don't have a lot of money and so they shop around and they buy it from the lowest cost provider and the lowest cost installer -- and then, if it turns out, well, it should have been foreseeable that because you bought this from this cheap outfit that there was going to be a problem, that would be a violation? Well -- well, fortunately, Justice Alito, it's -- it's a -- it's a highly regulated thing, a septic tank. And so they not only need to get a purveyor, but they're going to have to follow the rules of the locality in the state. So I have personal -- But -- but -- -- experience with this because I built a house -- -- but, counsel -- -- and I had to put in a septic tank. -- could you just answer Justice Alito's question? I'd be grateful if you would.
I mean, there are other regulations for nonpoint sources as well and for -- for septic tanks, but, under the foreseeability test or traceability test that you're proposing, why wouldn't the septic tank that foreseeably, objectively, it's not their personal, right, you don't want a subjective test, you want an objective test? Correct, Your Honor. So all that talk about what they personally think is irrelevant. Why -- why aren't they liable under your test? Well, Justice Gorsuch, if -- if -- if a reasonable person in the position of the homeowner would have no reason to believe the septic tank is going to get to navigable waters, the pollutants from the septic tank, they wouldn't be held liable.
And in addition, the reason -- Well, again, we're positing -- I think you're fighting the hypothetical, and one -- you know, I'll give it one more shot. Oh -- You know, that -- that -- that you've got great proof because water runs downhill, and gravity tends to work its wonders with water, and that the snow in the Rockies tends to wind up in the Mississippi River, and that this septic tank happens to be built pretty close to a navigable river, and it was put in by a shoddy installer, or whatever facts you have that are objective.
Forget about the homeowner's subjective intentions. You're going to have a pretty good case, let's posit, hypothetically, that it was foreseeable that this septic tank -- and we might put in San Francisco's green water treatment plants and a whole lot else -- are foreseeable and they're going to wind up in the waters of the United States. What -- what limiting principle do you have to offer the Court? Well, you also have the concept of traceability.
So usually, when you have one septic tank, you have more, and so just because you find pollutants in the water doesn't mean you know which one it's from. The definition of ""point source"" includes, as its first term, discernible.
And so that's why the point source program focuses on whether you have a discernible point source. You're trying with this.
You're trying with this.
But, look, I learned in the eighth grade, and it may be wrong, that water does run downhill -- (Laughter.) -- and that virtually every little drop of rain that falls finds its way to the sea.
And -- and that's an overstatement but not too much.
So it's not just the septic tank; the miner gets up and every morning he throws his shaving water outside the house at Mount -- at Pikes Peak, okay? Now there's a very good chance that that will end up in a river, and your brief, the brief on the -- of the scientists, really convinced me they're geniuses and they can trace all kinds of things. So the problem that I saw, that I think we're all saying with the traceability test is I've overstated it but not by too much, and, therefore, it puts all kinds of people in the position of having to get a permit.
Have you ever tried to do that? That's a big complicated thing, okay? So we're looking, at least I am, for something not quite as broad as traceability but something that doesn't run into the problems that you properly point out. So all kinds of things -- I mean, that's why I put this functional equivalent of a direct discharge which imposes some kind of limit on the EPA.
They can write -- this is for them.
They should write rules, okay? But traceability and causation.
There we are, every little drop of rain.
I mean, you know. Well, Justice Breyer, we believe that the way the statute is written, that traceability and proximate cause was a fair reading of the plain language of the statute. But the question presented to the Court is simply whether the mere fact that discharges that, concededly, are from a point source reach a navigable water through some distance of groundwater, whether that cuts off Clean Water Act liability. The answer to that is clearly no, because -- All right.
Clearly no. And -- But we have to write an opinion.
And in writing the opinion -- Yes. -- I think we're going to have to have a standard.
And I don't just look at the language.
That's very important, the language. Yes. But I am worried about 500 million people or something suddenly discovering that they have to go apply for a permit for the EPA. And -- and -- Now traceability and causation don't quite seem to do it.
So I wonder if you have any sort of fall-back position there that -- that would cure my worry without getting into the evasion problems. Well, Justice Breyer, we could certainly embrace functional equivalent, because there's no question that Congress intended to regulate discharges whether it goes through the air.
Now everyone -- everyone here agrees that the air is not a point source, but everyone also agrees if the point source discharges into the river, through the air, it's covered. We and the United States agree that if it also flows over the land, which is also not covered by the Clean Water Act, it's covered. And I would -- I would -- I would submit that there's nothing in the language of the statute that exempts point source discharge just because it touches a little bit of groundwater. Congress could have done that.
There are a number -- as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, there are a number of enumerated exemptions in the Clean Water Act for things that would otherwise be point source discharges.
So directly in the definition of point source, you exclude things like agricultural return -- irrigation return flows and agricultural stormwater. Well, I -- Then you turn -- -- don't -- I don't mean to be critical of the author of the phrase, but what does ""functional equivalent"" mean? (Laughter.) What do you understand it to mean? I mean, the -- what we're looking for -- as for an equivalent, it's an equivalent to a point source, right? Which is -- Right. Okay.
I -- I think of a pipe. Yes. Well, what's the functional equivalent of a pipe when you're talking about groundwater? Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case, when Petitioner was designing their wastewater treatment plant -- and I should mention in Miccosukee, this Court emphasized that applying NPDES permits to -- to wastewater -- municipal wastewater treatment plants is really what Congress was all about in enacting the law in 1972, when, I also might add, there was no Safe Drinking Water Act -- Well, but that's -- -- in 1972. -- that's a big wind-up.
The question is -- Yes. -- what's the functional -- what's a functional equivalent? The -- when they were planning this, they thought about doing ocean outfall and they said no, we can dispose of it just as well through injection wells.
That's the functional equivalent from the -- the question is, do you have an identifiable point source and it's the same to the receiving body, water body, if you do it through the groundwater, over the ground, through the air, or directly into it. If the pollutants are getting into it, if there's an addition of pollutants, any addition of pollutants to the navigable water from an identifiable point source -- now these very remote -- I know it's -- I understand it's not your -- but it sounds an awful lot like as vague as fairly traceable.
If all of those things are functional -- it seems to me that your answer to me is that the functional equivalent is anything that gets to a jurisdictional water. It -- our -- that -- that -- I mean, that's why we suggest it as the test, that it would be traceable and so you would have causation in fact, and you would use principles of proximate cause, which this Court has embraced in other situations, like in the Endangered Species Act.
It prohibits -- it prohibits take of endangered species through inhabit modification. Don't worry, he'll have an opportunity, because you didn't make this phrase up. (Laughter.) And -- and it's a little bit -- and we do have -- we do discuss these things.
So -- so we will discuss them. (Laughter.) I -- I was looking for something, which I'm not wedded to the one I said, but I'm looking for something that does give the EPA some leeway on this but doesn't go as far as what traceability and causation do, which seem to say the sky's the limit. And -- and that -- that's -- that's what I'm looking for.
Now I think functional equivalent might or might not, but that's for -- a matter for us to discuss, I think.
Your initial reaction was a little narrower, not too bad.
I don't know what theirs is, but -- but I'm not wedded to it. Well, Justice Breyer, I think ultimately the question before the Court, the question presented, is whether or not mere passage through a little bit of groundwater cuts off Clean Water Act liability. On that -- Mr. Henkin, could -- maybe I don't understand the science of this and perhaps like scientists can do everything.
But wouldn't the question for these sort of septic tank examples be that your traceability requirement has to be that you look at the ocean and you find these pollutants in the ocean, and you have to say these pollutants came from a particular place -- Yeah. -- could you say that as to a septic tank? No, in -- in our view, Justice Kagan, you -- you normally could not.
I mean, if there's only one septic tank -- if you're in an area where there's just one septic tank and you found fecal coliform or something that's indicative of a septic tank, you might be able to do that.
But, normally, when I built my house, everyone was on septic tanks because the sewer didn't go out to where we live -- So you couldn't say -- -- and that's normally the situation. -- whether it's from your house or your house or your house or your house.
Now I suppose somebody could say, well, then you all have to get permits.
Is that right? Is that the way you understand the traceability requirement? Not at all.
Not at all. Not at all? So all you have to do is get a bunch of neighbors and all put the septic tanks in, and then you're scot free? If you -- if you cannot determine which point source, if it's not an identifiable point source to control, so you don't know -- you don't who's doing it, then that is -- that is archetypal nonpoint source pollution.
So if -- Okay.
So you're saying if -- if it's one house, one septic tank, that person will need a permit.
If it's a residential development and you have 100 septic tanks, which would seem to me to be 100 times worse, they don't need a permit. If you don't know which house might have a septic tank that has -- that was poorly installed that didn't follow -- you know, they didn't follow the rules or had some aberration of geology such that it would be polluting the ocean, you -- I mean, I would think that that's -- -- didn't know which one it was. -- a usual thing in law, right? Like, you can't hold somebody responsible for somebody -- Yeah. -- for something unless you knew that they were responsible for that thing. Absolutely correct. And -- and if there are 20 other people who could be responsible for that thing, then you can't hold them responsible for that thing, can you? That's absolutely correct. So, here, we don't -- So if you have 20 people -- -- here, we don't have that problem. It's an Agatha Christie novel.
You have 20 people and they all shoot the gun at the guy at the same time. (Laughter.) They're all -- no one's guilty? But that's tort law, right? Maybe if we could -- (Laughter.) Mr. Henkin? I would be curious what counsel thinks about that. Mr. Henkin, you have been asked in various forms the question that was put in the reply brief on page 11, and it is: Would you require permits for a toilet, an identifiable point source, that originates wastewater and foreseeably sends it to the county's wells? So how do you answer that? Justice Ginsburg, we would not hold them responsible for a different reason.
I think that Petitioner would hold them responsible because a toilet could be a point source that goes into a pipe and it goes into a waste treatment plant that goes into a pipe and then goes into ocean outfall.
That's point source to point source to point source.
And, eventually, they would hold the toilet flusher liable, perhaps, under their theory. But, fortunately, Congress, in promulgating the Clean Water Act, provides specifically for people flushing their toilet, that if it goes to a wastewater treatment plant and it's not a hazardous waste that you're flushing down the toilet, there's no pretreatment standard and you don't need to get a permit.
So that specific example, Congress dealt with. And that -- that's an important part of the statute, which is Congress, when it wanted to exempt things from point source control, it carved out -- On your -- -- specific exceptions. -- on your -- can I go back to your colloquy with the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan? Because it seems to me that's one of the contextual points that the other side points up here. You make a good argument about the word ""from"" in the text.
The other side has its responses.
And to figure out how to interpret that, one of the things they say we should look at is structure, and another thing is context. And on the context, the things they point out -- and I want you to give you -- have a chance to respond -- are this would be a massive increase in the permitting program, they say; the costs of permitting are high, they say, and I think you agree with that when you have to get a permit. And the uncertainty about when and whether you would need to get a permit, which I think is the colloquy you had with the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan, as well as transforming the federal/state balance.
So those are the contextual points that they raise to help us figure out this interesting and difficult question about the text. And I'll give you a chance to respond to those contextual points because that's what's bothering me. Okay.
Justice Kavanaugh, with respect to the issue of whether it would be a massive expansion, we -- the Court has -- benefits here from 30 years of experience.
This is not a new test that was articulated by the court below. But EPA for 30 years consistently said, and implementing states consistently followed, that discharges that reach navigable water via groundwater require a permit.
And everyone under the sun has not required a permit. With respect to, I mean, they mention something like half a million injection wells. Well, injection wells, to get -- they're on that list from the EPA because they got a UIC permit, an injection control permit. And in doing that, they had to look at the hydrology of -- of the situation.
And you'd know a lot about whether or not you were likely to pollute a navigable water. And -- and -- and cited particularly in the EPA official's brief, there is just a wealth of information there on permits that have been issued by EPA and states over these past 30 years for concentrated animal feeding operations, for wastewater treatment plants, that similar to theirs put -- Suppose I agree with you on this, just hypothetically, that EPA has been doing something like this and so it wouldn't be a massive increase.
So say you -- say I agree with you on that. Then I -- I do think the uncertainty point's a big point for you to deal with because you have to know in advance whether to get the permit or else you're going to be paying a huge amount at the back end. And so some clear line for the property owner, I think, is -- is really important here. Well, in -- in our perspective, specifically with individual homeowners and septic tanks, if your -- if you've installed your septic -- septic tank according to local ordinances and state regulation, which are intended to protect groundwater, you know, much less navigable waters, if it's not polluting the groundwater, it's certainly not polluting the navigable waters. If you complied with that, if you -- if you maintain it properly, you have -- objectively, you have no reason to believe that it's polluting the ocean, and so you would not have any foreseeability, any obligation to get a permit. In addition, if there was some aberrant situation -- You also don't want to be the subject of citizen suits, and so you would like that line not to be something that's objectively clear after a lot of litigation but objectively clear on the front end. Understood.
But Congress enacted the citizen suit provision at the same time as the Clean Water Act in 1972.
And I -- I'm not aware of any lawsuit against an individual septic tank owner for the violation, notwithstanding, again, a consistent interpretation up until April of this year by the Environmental Protection Agency that discharges via groundwater are covered. And the reason for that is, in order to establish traceability and foreseeability and all that, you need a big discharger like the Petitioner here.
You -- you've got millions of gallons per day in an intentionally designed facility. Congress did not intend to create a loophole.
I want to briefly address the United States' argument there's something about the structure of the Act, something special about groundwater. Well, nearly every provision that they cite that talks about these programs for groundwater in the same breath say and surface waters and navigable waters.
Congress treated them the same. And so, in the same way that those provisions don't exempt surface waters, waters of the United States, they don't exempt groundwater. Well, the Court has spoken about hiding elephants in mouse holes. Was groundwater an elephant at the time when the Clean Water Act was enacted? And, if it was, how do you account for the fact that there isn't any direct reference to it in the definition of a conveyance or any of the other provisions that are directly relevant here? Well, Justice Alito, there's no reference in any of the NPDES permitting program or the definition of a point source to regulating discharges via air, yet Petitioner concedes if the pipe is hanging over the water's edge, it can pass through air. The United States concedes -- I mean, do you think that that's really comparable, where you have a pipe that's over the river and the pollutant is coming out of the river and going through the air, that anybody's going to seriously argue that, well, because it went through the air, it wasn't covered? Do you really think that's comparable to groundwater that can travel a long distance? Well, Justice Alito, I could imagine a situation in which you have a pipe hanging out over the water and it's trickling into the water, and there's a strong wind, and every once in a while the trickle gets batted upon the shore. So that's not covered because it's now on the shore.
And then it's -- then the wind dies down and it goes into the water.
So there's really, you know, there's no difference in this situation. The same thing with respect to land. There's no reference to land in the NPDES permitting.
And -- and yet we can all conceive how it would create a -- a road map for evasion if you can cut your pipe five feet short of the shore line. Well, I don't know about that.
If you have a pipe that stops short of the water and you do that because you know that the pollutant, when it comes out of the pipe, is going to flow downhill into the river, I -- I don't know that you're going to be able to avoid the conclusion that whatever it is that takes it down that slope is a conveyance. Well, a conveyance has to be confined in some way.
So, for example, this wastewater treatment plant comes out at Kahekili Beach Park, which belongs to the county. So let's say instead they ran their discharge pipe to the beach park, they paved the land so it wouldn't create any furrow, any ditch, any -- any sheet flow that ran into the ocean.
But they would say it's nonpoint source pollution because it stops short of the water's edge. Now the United States would concede that that is covered, but if, instead of doing that, they went to the beach park and they put a lot of gravel down and they knew that it would run into the gravel and then, you know, go into the groundwater for like three inches before getting to the ocean itself, because the ocean, if you -- if you've been to the beach, you dig in the sand, you get down to water pretty quickly.
Well, that's groundwater, unless and until it's on the surface, and then it's the ocean. So, under the United States' theory, this -- this pipe that then goes into the sand and then goes through a very small stretch of groundwater, that's all of a sudden exempted. So, to use, you know, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart's example about the whiskey and the punch and the flask, and he said you would never say the whiskey that's in the punch came from the bottle, you'd say it came from the flask, well, here, Congress was trying to prohibit whiskey in punch. So if all of a sudden -- (Laughter.) -- you tasted the punch and you said this tastes like whiskey, you'd say, where did that come from? You wouldn't point to -- you'd say it came from the whiskey bottle.
That's how we know it's whiskey. And, here, we know we have whiskey, whiskey in the form of a injection well that is discharging 3 to 5 million gallons per day into the ocean. And there's nothing about the Clean Water Act that would allow a polluter to evade it by -- by -- by -- by pouring the whiskey via the groundwater. Well, I didn't know Mr. Stewart was spiking punch. (Laughter.) But would you say in his extent -- extend his example, that it came from a barrel in Scotland? Well, let's say the whiskey was spoiled in some way.
And I'm not a whiskey drinker and I don't mean to offend any whiskey drinkers.
But, if the whiskey were spoiled in some way, you might ask, where did this whiskey come from? And you might trace it back to the barrel in Scotland, particularly if it's poisonous or harmful in some way.
So it all depends on the context. What Congress wanted to do here was regulate pollution at the source when we can. And the source here clearly is their injection well. But -- but Congress knew about the ground -- groundwater issue and there were debates about this precise groundwater issue, maybe not this precise, but the groundwater issue, and there were proposals, as you're well aware, and some of the amicus briefs go through this at great length, to put in regulation of groundwater, and Congress rejected those. So how do we assess that in thinking about this? Well -- well, Justice Kavanaugh, those debates quite clearly resulted in a vote that said, we are not going to enact national standards to control the quality of groundwater.
So there is no regulation under the Clean Water Act of groundwater qua groundwater. And as I mentioned, in 1972, there was no -- So your point -- your point is that's a separate topic from the issue today? Absolutely.
And the same debates -- Okay. -- they said we recognize the essential link between ground and surface waters and the artificial nature of any distinction. If Congress had wanted to say point source discharge that reaches the navigable waters through groundwater is exempt, because we want to leave that completely to the states, they would have said that in the language of the Act.
They didn't.
In the same way that they said we don't want point source -- point source discharges that could be characterized as agricultural stormwater or irrigation return flows.
That usually happens in the form of a ditch. And they said we do not want to regulate that under the point source program. But, here, what you have is paradigmatic point source pollution that just happens to pass through -- Why -- why are the -- -- particularly for -- I'm sorry.
Why are the states inadequate to do this, and are they inadequately regulating in substantial numbers of states in your view? Well, I think the question, Justice Kavanaugh, is whether Congress intended to establish uniform -- No, I -- I understand your legal argument.
Just as a practical question, what's happening on the ground in the states, are they doing an inadequate job in substantial numbers in your view of regulating this substantial source of pollution? Please. Well, there are examples in the EPA official's brief in which delegated states are regulating those sources of pollution by using the NPDES permit program.
And -- and, as mentioned, Colorado pushed back against the mine owner that wanted to stop getting a permit by using the groundwater as a sewer to get pollutants into -- into the waters. But, ultimately, what we have is a -- is a statement by Congress that you need to have uniform regulation to protect our national waters, which are a national concern. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lin, three minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd just like to pick up where my friend left off, which is with the example of the Colorado DEQ and the footnote in Maryland's brief.
I think that is as, I thought I heard him say at the very end there, precisely an example of how the comprehensive regime works. The Colorado DEQ prohibited that mine from changing the way it was discharging pollutants in order to -- to use Justice Breyer's word -- evade its NPDES permit.
33 USC 1370, the Clean Water Act, allows states to impose stricter requirements on NPDES permits. And, of course, there -- Why are you doing what you're doing? This is fairly traceable to you in large quantities.
The state didn't control you.
What regulations are there in place that do? Your Honor, there are a number, starting with the -- No, no, you're doing it, what's stopping you from? This is not.
So how did you get away with it, and how do you continue without taking remedial steps? Your Honor, I don't think this is a question of -- Not you, but I mean the -- Of course, Your Honor.
I understand. -- I mean the -- the polluters.
What are they -- what is being done to stop them? Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I think, if I can take issue with the -- the -- the premise there, which is that there's something that's being gotten away with here, the -- If they followed -- -- these wells were -- -- all the laws, and they still are polluting, they're getting away with it.
So something failed. Your -- The preventive measures of this law were not followed and something failed. Your Honor, the -- the whole -- even under NPDES permits, point source discharges can include pollutants that are below effluent limits. So I think the -- the mere fact that there are -- are nutrients that are getting into the ocean doesn't mean that the system has failed. And I think it comes back to the fact that, in this particular circumstance, these wells were constructed with encouragement and funding from EPA as a more environmentally protective solution than simply constructing an outfall pipe to the ocean. If I can come back to the traceability point, I think it's also important to note, my friend runs very far away from the septic tank examples, and, Justice Kagan, to answer your question about traceability, there are 7,000 cesspools within 750 feet of the ocean in Hawaii, and we cite to a study in our reply brief that showed that through a tracer, dye tracer study, not dissimilar from what was used here, it was established that pollutants from individual septic tanks were getting to the ocean within three hours to five days. So traceability can be done.
Septic tanks are constructed near the ocean.
And I don't think that there is a limiting principle that would give those landowners any certainty, which comes back to the point which I think is the most important about predictability. And -- and, Justice Breyer, you had -- Why don't you finish your thought. -- you -- you had suggested functional equivalents.
I think it's important to remember the context that we're talking about here.
This is a -- a permitting program that applies to ordinary lay people and would -- would require $50,000 a day in fines. We -- we are looking at a statute and trying to figure out what Congress intended to write to give people that kind of predictability. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-587, the Department of Homeland Security versus Regents of the University of California, and the related cases. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2017, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA and the expansion of DACA were likely unlawful, a judgment this Court affirmed by an equally divided Court.
In the face of those decisions, the Department of Homeland Security reasonably determined that it no longer wished to retain the DACA policy based on its belief that the policy was illegal, its serious doubts about its illegality, and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies. That decision did not violate the APA for two reasons.
First, it's not subject to judicial review.
The rescission simply ended a previous non-enforcement policy whereby the Department agreed to not enforce the INA against hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens. But the decision whether or not to enforce the law is committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion, unless a statute restricts it.
And nothing in the INA requires the Department, a law enforcement agency, to not enforce the law. Second, the decision to end this non-enforcement policy was eminently reasonable. DACA was a temporary stopgap measure that, on its face, could be rescinded at any time.
And the Department's reasonable concerns about its legality and its general opposition to broad non-enforcement policies provided more than a reasonable basis for ending it. After all, an agency isn't required to push its legally dubious power to not enforce the law to its logical extreme since it undermines confidence in the rule of law itself and it conflicts with the agency's law enforcement mission. I'd like to begin with the reviewability question.
If the Attorney General were to say that he wasn't going to seek death penalty prosecutions because he thought the death penalty was unconstitutional, that would be immune from judicial review.
And if a new attorney general came in and reversed that policy because he believed that the death penalty was constitutional, that would likewise be immune from judicial review because -- General Francisco, there's a strange element to your argument because you're arguing this is a discretionary matter; it's not reviewable because it's committed to agency discretion. But, on the other hand, you say the agency had no discretion because this program was illegal.
In other words, the law requires you to drop DACA.
So how can it be committed to your discretion when you're saying we have no discretion; this is an illegal program? For two reasons, Your Honor.
First, we've put forward both legal and policy reasons for the rescission, so this case is on all fours with Chaney, where the FDA likewise put forth legal and policy reasons. Its principal argument was that it lacked jurisdiction to reg -- to regulate state use of drugs in carrying out the death penalty.
Its alternative argument was that even if it had the legal authority to do so, it wouldn't have exercised it. And this Court found that that decision was committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion.
Here, we are likewise making alternative legal and policy arguments. What's your -- But, secondly -- Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Secondly, even if we were making purely a legal argument, and we're not, but even if we were, review would be foreclosed by this Court's decision in BLE. What the BLE case held was that if an action is committed to an agency's unreviewable discretion, then it doesn't matter what reason it gives for taking that action; it's still unreviewable.
And the specific example this Court provided in BLE was a prosecutor who decided not to indict for a purely legal reason. And the Court indicated that that was still unreviewable because the underlying action, the enforcement discretion, was committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion. So, here, we think we win under Chaney, and we also think we win under BLE. What if the Attorney General said he, in his exercise of prosecutorial discretion, was not going to enforce any of the immigration laws? Uh -- Would that still be non-reviewable? Your Honor, then I think that you might run into Chaney's exception for a complete abdication of authority, but there's a critical difference between that and this.
Here, we are enforcing the law.
You can understand why Congress or the courts might say that you can review a -- a decision not to enforce the law.
Congress, in fact, passes laws so they'll be enforced, and you can understand why it might restrict the government's ability to not enforce the law. Here, we are enforcing the law.
And it's very difficult to see why the Congress would ever pass a law, say that something is illegal, and then try to hamstring the government's ability to enforce it.
That's why we think we clearly fall within the Chaney presumption, that it's an exercise of enforcement discretion, and we don't fall within the Chaney exception, which would apply where Congress itself restricts the discretion or where there's a potential complete abdication of enforcement authority, as Chaney made clear might also be an exception. Was DACA -- Just to -- just to understand what you're saying, General, you -- that would suggest that the original DACA is reviewable, but the rescission of DACA is not. In other words, are you suggesting that there's an asymmetry in what's reviewable? There -- That they don't stand and fall together? Yeah, there is, because there's a difference in the two policies.
Both of them -- to be clear, both of them fall within Chaney's presumption.
Both of them reflect an exercise of enforcement discretion that are presumptively unreviewable. The question then is whether Congress has done anything to restrict that discretion. With respect to DAPA, the case that this Court had before it a couple of years ago, Texas argued that the INA actually restricted the agency's ability not to enforce the law. And you can certainly understand why Congress might try to hamstring the government's ability not to enforce the laws that it passes.
And the Fifth Circuit agreed.
So that fell within the Chaney exception to the presumption. Here, though, nobody is arguing, nobody on either side, is arguing that the INA somehow restricts our ability to enforce the law.
And it would be quite surprising if Congress were to pass a law that says something is illegal and then tries to somehow restrict the government's ability from enforcing the laws that it passes. So, again, I think we fall four square within the Chaney presumption, and the Chaney exception doesn't apply.
And that exception applies -- that exception covers both where the statute itself restricts the discretion, and, Chief Justice, to your question, it could also apply where there was a complete abdication of law enforcement responsibilities.
That was one of the areas that Chaney reserved in that critical Footnote 4. But, here, we're not not enforcing the law.
We're enforcing the law.
And there is simply nothing in the INA that somehow says to the Department of Homeland Security you are restricted in any way or shape or form -- Can I go back -- -- from enforcing the laws we pass. The response that you -- that you gave to me, I didn't see -- I thought that what you call it, the Duke Memorandum, Duke Memorandum said DACA is illegal.
I didn't see where it said, whether it's illegal or not, as a matter of administration policy, we are withdrawing it. Uh-huh.
So -- I didn't see that. Yeah. You said there were alternate arguments.
I saw only the first, we can't enforce DACA; we can't adhere to DACA because it's illegal. So two responses, Your Honor.
First of all, Secretary Nielsen's memoranda clearly encompasses all of the different arguments.
It sets them forth in great detail.
And we think that the Nielsen memorandum is clearly properly before the Court. The district court in Washington, D.C., specifically asked for it.
We specifically provided it.
The district court reviewed it. So the only question really is, what does it mean? And Secretary Nielsen in her memorandum effectively ratified Secretary Duke's decision for the reasons given, using precisely the same mechanism that Secretary Duke used herself to issue the memo in the first place, the same mechanism that was issued -- used to issue the DACA memo, and the same mechanism used to issue the DAPA memo. So this isn't a post hoc rationalization of agency action.
It is agency action.
The whole point of the post hoc rationalization rule is to prevent courts from invading into executive branch decision-making. I thought the point -- I mean, this is an old argument. Yeah. And there have been two bases.
The first base is a big argument between Ken Davis and Burger, you know, and is -- is it that you can't review an agency, does that little thing about you cannot -- commit it to agency discretion by law, does it mean that there's certain -- just mean that there are certain things an agency might do.
Don't review them even if they're totally wrong, like Panama Canal tolls. Right. Okay? That isn't here, I don't think. The Chaney argument, I thought was the reason this is unreviewable, is because there's a long history and tradition of a prosecutor saying, I know that guy over there, or that woman here, and they may be guilty, but, in my discretion, no, I don't want to prosecute them. There's a long history of that. Uh-huh. And if that history, an understandable power to give to a prosecutor, is to be valid, courts, stay out of it.
Now that does not apply where what's at issue is not a prosecutor making an individualized decision but, rather, an agency's policies -- Right. -- generalized, written down, and I can't think of a reason why in such a case you wouldn't review it in a court. So, respectfully, Your Honor, I strongly disagree because Chaney itself involved not a prosecutor but an agency and not a single shot enforcement action but a general policy. Here's what the FDA said in the letter denying the petition brought by the inmates to have it regulate the state exercise of the death penalty.
This is their principal conclusion. Yeah. ""For the reasons given below, we conclude that the use of lethal injection by state penal systems is a practice over which FDA has no jurisdiction and, therefore, that FDA has no authority to take the actions your petition requests.
Accordingly, your petition is denied."" It later provided as the alternative rationale a policy rationale, and it says later: ""Thus, as a secondary and separate basis of denial, we decline as a matter of enforcement discretion to pursue supplies of drugs under state control that will be used for execution by lethal injection."" So, in Chaney, the FDA clearly was announcing a categorical policy that it wasn't going to regulate the state use of drugs in carrying out the death penalty.
And it wasn't a criminal prosecution.
So I think it's on all fours in favor of us. Here, we have an exercise of enforcement discretion that is committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion under Chaney. It doesn't fall with any -- within any of the exceptions to Chaney, where Congress either restricts the exercise of that discretion, because, here, we're talking about enforcement, not non-enforcement, and it doesn't fall under the complete abdication exception to Chaney because, again, we're talking about enforcement and not non-enforcement.
And Judge -- Wouldn't what -- wouldn't what you just read also have made DACA itself unreviewable, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question from earlier? No, Your Honor, and, again, because, critically, it falls within -- What -- what's the distinction between DACA and the FDA policy? Oh, the DACA and the FDA policy? Yeah. Well, because, in the FDA policy, nobody was claiming that somehow a statute restricted the FDA's ability to not enforce the law.
Nobody made that argument. In the DAPA litigation, I think is maybe what you're referencing, Texas specifically argued that the INA did, in fact, restrict the agency's authority to exercise its enforcement discretion to not enforce the law. Well, one of the -- And, again -- -- things that -- one of the things that Texas argued in the DAPA case was that the agency action in question there conferred certain benefits on the individuals who were affected. And if that was sufficient to make that reviewable, does the wind-down of DACA remove certain benefits that individuals would have? Right. And, if it does, would that make this reviewable? I -- I -- I think the answer is no and no.
And the reason why is, first of all, the rescission of DACA doesn't rescind any benefits.
Those benefits are allowed to expire on their own terms. But, even putting that to the side, the work authorization and the other benefits are simply a collateral consequence of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion itself. So they don't recognize -- they don't make the prosecutorial discretion itself reviewable; otherwise, every grant or denial of deferred action would be subject to APA review because every grant and denial of deferred action has collateral consequences that impact work authorization. If I could give you a hypothetical that I think makes it more concrete: Suppose a prosecutor has a drug diversion program, and he says that I'm not going to prosecute this particular category of drug offenses if the individuals agree to enter into drug treatment. The drug treatment is a collateral consequence of and a benefit that flows from the prosecutorial decision, but it doesn't render the prosecutorial decision itself subject to review.
And, likewise, if a new prosecutor comes in and says, I don't like drug diversion programs, I want to have a zero tolerance policy for drug offenses, that isn't reviewable either. But I do think that the challenge to DAPA in the prior litigation was reviewable -- to be clear, it was reviewable because it fell within the Chaney exception.
Texas argued, the Fifth Circuit agreed, that the INA, in fact, restricted the Department of Homeland Security's ability to not enforce the law.
And, frankly, we -- we -- we agree with that. But the problem here is that there's no argument by anybody or any possible argument that could be made that somehow the INA restricts the Department of Homeland Security's authority to enforce the law.
After all, Congress typically wants the executive branch to enforce the laws -- General -- -- that it passes. -- are you -- is this an appropriate moment to move to, assuming reviewability, the merits? Any time you want to move there, Your Honor -- All right. -- I'll move there. One -- one -- one argument that the other side makes along those lines is similar to this one we've just been considering, the reliance interests that have grown up around DACA. And what do -- what do you say to that and whether they've been adequately considered in this case? Sure.
Two things, Your Honor.
First, I would say that to the extent there are any reliance interests, they're extremely limited.
DACA was always meant to be a temporary stopgap measure that could be rescinded at any time, which is why it was only granted in two-year increments.
So I don't think anybody could have reasonably assumed that DACA was going to remain in effect in perpetuity. Even putting that to the side here, the agency considered the reliance interests. Secretary Nielsen did so quite clearly and explicitly. The agency mitigated the reliance interests through the orderly wind-down, and it simply concluded that beyond that it didn't justify maintaining in perpetuity a program that actively facilitated violations of the law by hundreds of thousands of individuals. May I ask -- If I -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, no, continue. Thank you.
If I understand, though, your colleague's argument on the other side, it's not that Secretary Nielsen failed to consider reliance interests.
There's that paragraph, I believe, in the petition appendix around 125, somewhere in there. There's a -- there's a paragraph. But that -- but that given the extent of the reliance interests and the size of the class, more needed to be said, more could be said, and it wouldn't be a huge burden to require the government on remand to -- to say more. What -- what -- what -- what do you say to that? So -- As I understand that, that's the nature of the argument. Right.
And I guess I'd have a couple of responses to that. The first is that I -- I don't think it reflects an accurate understanding of APA review.
As this Court has repeatedly made clear, really, the only thing that matters is whether the agency -- and I think I'm quoting from the case law -- completely failed to consider an important aspect of the question. And I don't think that you can even remotely argue here, under State Farm, that we completely failed to consider an important aspect of the question. Secondly, I think that Secretary Duke's memorandum under the proper standard clearly satisfies the APA standard for -- for considering reliance interests.
She does so explicitly in -- in the portion of the memorandum that you referenced. And, in addition, what I'd point out is that at the very beginning of her memorandum, page 2, she specifically says that one of the things that she considered were the judicial opinions reviewing the Duke Memorandum, all of the district court decisions. And so then, when she gets to the specific discussion of reliance interests, she says that she is keenly aware that people have ordered their lives in light of the DACA decision.
So I think it's quite clear that she is fully taking into account the whole panoply of reliance interests that were discussed ad nauseam in the district court decisions and simply concluding that they didn't just -- justify maintaining the policy. If I could continue the same question because, look, the best statement of the law in my mind -- this is a very old principle -- again, was Justice Scalia's writing for the Court in Fox. He says, when an agency's ""prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests, it must be taken into account."" All right.
That's this case, I think. Uh-huh. All right.
So I counted -- I had my law clerks count, actually, not just the people who came in, you know, the 700,000 -- Right. -- they've never been anywhere else.
They -- they never have to.
But there are all kinds of reliance interests. I counted briefs in this Court, as I'm sure you have, which state different kinds of reliance interests.
There are 66 healthcare organizations.
There are three labor unions. There are 210 educational associations.
There are six military organizations.
There are three home builders, five states plus those involved, 108, I think, municipalities and cities, 129 religious organizations, and 145 businesses. Uh-huh. And they all list reliance interests, or most of them list interest reliance -- Right. -- interests applicable to them, which are not quite the same, they are not quite the same as those of the 700,000 who have never seen any other country.
And so then I did read what you just read to me. Uh-huh. Now you want to say anything about the statement you just read to me being adequate to take into account that broad range of interests? Yes, Your Honor, I do, because the first thing I want to say is that State Farm itself says, and, here, I've got the quote, you violate the APA only where you ""entirely fail to consider an important aspect of the problem."" Here, Secretary Nielsen explicitly considered the reliance interests, including all of the things that you just listed that were set forth in -- in excruciating detail in the numerous district court decisions that have ruled -- had ruled against us -- But -- but not -- -- which she says -- -- but not in her -- -- she specifically considered. -- but not in her memo. Well, Your Honor, I, frankly, think that she does.
But the other thing that I would say is that under this conception of APA review, DACA and DAPA likewise would have failed arbitrary and capricious review because there is not a single word in the DACA memo itself or the DAPA memo itself explaining any of the potential costs or benefits or impacts on other people that the implementation of the -- Just -- just back -- If -- -- DACA program would have had. Go ahead. Go ahead. (Laughter.) I'll take either one, Your Honor. (Laughter.) If -- if I understand Secretary Nielsen's memo correctly, Secretary Nielsen said that she -- she did have a -- a conclusory statement about weighing the reliance interests, but she weighs them against what she calls -- I think it's the questionable legality of the program. Now that assumes one of the things that we're all here to discuss, which is that the program was of questionable legality.
If the program turns out not to be of questionable legality, in other words, if some or many of us think that the original program was legal, how does her memo suffice to do that balancing? Sure.
For a couple of reasons, Your Honor.
First, because she sets forth separate and independent bases justifying the rescission: first, her belief that it's illegal; second, her belief that there are serious doubts about its illegality; and, third, her conclusion that, as a matter of enforcement policy, the Department of Homeland Security is against these kinds of broad-based non-enforcement decisions. Any one of those, as her memo explicitly says -- But in her -- -- is a separate and independent basis. -- in her statement about reliance, she particularly says it outweighs this questionably legal program. I think what she is saying here is that it outweighs -- is that, given that there are extremely limited reliance interests in the first place, any limited reliance interests that exist are outweighed -- are -- are outweighed by all of the different reasons that she has articulated as separate and independent grounds for rescinding DACA. I think that's the only fair way -- General -- -- that you can read that memorandum. -- I'm -- I have always had some difficulty in understanding the illegality of DACA.
DAPA I put aside because, in DAPA -- Right. -- there was actually a process for attaining a pathway to residency.
And I saw the argument that what DAPA did was contrary, directly contrary, to that path. Uh-huh. But there -- I don't see anything in the INA that takes away the discretion of the agency in ordering its enforcement policies. Right. We all know it has limited resources.
It can't, even when it wants to -- Uh-huh. -- remove the vast majority of aliens we have here.
And so I've always had some difficulty in understanding what's wrong with an agency saying, we're going to prioritize our removals, and for those people, like the DACA people -- Right. -- who haven't committed crimes, who are lawfully employed, who are paying taxes, who pose no threat to our security, and there's a whole list of prerequisites, we're not going to exercise our limited resources -- Yeah. -- to try to get rid of those people.
I -- I still have an impossible time.
I know you're going to argue contrary to what I just said. Sure.
So I guess I have three responses, Your Honor. All right.
But let me just finish my question. Oh, sure. Okay? Yeah. So putting aside that, the Secretary, in giving these extra reasons, because none of this was in the Duke memo, and I thought basic administrative law is you look at what's first given to you, not what this -- you add later, but assuming you ignore that and even look at the Nielsen memo, I think my colleagues have rightly pointed there's a whole lot of reliance interests that weren't looked at, including the very President of -- current President telling DACA-eligible people that they were safe under him and that he would find a way to keep them here. And so he hasn't and, instead, he's done this.
And that, I think, has something to be considered before you rescind the policy. Right. Not just say I'll give you six months to do it -- Right.
So -- so -- -- to destroy your lives. So -- Putting all of that aside -- and I'm going to get to my question. (Laughter.) And maybe we'd have an opportunity to hear the three answers. Well, don't forget the three.
I know you won't. But, really, where is all of this in the memo? Sure, Your Honor. Where -- where is all of this really considered and weighed? So -- And where is the political decision made clearly? So -- so I -- That this is not about the law; this is about our choice to destroy lives? Yeah.
So, Your Honor, four responses now.
I think I've added one. (Laughter.) The first one is that I -- I think that the prior President didn't, couldn't, and hasn't made any kind of promise that DACA would remain in effect in perpetuity because it would have been impossible to make that promise.
In fact, every one of my friends on the other side, I think, has agreed that we could rescind DACA at any time if, at least in their view, we did provide a little bit more detailed of an explanation. So I think that is four square against the notion that there are some significant reliance interests because all that they seem to be saying is we have to write a few more words. Putting that entirely to the side and turning to the legality question, ultimately, I don't think you -- my first point is I don't think you have to decide ultimately whether DACA is legal or illegal because I think the other reasons we've given are more than sufficient to justify the rescission, both our serious doubts about its legality, as well as our general opposition to broad-based non-enforcement policies. After all, the Department of Homeland Security is a law enforcement agency, and a law enforcement agency doesn't have to push its dubious power to not enforce the law to its logical extreme.
So -- But don't you have to -- don't you have to set up some kind of categories? I mean, everybody agrees, what is that, how many, 11 million people? Right. They don't have the resources, so you have to prioritize.
Everybody agrees you have to prioritize. Absolutely, Your Honor. How do you -- how do you do it other than categorically? Well, and that's my second point, Your Honor.
My second point is that DACA goes far beyond simply diverting resources to higher priority targets, which you are absolutely right, every law enforcement agency has to divert resources to higher priority targets.
DACA goes materially further than that because it actively facilitates violations of the law by providing advance forbearance, coupling it with affirmative benefits like work authorization and Social Security benefits, doing it on a categorical basis. And, significantly -- and this was my third point -- it has no limiting principle.
On the -- So the -- the forbearance would be okay if it -- there weren't attendant benefits? This -- we're not going to -- we're not going to immediately deport the Dreamers, period? I think that would be -- if -- if you provided just the advanced forbearance, I think that would be a lot closer of a question, but, here, it's a lot easier because you're coupling that with work authorization. And my final and critical point is that there's no limiting principle.
The theory on which DACA rests effectively allows the government to create a shadow INA for any category of aliens that it chooses to make low-priority targets, a shadow second-tier INA. And you, at the very least, need to locate something in the INA that confers that kind of broad and unfettered discretion.
And there is simply nothing there.
But, again -- Well -- well, if -- -- I don't think you -- You know, the INA does give quite a lot of discretion to administrative officers, as you yourself admit and have argued on previous occasions and, indeed, in part here. Right. So are you saying that -- are you saying that DACA was -- violated any particular provision of the INA? What are you saying it violated? Sure. Because -- So I'm saying -- -- because there's a big delegation, right, that says you get to make national policy.
So what did DACA violate? I'm saying two things, Your Honor.
First, I'm saying you don't really have to address this issue because we think all of the other -- I got that. -- reasons are more than sufficient. But, secondly, we're not saying that there's a specific provision that it conflicts with.
But what we are saying is that when you adopt this kind of broad and historically unprecedented program, you need to at least locate the authority to do so somewhere in the INA. Well, they did -- And this goes -- -- you know, they located the authority in the INA's grant of broad discretion over national immigration enforcement policy. Your Honor, I think that the most that does is it gives you the authority to set policies and priorities, but there's a big leap between that and saying that you can affirmatively facilitate violations of the INA by hundreds of thousands of individuals to whom Congress has repeatedly declined a pathway to lawful status. What about -- I guess -- Again, though, I -- I don't think this is an issue you need to ultimately resolve because I think the other reasons we've given for rescinding DACA are more than sufficient to justify it, including our serious doubts about its legality alone. Simply as a matter of law enforcement policy, it is eminently reasonable for a law enforcement agency to say, I'm not going to push this doubtful authority to its logical extreme when it does three things: It undermines confidence in the rule of law itself.
It conflicts with the agency's law enforcement mission.
And, in a case like this, it creates the serious possibility of a court-ordered shutdown of the program, rather than an orderly wind-down within -- Counsel, you -- -- the agency's control. -- if -- if DACA was illegal, that means that when the government was giving out these benefits it was acting illegally, right? Yes. Now it's not always the case when the government acts illegally in a way that affects other people that we go back and untangle all of the consequences of that. Did Secretary Nielsen, when she was considering the reliance interests, was she looking simply to the question of a wind-down, or was she looking more generally, for example, to the application of something like the de facto officer doctrine -- Right.
I think -- -- when officers acted illegally, but we don't go back and invalidate their prior actions? I think both, Your Honor, both.
The orderly wind-down to a certain extent takes into account reliance interests. It doesn't fully account for everything.
But the whole idea was that you're giving people an opportunity to -- to -- to order their lives in -- in -- in a time period to allow them to do that. But she also specifically states in the memorandum that, in addition, the notion of ad hoc deferred action will be able to take care of reliance interests in truly extraordinary circumstances, the way that it has been used sporadically in the past to address those types of scenarios. So now the basic -- the basic hornbook rule -- we have three hornbook rules in this case, is -- is -- was mentioned, Chenery: ""It is a foundational principle of administrative law that a court may uphold agency action only on the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action."" Right. In which case we look to Ms. Duke's memo, not to Ms. Nielsen's.
Isn't that when it took the action? And, if so -- I want to hear you say no, it isn't so -- but -- but, if so, why don't we just affirm the district court, which sends it back? And if you have all these reasons and you really want to consider the reliance and all those things should be considered carefully, you can do it. So -- so what's wrong? For two related -- With very -- yeah, go ahead. For two related reasons, Your Honor. Yeah. First, sending it back would make no sense because the agency has already acted.
Secretary Nielsen has already ratified Secretary Duke's decision for the reasons set forth in her memorandum.
It's not a post hoc rationalization.
It's the official position of the agency set forth by the agency itself. And, secondly, there is no reason why Secretary Nielsen should have had to reinstate DACA and then rescind it again. Not reinstate it. Well, but -- but -- What you do is, there are 50 cases on this, if it's important, what you do is you say it is good reason for holding the status quo until we can go back, and courts have affirmed that, we hold the status quo, and we go back now and we look if there are reasons beyond the contemporaneous reason, which is the Duke memo. Well, that's -- And we see if there will -- -- that's precisely what Secretary Nielsen's memo did.
It did two things. First, it explained the basis for Secretary Nielsen -- Secretary Duke's decision, but, secondly, it set forth her own independent judgment.
And if I could point you to -- You mean we have all these 100 and 350 briefs with all these different reasons and she had that in front of her? Your Honor, that may go to whether you think her memo is sufficient, but it doesn't go to whether you think her memo is an operative document with this -- in this litigation.
I'd like to point you to two places in her memorandum. First, page 121A of the Regents Petitioners' appendix.
This is the second page of her memorandum: The explanation reflects, the first thing, my understanding of the Duke Memorandum, and, second thing, why the decision to rescind the DACA policy was and remains sound. If you look at the end of her memorandum, she states in the very last sentence: For the reasons in -- for these reasons in setting -- in setting DHS enforcement policies and priorities, I concur with and decline to disturb Acting Secretary Duke's decisions to rescind the DACA policy. Can I pick up on Justice Kagan's question earlier? Does the Nielsen memo ever say, even if DACA was lawful, I would still exercise my policy discretion to discontinue? Yes, Your Honor. So, if you look at the memo -- What -- what -- what sentence are you looking at? Okay.
I'm looking at two sentences.
Page 123A -- this is after she says it's illegal -- page 123A. Second, regardless of whether the DACA policy is ultimately illegal, it was appropriately rescinded by the DHS because there are at a minimum serious doubts about its legality.
May I make one more sentence? And then, third, if you look further down the page, it says: Regardless of whether these concerns about the DACA policy render it illegal or legally questionable, there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government's termination of DACA triggered abrupt, tangible, adverse consequences and substantial disruptions in the lives of 700,000 individuals, their families, employers, communities, and Armed Forces. That decision required the government to provide an accurate, reasoned, rational, and legally sound explanation. It utterly failed to do so, asserting only the Attorney General's unexplained assertion that he had no discretion because DACA was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch. The decision overturned a five-year enforcement policy of deferred action that had enabled DACA recipients under other unchallenged laws and regulations to apply for employment authorization, seek driver's licenses, and other benefits. Its abrupt reversal removed a condition precedent to these rights and exposed DACA recipients and their employers to immediate, potential, coercive government measures. It was impermissible to do so based on an unexplained, unsupported, and erroneous legal conclusion that the policy that two administrations had enforced and implemented, had supported and implemented for five years, was unlawful and unconstitutional. The decision to rescind DACA was reviewable.
This Court has said several times in the -- just in the past few years that there's -- we start with a strong presumption of reviewability of agency decisions.
This is the strong presumption that the Court described in the Weyerhaeuser case just one year ago. Unless agency discretion is limited by law, and there's no citation to any limitation in the law, limitations on administration -- reviewability by the courts are quite narrowly construed, and there are rare circumstances. These are the Mach Mining case and the Judulang case. These Weyerhaeuser, Mach Mining and Judulang case are three cases within the past eight years where this Court has talked about the presumption of reviewability as a strong presumption, narrowly -- exceptions narrowly construed, and all three of those decisions were unanimous decisions by this Court. Would you say that whenever a law enforcement agency has guidelines for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and it then tightens those guidelines so that cases that previously would not have been prosecuted may now be prosecuted, that is agency action that is subject to review under the APA? I would not say that, Justice Alito.
But this is a very, very different circumstance.
This is an agency decision initially, and -- and the Attorney General refers to it as an illegal decision, but it's an initial decision that is responsive to explicit congressional direction to DHS to establish enforcement priorities. That's what DACA was all about.
It said it did not establish any status, it did not provide any benefits, it articulated an enforcement priority which Congress not only directed DHS to make but, in fact, required it to make because only 400,000 people -- Well, I'm not sure -- -- out of 11 -- -- I'm not sure that really responds to my question, so I'll give you an example.
Let's say that a -- that there is a policy that certain -- a certain category of drug cases will not be prosecuted in federal court.
Let's say they are cases involving less than five kilos of cocaine.
So case -- cocaine cases with lesser amounts of drugs will not be prosecuted in federal court as a matter of enforcement priority.
And then that is changed. So the five kilos is reduced to three. Would that be reviewable? No, I don't think it would be. What is -- well, what's the difference? Well, I think that the Justice Department, through the attorney general, every new attorney general establishes new enforcement priorities with respect to pornography or drug cases or things like that. Those -- that's completely different than this, which singled out a category of persons and, pursuant to congressional authorization, invited them into the program, provided other statutes which have not been challenged by the government, provided benefits that were associated with that decision, and other people -- and individuals relied upon that for five years.
The administration, when it does that kind of a decision with respect to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, which has engendered reliance, which reverses not only a position of the -- of two administrations, but the Office of Legal Counsel, changes policy, then all we're saying is that there's a presumption of reviewability of that decision. But you're -- you're saying it's reviewable because DACA conferred certain benefits. DACA did not confer -- Beyond deferred prosecution. DACA -- Is that -- is that what you just said? DACA -- no, I said the benefits were conferred -- were triggered by the decision of enforcement policy in DACA, but those benefits are triggered by other statutes enacted by Congress, funded by Congress throughout all this entire period of time, and the government hasn't challenged those. So those benefits, the driver's license business and the -- and the work authorization, if you apply for it, if you come forward, identify yourself, put yourself into the program, take risks -- But, Mr. Olson, the whole thing was about work authorization and these other benefits.
Both administrations have said they're not going to deport people.
So the deferred prosecution or deferred deportation, that's not what the focus of the policy was.
Yes, the other statutes provided that, but it was triggered by -- by the memo. Yeah. So I don't understand sort of putting what the policy really was about, which is the work authorization and the other things, off to one side is very helpful. Well, I think that it -- you -- one has to focus on the fact that this was -- Congress authorized the IN -- the Department of Homeland Security to identify enforcement priorities.
Once it did -- because it -- it was required to do so and it had no choice because of the funding.
Once it did so, and it identified the persons -- and this is helpful to the agents in the field to identify which individuals are going to be subject to enforcement and which individuals are not. Other statutes provided that benefit. You're correct that it triggers that, but it's triggered by other benefits and so forth.
If the government is opposed to those benefits given to individuals who are not in an enforcement priority category to support themselves, to go to work, rather than put themselves in the hands of the government to support them, and to become a part -- since they're not going to be deported, at least for the short period of time, those are the things that if the government wanted to get rid of, the government should be challenging those. It should not be challenging a decision that's essentially required by Congress.
And let there be no mistake about why this decision was made. The Attorney General specifically said that DACA was illegal and unconstitutional.
I don't know where the unconstitutional came from because it didn't come from the Fifth Circuit. But let's say it was an un- -- an illegal enforcement priority. And there's no doubt about why this happened.
In the cert petition or in the government's brief that refers to the questions presented, it specifically says the original DACA policy was unlawful and then goes on to say, thus, it had to be terminated. There's no question about that.
So the Duke Memorandum, which was -- the Attorney General's decision and opinion under statute is enforceable and binding on the government agencies.
There's a statute that specifically says that.
So the Duke Memorandum had no discretion, no choice.
The Attorney General of the United States -- Mr. Olson, I -- I think you've moved on to the merits, and I -- I guess I'm still struggling with Justice Alito's question on -- on reviewability.
Can you help me understand what is the limiting principle? I -- I -- I hear a lot of facts, sympathetic facts, you put out there, and -- and they speak to all of us.
But what's the limiting principle between, you say, reviewability here for an enforcement, a classic kind of prosecutorial discretion that one might have thought would have fallen under Heckler versus Chaney, and the example Justice Alito gave or Heckler versus Chaney itself? What's -- Heckler -- -- what's the -- what's the limiting legal principle -- Well, there's a -- -- you'd have this Court adopt? -- it's a composite -- in this case, it's a composite of principles, a determination that -- a categorical determination involving a substantial number of people -- Okay.
But I -- I -- -- to make decisions -- -- I think -- -- based upon that. All right.
Let -- let -- let me just stop you there, though, because, if it's categorical and a large number of people, I can think of a lot of prosecutorial decisions involving drug cases, the treatment of marijuana in -- in -- in our society today under federal law, perhaps it would be cocaine, five kilograms.
Whatever is in the attorney general memo affects lots of people on a categorical basis every day. And -- Yes. -- and you're not -- you -- you, I think, would not have us review those decisions. That's -- no, but may I refer to -- So, if it's not categorical and it's not a large number of people -- Well -- -- what's the limiting principle? -- there -- as I said, it's a combination of factors which include the government inviting people to rely upon and make decisions based upon that policy, the provision of benefits connected with it, individuals making choices, and -- and then -- and the Heckler case -- Don't -- don't other -- MR. OlSON: -- specifically -- -- people rely on the attorney general guidance memos and documents? There's an entire industry in a lot of states involving marijuana that would argue they're relying on memos issued by the attorney general that we will not enforce marijuana laws, for example.
Do they now have a right to -- No, I think that is completely different.
They are not invited to participate into a program, to reveal the business that they're in, to come forward, to take advantage -- Well, they -- -- of benefits -- -- have a lot of economic interests at stake that, I think, under Fox and -- what we heard about earlier from Justice Breyer, they would say our economic interests are very real, billions of dollars are at stake, we've relied on the attorney general's guidance memos. But there's -- but there -- but -- and I just would like to quote this one paragraph -- or one sentence from the Heckler versus Chaney decision itself.
""When an agency does act to enforce, the action itself provides a focus for judicial review because it imposes the coercive power of the government with respect to individual liberty and property,"" and that is the kind of decision that judicial review is intended to give. Doesn't every prosecutorial decision affect individual liberty or property? Prosecution -- prosecutorial -- I think the answer is yes, isn't it? Prosecutorial decisions, yes, of course. Okay. This is a -- an announcement of a policy -- this is a reversal of a policy that the government created that triggered -- to use the words of this Court, engendered reliance interests.
And all we're saying is that it should be subject to review in the context of this big picture. It isn't to say that every decision by a prosecutor that I'm going to now enforce murder cases or kidnapping cases or child porn cases or serious drug cases.
It doesn't cause individuals to come forward to participate in a program, to make decisions.
Businesses, health, educational institutions, the Armed Forces, all are making decisions based upon this. No one was saying that the policy can't be changed.
But when the policy does -- if the government wishes to change a broad policy like this which affects so many people in so many serious ways -- Well, if I might ask a question about that if we're talking about the merits then, and then I -- I'll pass off the baton.
The reliance interests that we've -- we've talked about earlier, I -- I think your -- your friend on the other side would say we did address reliance interests in a paragraph and we could do it in 15 pages, but we'd say pretty much the same thing at the end of the day, and it would take another six years, and it would leave this class of persons under a continuing cloud of uncertainty and continue stasis in the political branches because they would not have a baseline rule of decision from this Court still on this issue. It's -- it's what this Court has said -- What do you say to -- what do you say to that? And that's the line of argument, as I understand it, from the government. Yes, I know it is.
And the government is saying all we needed was a few more words.
That is not what this Court has said with respect to administrative review of -- of -- judicial review of administrative decisions. You must have a rational explanation. It must make sense.
It must be contemporaneous. The -- I will get to the Nielsen memorandum which was not contemporaneous.
It was not a new decision. I -- I understand that.
If you could just address it, though, on the merits.
Why was that insufficient, I think is one of the questions, and the other is what would -- what good would another five years of litigation over the adequacy of that -- We don't -- -- explanation serve? -- we don't know what the administration would do.
The administration did not want to own this decision. When the Attorney General decided that this -- I'm making this decision because the I guess I'm asking about the reliance interests question. I -- I'm trying to get to that. I -- I wish -- I wish you would. The reliance interests were triggered, to use the words of this Court in the Fox case, the LTV case, and various other cases, those reliance interests were engendered by the decision by the government that caused people to come forward -- I understand that. The question is: What more would you have the government say about those reliance interests? If it's a failure of adequacy of explaining, what more is left to be said? What -- what they could have said is that we understand all of these people, working for all these people, we understand what people are going through, provide a reasoned, rational explanation, to use the words of this Court just a few months ago in the Census case, to explain those things, to explain why a policy is being changed and make a contemporaneous decision. The Nielsen memorandum came along nine months later, was based upon a different individual -- by a different individual. But -- It didn't have an administrative record. Assuming -- well, go ahead and finish. Well, well, it'll take another sentence or two.
But there were a lot of things wrong. The -- the Nielsen memorandum was not an independent decision.
She was bound just as the earlier administrator, acting administrator, was because the Attorney General said this is illegal. But the Nielsen memo then goes on to say, as you heard Mr. Francisco say to my question, that regardless of whether these concerns about the DACA policy rendered it illegal or legally questionable, there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy. And it goes on to explain the policy rationales to rescind it.
So what is your -- Well -- -- response to Mr. Francisco? -- in the first place, they were not independent.
They were not contemporaneous.
They were not accompanied by an administrative record. She -- They were not -- -- she says -- she says they're independent in that sentence. She says they're independent. At least that's what Mr. Francisco says to you. Well, Mr. Francisco said that and she said that, but they weren't independent because she was bound by the Attorney General's decision.
And the government itself in its brief, and I quoted a moment ago, said DACA was unlawful; thus, we had to terminate it. Now -- and it does -- and it's not contemporaneous.
And then, basically, the policy decisions are saying we understand people may have relied on this, but that's just too bad. Mr. Olson -- That's basically all it was.
There were not -- and then the litigation risk issue -- Right.
I got that. -- is like a rubber stamp that the agencies can put on anything.
Every decision an agency makes could involve -- Do you -- do you agree that the executive has the legal authority to rescind DACA? Yes. Okay.
So the question then comes down to the explanation. And if it's the Nielsen memo paragraph on reliance that it comes down to, so which is the last -- Well, it wasn't -- it -- first of all, it was not explained -- Just -- can I just ask the question in this way, which is, assume the Nielsen memo comes in and assume it comes down to whether the Nielsen memo adequately explained the reliance interests. What was the shortfall in the Nielsen memo in addressing reliance interests? Because she does acknowledge that a lot of people have relied.
She does it -- And she -- -- briefly. Yeah, she says just too bad.
People relied, so too bad.
Too bad about that. Camp versus Pitts specifically says, when an explanation for an agency decision is given, however curt, they must stand or fall on that explanation. Do you -- do you think -- This is a new -- -- do you think you could explain the reliance or the justifications for the policy in a way that would overcome the reliance interests? They would -- yes, I -- I believe that that's possible.
They could have -- they -- the analysis of costs and benefits explaining why an OLC decision is being thrown out the window, why a policy is being changed that the administration is -- that's exactly what you have said. Mr. Olson, can I go back to something Justice Gorsuch asked, which is what's the benefit of delaying this further? It has been -- at least looking at the deferred action decisions, the dozens that have gone on through the decades, Congress has responded, sometimes changing the policy, sometimes limiting it, sometimes expanding it. It -- it has responded. But the dynamic is very different, isn't it, when an executive says, I don't have the power, and when it says, even if I had the power -- Hypothetical. -- I choose not to do this.
Aren't the dynamics of what happens between Congress and the President dramatically different in those circumstances? Exactly.
This is what is called virtual reality.
One said, I can't do -- I don't have the power to do it, but, if I did in the sky, I might have done it for this reason. The answer, the short answer to your question, Justice Sotomayor, and it's a very good one, someone say I might have done it if I'd had the power to do it, but I have no discretion, I have no power to do it, it -- we don't know what the administration would do if it had to make this decision and take ownership and accountability of this decision. That's your point about given the Attorney General decision and the law that says they have to change it. That's a very different circumstance than saying, even if I don't have to, I won't. That's exactly right.
The administration would then have to explain we want to take responsibility for throwing these people out of work, removing people that came here when they were maybe two years old, who have not committed a crime, and who have -- and volunteered for this program, have -- have -- have conducted themselves properly and so forth. Mr. Olson, I -- I understand that litany.
But do you seriously want to argue that if this case were to go back and the agency were to say, again, exactly what General Francisco interprets the Nielsen memo as saying, giving all of these reasons and saying that each one is an alternatively -- is an independently sufficient basis for the -- the action, would -- would that be unlawful? Let's say they -- they go into great length in explaining every -- Well -- -- every -- every factor, every basis. Certainly. If they explained and provided a rational explanation instead of just pushing a button or putting a rubber stamp on it, that's what judicial review is all about. That means the agency would have taken responsibility for making the consequences of those decisions, explaining why it thought about it and why it decided what to do. That's what your decisions require by judicial review. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mongan. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It was up to Petitioners to decide how to frame their decision to terminate DACA.
They could have taken responsibility for a discretionary decision, rescinding a policy that affects hundreds of thousands of lives. Instead, they chose to end the policy based on the ground that DACA was unlawful.
They told the public that the law deprived them of any discretion to continue it.
And when Judge Bates invited them to make a new decision, they stood by the old one. That's their prerogative, but it has the consequence that they have to defend that decision based on the legal rationale they originally offered, and the decision is reviewable and cannot be sustained on that basis. Now the problem with the rationale is, yes, they don't take serious account of the dramatic costs to DACA recipients and the economy and their employers and families of terminating this policy, and also that it is founded on the incorrect legal premise that DACA is unlawful. This Court can review the lack of -- and affirm based on the lack of an adequate explanation for that ground or the fact that it is an incorrect conclusion and it is legal error. Now, if I can turn to the question of reviewability, the APA says that it commits agency actions that are committed to agency discretion by law are unreviewable. And the central point here is that when a agency founds a decision on a public announcement that it lacks any discretion to continue a policy, that can't fairly be described as committed to agency discretion in any meaningful sense. This is the concept that the Court reserved in Footnote 4 of Chaney, because that is not a discretionary choice that the law has committed to agency discretion. I think that it is critical for us to consider on the merits what my friend's position is with respect to DACA and deferred action.
My friend appears to agree that they can grant deferred action to compelling individuals, that they can grant work authorization to deferred action recipients, and they seem to agree that this is a very worthy class of individuals. So their position boils down to the assertion that the INA prohibits them from adopting a transparent framework that guides the exercise of individualized discretion with respect to this very compelling population of individuals. And that's not consistent with the broad authority that Congress has granted the Secretary under the INA and under 6 U.S.C. 202, and it's not consistent with historical practice, where the agency, over the decades, has frequently adopted class-based discretionary relief policies that allow it to channel the exercise of recognized forms of discretion with respect to particular individuals in a defined class. Well, that -- that history is not close to the number of people covered by DACA. Well, Your Honor, there's a history of class-based deferred action policies, and they are narrower, to be sure, but there are other class-based policies that have applied to hundreds of thousands of individuals. The family fairness policy, when announced, would have applied to up to 40 percent of -- Fifty -- 50,000 people, right? That's the number that availed themselves of that policy? That's right, because it was short-lived.
But, at the time it was announced, it was not clear that Congress was going to act, and the executive told Congress that this would apply to up to 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time. When Congress did act in that statute, they signaled their approval of the executive policy.
The statute didn't have an effective date for another year.
And Congress said that this is not intended to express disapproval of the existing executive policy. And that's one example, but there are more examples of -- That sounds -- that percentage was 1.5 million people, very comparable to this decision. Yes, and at a time when the total undocumented population was much smaller than it is today. Now it -- it is critical for the executive, in an area where it has broad discretionary authority, to be able to set policies that channel the exercise of that authority, and this is a transparent framework that has the benefit of allowing for some measure of consistency and an even-handed approach in the exercise of deferred action. General, suppose that this administration had not relied on legal grounds to rescind the policy, which is very different from what they did, but let's just suppose otherwise, that they had immediately and only relied on policy considerations. Are you saying even then it would -- the -- the rescission would be reviewable? And why would that be? So, if it were a pure policy rationale, it would fall outside of Chaney.
It would be presumptively reviewable, as most agency actions are.
I think it would be challenged, and the challengers would likely argue that there's sufficient general standards in this area to allow for a minimal level of rationality review. Why would it fall outside of Chaney, do you think? I think that Chaney was very specific about the type of agency action that it addressed.
It was a concrete decision by the agency not to enforce a statute with respect to particular actors. Now that is different from a broad policy that guides the exercise of deferred action decisions prospectively.
And Chaney was founded on a recognized tradition of non-review. It pointed to cases going back to the 19th Century. Well, when you say ""particular actors,"" did it not apply to anybody who was facing execution using -- using -- by -- by lethal injection? Well, as General Francisco has noted, there were broad policy considerations underlying the decision, but, as it was described by the Court, it was a decision not to enforce with respect to particular prison administrators and drug companies. And I think a -- a different point here is that -- Well, hasn't that been FDA policy for all of the years since Chaney? Sure, Your Honor, but that's a -- Well, that's a big class of people. But that's a flat determination not to enforce, as opposed to a policy guiding future decisions about whether to grant deferred action, which itself is not a flat or final non-enforcement decision.
They have argued that deferred action is revocable at any time and could be -- and is not a defense to removal. So we're dealing with a different type of policy here than the one that the agency dealt with in Chaney. Well, what is it exactly? I mean, look, I -- I -- I've always thought, well, it means the individualized kind of decision, but, quite rightly, the -- the solicitor general reads me the language, which is programmatic.
But agency -- the United States has hundreds, thousands of agencies which do enforce all kinds of things, which make programmatic rules all the time. And so what -- it can't mean that Heckler is interpreting this, committed to agency discretion, to make serious inroads in the principle of judicial review, but everybody's struggling, including me, what's the line? And what's the line generally? It can't be so broad of all programs. It can't be so narrow as an individualized decision.
Just what is it? Well, I think we can look to the language of the Chaney decision.
It describes a decision not to take enforcement action.
So perhaps if there is a broad policy that is a flat categorical decision that we will not take enforcement action, that would be one thing.
But the -- Imagine an SEC rule or imagine an HHS rule and what it says is we are not going to take action to give a certain category of people their benefits.
Not reviewable? I mean, nobody would think that. Well -- So -- so -- so we're struggling still. Yes. And I'm saying honestly I am struggling to get the right rule. I -- I understand and there may be ambiguities at the margins here, but I do want to focus it on this case because, here, Acting Secretary Duke identified one ground for terminating this policy.
She said that she was -- she pointed to the Attorney General's letter, which concluded that the policy was unconstitutional and beyond statutory authority. And whether or not this might conceivably fall under Chaney, if it does, it still is subject to review. So you're saying at the minimum, one, an action to enforce is different from an action not to enforce.
Here, we have one to enforce.
And you're saying as well that the ground being purely legal, it is not a discretionary ground.
He said it was illegal, and, therefore, it is not within discretion.
Okay, have I got those two right? That's right, Your Honor. Anything else? I think those are what we have focused on in this case and that -- Well, counsel, I -- I'm sorry to interrupt there, but I actually had understood your answer on the second one to be different when you were posed that question by Justice Kagan.
And I thought you had indicated that whether it was based on policy grounds or on an illegal assessment wouldn't alter the reviewability analysis in your view. So I guess I'm just curious, which is it? So, to be more precise, if we're operating in a world where we assume that Chaney applies, our point is, regardless, this is reviewable because this is within a sub-category where the agency has disclaimed any discretionary choice.
It has said we have no authority over the matter.
And that can't -- That wasn't my -- I'm sorry, that wasn't my question. So -- so if -- if -- assuming we're living in a world in which the agency had alternative grounds and one of which was policy grounds, I had thought you told Justice Kagan that this would be reviewable. And now I thought I understood you to say something slightly different to -- to -- to Justice Breyer.
Perhap -- perhaps I'm missing something. Well, let me try and -- and clarify.
We believe that a broad policy is not the type of action that's referred to by Chaney, consistent with some of the D.C. Circuit authority that's been cited in the -- in the briefs that General -- Well, I think Justice Breyer -- that just takes us back to the beginning of the discussion with Justice Breyer, which is that can't be so necessarily because every prosecutorial discretion affects a lot of people.
You had that discussion with Justice Alito as well.
So I -- I -- I guess I -- I'll let you go, but I'm still struggling with this line that you're asking us to draw. Well, it may be a difficult line to draw in the general case, but, in this case, with respect, it is an easy line to draw because we know that this decision was founded on a binding legal determination by the Attorney General that they could not continue this policy. What if it -- And that's the -- -- what if it were less, as you view, in categorical terms? What if the Attorney General said, I've looked at this, it's -- it's -- it's a close case, but, on balance, I don't think we have the authority? Or if he said, I'm pretty sure we don't have the authority, but a court might come out differently? Does your analysis change, or is it only when he says this is -- as far as I'm concerned, this is definite; it's illegal? No, Your Honor, we would argue that it's a type of action that's presumptively reviewable, and if the agency decides to base a decision on some discretionary choice but with an explanation or rationale that's founded on litigation risk or legal doubt, that that would be a rationale that courts -- Is it enough -- -- would be equipped to review. -- for him to say, look, I've got a decision from the Fifth Circuit that tells me this is illegal, it's been affirmed by the Supreme Court by an equally divided vote? That's enough for me to say we're not going to do it? It's not enough to sustain the decision, Your Honor.
I think that, under these circumstances, given the nature of this program and the interests at stake, we don't think that any genuine statement of legal doubt or litigation risk would be adequate. But that's not what we have here. Well, even if you went through a legitimate balancing exercise, in other words, you talked about the law and what you were worried about, and then you talked about the reliance interests, and -- and then you said here's is what we're weighing and here's our judgment, do you think that that would be sufficient? I think, as a general matter, an agency could base a discretionary decision on a -- a reasoned analysis like that. I suspect that if we saw that decision, we would challenge it under the particular circumstances here. But a court might agree that if there were some substantial and detailed consideration of the actual costs of this and the reasoned legal analysis, then maybe that would be, in a court's eyes, sufficient, but that's absolutely not what we have here. So -- We have a -- -- so if this -- if you prevail and the case goes back, is it enough to say, look, we've read the amicus briefs that Justice Breyer pointed out about the reliance interests; we've read, you know, the Fifth Circuit's opinion in -- in the Texas litigation, presumably, they would cite that as well, would that be enough? I think that it would have to begin with the deficiencies that Judge Bates identified, which is that the agency has not actually identified with any particularity the legal grounds that it's concerned with.
It does cite -- Well, it's not -- -- the DAPA case. Yeah, I mean, what -- do you need more than that? You've got a court of appeals decision affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court.
Can't he just say that's the basis on which I'm making this decision? Your Honor, no, and I think Judge Bates is exactly right on this.
The reasoned explanation requirement is meant to facilitate judicial review and inform the public. And, yes, they point to the DAPA case, but there's four or five theories of illegality floating around there ranging from the notice and comment to the Take Care Clause claim.
And we don't know which ground the agency based its decision on. So that is a lack of a reasoned explanation, in addition to the fact that -- Well, what would an adequate explanation look like? I mean, what do you think they would have to do to be in the clear on this? Well, I think that they would at least have to identify the particular grounds that they're relying on to facilitate further judicial review of their underlying legal conclusion and explain why they believe it applies to the DACA policy when they pointed to a case about a different policy, and then have some serious, and more serious than what we see in the Nielsen memo, accounting of the very substantial -- But suppose they say, yeah, we'll do that, we'll do that.
And now the authorities are legion on -- that -- that you -- we should decide on the basis of that Duke memo. That was the decision, rested on that.
And we've heard that, okay. There's another case where Justice Fortas wrote, you shouldn't play ping pong with the agency, okay? So they're saying that's what the -- a lot of their argument was. What's the point? What's the point? I mean, you'll send it back, and they'll say, okay, right, DAPA was different; in DAPA, the court said that, here, the DAPA program makes 4.2 million people citizens with a run-around of the normal way to become citizens when you have a child who's a citizen.
And, here, that has nothing to do with this case. They're not -- no run-around.
Okay, you point that out, they point -- okay, we're going to come out the same way.
It's close enough. So should -- what's the argument against playing -- as there is a sentence for, against you, playing ping pong with the agency? I think that there is a very substantial meaning to a remand in this case, Your Honor.
We don't truly know what the agency would do if confronted with a discretionary choice. If they knew that DACA were lawful, there's a new Secretary, and the administration has expressed broad sympathy for this population, and they very well might continue the policy or stop short of wholesale termination. And if we are remanding in light of the lack of a reasoned explanation, my friend has -- But it -- -- said -- -- it was remanded by Judge Bates or -- or given time, and Secretary Nielsen did what you just said and said, even if DACA was legal, you heard Mr. Francisco on that, I would exercise my discretion to rescind, and then explained her consideration of the reliance interests. So why is -- there's already been, in effect, a remand. There -- there is a boilerplate assertion in that memo of independence, I will grant you that.
I think if we look at the circumstances -- Well, can I just stop you on boilerplate? Yeah. I mean, this is a serious decision.
We all agree with that.
And -- and it was for the Secretary, presumably. And to say in writing, even if it's lawful, I nonetheless am going to exercise my discretion, I assume that was a very considered decision.
Now we can agree with it or disagree with the -- the merits of it, but it seems -- Yes, and I think it's important to look to the penultimate paragraph in that memorandum, where she conducts her collective weighing and she considers those policy rationales along with the legal rationales and say that, together, they outweigh the purported costs of terminating DACA. I also think it's critical to understand the context of this in that -- So your point, just so I understand, I think this is your point, is that the legal considerations, while she said that, end up being intertwined in the subsequent paragraphs with the policy considerations? That -- that's absolutely right.
And this was, after all, in a context of a memo that they submitted to the district court in ongoing litigation intended to defend and explain the prior decision. And I do want to note here that to the extent that my friend has suggested this is a new decision or a new action and has been presented as such, that's not consistent with what they told the district court. The district court said quite plainly, please notify me if there's a new decision. They submitted this memo and said, this is a motion to revise your order with respect to the original Duke decision; we want you to sustain the Duke decision.
And the district court took them at their word and treated it accordingly. So I don't think that they can come to this Court and suggest that it is a fresh decision and every rationale is before the Court.
Under Camp -- In that penultimate paragraph, what is the shortfall in the discussion of reliance interests, in your view? Well, I'm not sure that there are -- there is much of a discussion.
She expresses some sympathy and then ultimately says that it is up to Congress to consider and weigh the -- the reliance interests and the costs. It's not a detailed discussion of the dramatic harm to hundreds of thousands of young people, to their families, to their employers, to the states, to the economy that would arise from this decision. Well, she does say that in a sentence.
If we remanded and it were detailed more fully, would it still fall short? I think the great value of a remand is that -- Please. -- to date, they have not made a decision that actually takes ownership of a discretionary choice to end this policy.
And if they had a remand, if that is their intent, they could issue a new decision that actually does that so the public could hold them accountable for the choice they've made. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. -- oh, I'm sorry, General Francisco. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think I want to focus on three basic points.
First, Justice Kavanaugh, I want to make sure you have all of the relevant portions in the Nielsen Memorandum that I think make this all quite clear.
Page 122a, and I'm at the Regents Petitioners' appendix.
""In considering how DHS's discretion to establish enforcement policies and priorities should be exercised, the DACA policy properly was and should be rescinded for several separate and independently sufficient reasons."" She then gives the first reason, the legality question. Then if you go to page 123a.
Second, ""regardless of whether the DACA policy is ultimately illegal, it was appropriately rescinded by DHS because there are at a minimum serious doubts about its legality."" Further down the page, third, ""regardless of whether these concerns about the DACA policy render it illegal or legally questionable, there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy."" And then she sets out the enforcement policy. If you move to page 121 -- 125a, where she's discussing reliance, ""I do not believe that the asserted reliance interests outweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the other reasons for ending the policy discussed above."" And, finally, when you get to the conclusion on page 126a, ""for these reasons, in setting DHS enforcement policies and priorities, I concur with and decline to disturb Acting Secretary Duke's decisions to rescind the DACA policies."" So, frankly -- But we don't know from -- -- I don't understand -- -- from all of that, we don't know how she would respond if there were a clear recognition that there was nothing illegal about DACA. Her whole memo is infected by the idea that this is, one, illegal.
It leaves substantial doubt about its illegality. If we take that out, then -- the independent ground that you're asserting, then she would be saying, we stand up and say this is the policy of our administration.
We don't like DACA and we're taking responsibility for that, instead of trying to put the blame on the law. Respectfully, Your Honor, I very much disagree.
She sets forth explicitly on page 121a several separate and independently sufficient reasons. We own this.
We both own the policy rationale set forth in Secretary Nielsen's memorandum.
Also, because we think this is not subject to judicial review at all, we own the legal judgment set forth in Secretary Nielsen's memoranda. So simply stated, the fact that we've got alternative and legal policy grounds for making this decision make two things clear. First, it is four square within Chaney under the reviewability issue because Chaney, likewise, was -- rested on alternative legal grounds.
The FDA believed it lacked jurisdiction and policy grounds. And, secondly, it shows how this was plainly and eminently reasonable rescission, even if you disagree with us on the legal issue, because we've set forth separate and independent policy issues for the decision. So that was basically my first point. But even what you just read, General, in that key paragraph where the Secretary weighs the -- the -- the -- the reliance interests against the reasons in her memo, everything's wrapped up.
And we really don't know how she would have conducted that balance, how she would have weighed those two, if the legal had been taken away from it. I -- I simply disagree with that.
When she specifically says that she's setting forth separate -- separate and independent grounds justifying the rescission, I don't think that there's any fair way to read that but by saying that she would have rescinded it based on any of the independent grounds, which brings me -- Look at the independent grounds.
Number one -- number one, ""we should not adopt a policy of non-enforcement of those laws for broad classes and categories."" Okay.
And Congress she thinks agrees with us. Well, I don't know.
Maybe they do; maybe they don't.
But, aside from that, that -- that's a conclusion. Look at the second one: ""We should do it on a truly individualized case-by-case basis."" That's a conclusion.
That isn't a reason. And the third one is a reason.
The third one: ""It is important to project the message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear,"" et cetera, ""enforcement of immigration against all class"" -- that's an independent reason. With respect, may I finish? May I finish? Yes. I'm going to try to squeeze in two points in a single sentence. That's all right. Good luck.
I'm sorry. The first -- the -- the first point is that I very much disagree. All of those articulate the basic same policy rationale that this is a law enforcement agency. They are against general policies that actively facilitate violations of the law. And the last point I will make is, while we don't think you need to address the legality question if you agree with us on any of our other arguments, if you disagree with us on any of our other arguments, you absolutely must address the ultimate legality question because we simply cannot be forced to maintain a policy that this Court concludes that is illegal. So, if you decide to get there, then we do think that DACA is illegal and was justifiably -- was justifiably rescinded on that basis as well. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-161, the Department of Homeland Security versus Thuraissigiam. Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress established the expedited removal system in 1996 for aliens who arrive at our borders or enter illegally and have no entry documents.
Such aliens are clearly inadmissible and have no right to be in this country. Congress reasonably concluded that a full-blown removal hearing was not necessary to make that determination.
Congress was also concerned, however, for -- about the possibility for delay and abuse of the asylum system if every time such a clearly inadmissible alien sought asylum.
What it did then was to provide for a three-tiered administrative screening system to first determine whether the alien had a credible fear -- fear of persecution. Respondent contends that the Suspension Clause requires a fact-laden judicial review of the negative fear -- credible-fear determination made in that screening process. Congress, however, while it preserved habeas corpus, tailored it to the special circumstances of expedited removal by limiting it to whether the alien is eligible for expedited removal and whether such an order was entered. Congress's judgment that that approach was necessary for the control of immigration and control of the borders is entitled to great weight and it is consistent with the Suspension Clause. First, Congress has repeatedly said that an alien seeking admission is entitled only to the procedures Congress has provided.
And it has held for more than 100 years that Congress may vest the determination of whether an individual alien is excludable in an executive officer.
Indeed, it said that a determination by such an officer acting within his jurisdiction is due process for purposes of the Constitution.
And when such an order is issued under this system, that expedited removal order establishes the government's right to detain him. A fortiori, that is true when what -- when you have a situation involving an inadmissible alien who seeks review of a negative screening determination for possible relief from removal, notwithstanding his inadmissibility. Mr. Kneedler, it's one thing when an alien comes and has no protected ground to stay here.
There's no legal right to stay.
And so expedited proceedings are okay because they have no right to be here. But, when someone's seeking asylum, they have a statutory right to stay if they meet the elements of the statute.
So that's a vastly different question of whether the Suspension Clause -- which predated the Due Process Clause by 100 years -- the Suspension Clause, at the time, it was viewed as permitting anyone who had a legal claim to stay to file a habeas petition. I don't know how that right all of a sudden gets transformed merely because there's a second constitutional right to due process. Well -- Meaning those are two different provisions of the Constitution, one predated the other, and the finality era cases were very clear, if you have a claimed right to be in the United States, whether you're on the shore from a boat that's landed or you're from Puerto Rico and you think that your citizenship gives you a right to come in, a whole slew of cases from the finality era under the Suspension Clause who said you have a habeas right. So I don't know how that's the same thing.
You assume the person has no clear right, but they do have a right to stay if they meet the criteria of the Asylum Act. Several responses to that.
Those finality -- those finality era cases all uniformly hold that a court may not review a -- the determination in an individual case whether the alien has satisfied the conditions for removal. And -- and so -- and -- and the Court has held that Congress may vest that determination in an executive officer and that that is sufficient.
And for habeas corpus purposes, that sufficient determination establishes the executive's power to detain the individual. Suppose -- suppose that Congress passed a law which said -- we'll make it an alien who has been here for some time, but perhaps illegally, walking down the street and an officer picks him up and puts him in prison. And he would like to say to a court: Judge, the officer was wrong on the law.
He has no such right.
But we have a statute that says: Judge, you can only review whether he did order him put in prison.
Would you say that's consistent with the purpose of habeas, which, after all, since I guess the 17th century, 16th century, 15th century, maybe earlier, has said the purpose of habeas is to review the lawfulness of what the -- of what the officer has done, not to just review whether he ordered him put in jail.
And that right became a right of the people, not just the king. The king wanted to see if his officers were following the law.
Now they may have a lot of discretion and so forth, but, here, we have a statute which says: Judge, you cannot determine whether the officer has followed the law.
All you can determine is whether he issued an order saying keep him in jail or send him wherever or whatever. I mean, the inconsistency with habeas and the right of the people to bring it to see if the king's or the president's or whoever's officers are following the law would seem fairly seriously undermined, wouldn't it? Well, that is -- what you're describing is quite different from what we have here.
Again, Respondent, like any -- almost any alien in expedited removal, does not challenge the fact that he has no right to be in the country. What he -- what he seeks is review of a -- of a screening determination that he is -- doesn't have a credible fear entitling him to or enabling him to get relief, notwithstanding his inadmissibility. Yeah, he's saying I have a right to be here because I have a -- a claim for asylum. But it's -- it's very -- it's very different.
And there -- and no one has pointed to any -- anything at -- at -- at common law or in the finality determination cases of a situation where a person is inadmissible, concededly, but wants to receive relief from removal.
And that's significant. Asylum, for example, is the -- I guess I just don't understand this, Mr. Kneedler, because, on certain conditions, if he shows certain things, he has a right to asylum.
And what he's trying to get is a hearing that adequately determines whether he can show those things. Well -- So, you know, on certain conditions, he has a right to release. He has a right to live in this country.
And that's exactly what he's challenging -- But -- -- is whether -- is -- is his getting a fair hearing to determine that question. This is a very different context where someone is saying not that he has a right under domestic law to be in this country but that he -- he doesn't want to be sent back to another country because his -- of his fear of conditions there. This is directly like the rule of non-inquiry that has been applied for many, many years in extradition, which is one of the analogies that Respondent draws.
A court may not review the determination in the extradition context of the executive's determination about whether a person -- the treatment the person might experience in another country. But you don't contest, do you -- I guess I'm just not really quite understanding this argument, because you don't contest that, under this statute, if he shows certain things, he has a right to remain in this country as a -- per the asylum statute. Well, for -- again, asylum is discretionary.
He does not have a right under -- under the asylum statute.
And Congress, in affording a right to go through this screening process, was not required to attach to it judicial review. If -- if -- if Congress knew that was coming, maybe it wouldn't have provided for asylum at all.
And for withholding and CAT protection, as -- as was clear from the prior argument, that does not afford a right to be in this country.
It is simply a withholding of being sent to another country. This Court's unanimous decision in Munaf is very much on point in that respect. The Court there held that it is not for a court in habeas corpus, even involving a citizen, to review the conditions of the place where the person would be sent. Here, we have an alien in expedited removal who is assimilated to one at the border, who has no right to be in the country to begin with. He might.
I mean, there might be circumstances where, even on your argument, the claim is a claim that this particular judge, who is an immigration official, this particular individual behaved unlawfully, contrary to the Constitution. He didn't even come into the room. You've read their brief.
He did it for religious reasons.
He's against us.
He did it because -- I mean, there are certain claims that it's possible Congress cannot take away without, let's say, a hearing, which they've had, and the individual lost it. I'm having a hard time, because I can think of analogies distinguishing it from a case that's like this.
But what happened, he's walking down the street and thrown into jail. And -- and there, he claims, you know -- do you see the analogies? Well -- Tell me why there are no -- -- actually, I don't see the analogy because this is a very different and limited and focused context where an alien who -- who has entered illegally has no right to be in the country and, nonetheless, is asking for basically mercy under the statutes that Congress has enacted. Maybe that's it. But under the -- under the -- I -- I don't know. You'd have to at least, if he has a right to mercy under the statute -- look -- It's not -- it's not -- -- there are all the Chinese cases and so forth, you know, the Chinese exclusion cases and so forth, which analogizes it very much for habeas purposes in terms -- being put into jail, I mean, for habeas purposes.
And so, if you accept all those cases, then what? Even looking at it in that way, what those courts repeatedly hold, all the way back to the Court's decision in Ekiu more than 100 years ago, is the fact-finding, the -- the -- the -- whether the person as a matter of fact comes within the scope of the statute, may be committed entirely to an executive officer. And that is due process.
And once the executive officer acting within his jurisdiction makes that determination, that establishes the executive's ability to detain the person. And that is particularly true, as I say, where the question is not whether the person is entitled to come into this country because of domestic considerations but where the claim is based on please don't send me back to another country because of conditions in that country. And that is squarely, in addition, in the realm of the rule of non-inquiry, where Congress may, if it wants to, after a full removal hearing, it has provided for review of CAT claims and withholding claims. But this is a -- this is a -- a system deliberately designed by Congress to be a quick screening so that the system does not get bogged down in delay in which aliens would be here for a long period of time and maybe get released into the population because there's no sufficient bed space. What Congress did was try to accommodate the interest in affording a person to at least make a claim of asylum and the need for expedited removal by having the screening system. And what Respondent is seeking here is basically a fact-laden review.
No statutory interpretation question is involved here.
What he wants is a fact-laden review of the determination that he has not established a credible fear. Even in the context of whether an alien is excludable, that was not reviewable under the long line of this Court's decisions during the finality era, but, in addition, because of the nature of the -- of the screening involved here concerning fears of conditions in another country, a situation in which, again, this Court unanimously in Munaf held was not necessary -- did not have to be reviewed under habeas corpus for a United States citizen to -- Does -- does your -- -- examine the condition -- Sorry.
Does your constitutional principle change at some point based on how long the non-citizen has been in the country, even though unlawfully? Well, we think Congress is entitled to make a judgment about -- about how long the -- that period should be.
And Congress has established a two-year limitation. And we think that that judgment is entitled to great respect. Significantly, though, what's at issue here -- Is there an outer boundary to that, do you think? There -- there may well be, but I -- but, again, this is an act of Congress, and we think Congress's judgment along those lines should be respected. I wasn't going to bring it up, but I will.
Why? Why? The normal way, I think -- this is just my view -- but the normal way that courts have dealt with the kind of problem you're raising is you say something like: There's tremendous discretion on the part of the Executive Branch or sometimes it's a political question.
We won't even review it. But Boumediene says that the detainee has the right to go into court under habeas and to make his claim. Now the judge, which Boumediene didn't really talk about, may have tremendous discretion, may not, may say it's up to the Executive Branch, may say all the things that you said.
I don't know. But what you can't do, at least under Boumediene, is to take away his right to go into court and to make his claim to the judge. What is your response? My response is Congress did not take away habeas corpus.
Congress preserved habeas corpus.
And as Boumediene itself said, habeas is a flexible, adaptable remedy. And what Congress did here was tailor it to the specific circumstances of expedited removal.
Again, and -- and even -- even in the -- in -- under traditional habeas and immigration contexts -- I see. -- courts did not review factual determinations.
And, in particular, they should not be required to review -- Congress doesn't have to provide -- So is your -- so is your position, so I understand it -- let's assume -- and I'm borrowing Justice Breyer's assumption -- that there is an error of law, either of law or of fact -- application of facts to law. And I know you'll dispute that, mixed questions, but assuming there's a mixed question or there's an error of law, are you still saying that habeas relief is unwarranted, cannot be given? Because, as I understand this statute, there are only three reasons that you can get judicial review, and none of them have to do with errors of law. Yes.
We think Congress is not required by the Suspension Clause to provide for review of errors of law -- So how -- how do you -- -- in this -- in this context. All right.
So how do you deal with the finality -- the era cases? You're absolutely right that they said that fact-finding by the executive could be done by the executive.
But all of them presume that there was still a habeas right to challenge errors of law. Well, those cases don't actually hold in our view that the Suspension Clause required that.
But putting it to one side, they did not involve the situation here where what a person is -- is seeking is review not of a statutory right to come into the country because of domestic -- satisfying domestic requirements but review of a desire not to be sent to another country because of conditions here -- there. And we think that -- I'm sorry.
The whole idea of freedom -- life, liberty, and freedom, is -- and what the finality area -- era cases showed, is that you have a right to remain if you have a right to remain. And so, if they have a right, a legal right, a legal error's been committed with respect to asylum, it doesn't matter whether they're seeking release here or not to be turned back somewhere else, your freedom has been stopped.
That's what all of these Chinese exclusion cases were about, people at the shore, people who were stopped at a border.
The shore is equivalent to a border, so I -- I -- I -- I'm having trouble with your argument because you're turning around what the idea of habeas is. No. It's when the government stops your liberty of remaining -- Well -- -- if you have a right to remain.
You have a right not to go someplace else. -- I -- I -- I don't think the Court can look just at the finality cases, although we think they answer the question here because this is a fact-laden review. The Court also has to -- No, but you're going further now. No, but the Court also has to consider the rule of non-inquiry cases in which the Court has repeatedly held, all the way back to Neely, with a lineage as -- as old as our immigration laws, that habeas review is not available to review the conditions or what will happen to the person when he goes to another country -- That's not the issue. -- even for questions of law. The -- the focus is -- of habeas is not the issue of where you're going to be released to.
The issue is are you going to be -- be released here. But -- but -- but if someone -- So you're right. -- if someone is sought for extradition purposes and they are in the United States and -- and they are claiming don't send me to another country that has requested my extradition because of what the procedures will be there, what treatment I will be -- I will receive there, the rule of non-inquiry has sustained the ability of -- of Congress not to provide for judicial review.
And that was true in Munaf -- I guess I'm not -- -- in this Court's unanimous decision. -- quite understanding why that would be.
If you look at the finality era cases, these were people who had basically no connection at all to the United States, some who had not entered the country, not citizens, not nothing. And you're saying that they were entitled to a kind of proceeding that this person is not just because he has, you know, sort of the -- the best kind of claim you can make to stay in this country, which is that, if we turn you back, you'll be subject to torture or persecution? Why should that be -- person be treated less well in terms of the kinds of procedures he can invoke than the person in the finality era cases which had no connection at all and -- and -- and who had no fear of persecution or torture? Again, in the finality era -- era cases, the courts did not review the fact-based determination about whether someone came within the statute.
And they specifically did not include the situation where the -- where the claim is about conditions in another country.
In the -- in this Court's decision in Munaf, it might have been claimed that the Secretary of State was somehow misinterpreting CAT when he decided that the -- that the person should be -- or the Department of Defense, whoever -- stayed in an extradition case might be misunderstanding the interpretation of the treaty. But your -- But the Court didn't suggest -- -- your view, you know, does not only speak to pure factual matters.
Your view applies to legal matters and mixed questions as well. But there's no statutory interpretation question here.
But -- but just -- just to -- Well, there's a view as to whether the hearing officer filed the -- followed the appropriate procedures. But that is a fact-laden review that would require unpacking what happened, would require the -- the -- the -- the record -- Usually, we don't think that, you know, did you follow the law as to the procedural requirements that the law states as a fact-laden review. But -- We think it's a pretty common thing for courts to do. No -- It's like, did this executive officer follow the procedures that he was supposed to follow? No, the courts -- there are no decisions in the finality era that are pointed to that -- that provide for that kind of review.
But, again, in Munaf, in -- in -- But why should that kind of review be so different? I mean, that's a pretty basic question.
Did the executive officer follow the rules that he was supposed to follow? If I could just step back for a moment, the -- the -- the common law, the finality era cases, all the sources that are looked at, nothing affirmatively establishes a right of judicial review of this sort of screening determination that Congress decided could be attached to the expedited removal system.
And Congress's judgment in those -- in that situation should be entitled to great respect -- Mister -- -- especially against the background of the rule of non-inquiry. I -- I think you've been trying to make a point about Munaf, and I -- Yes. -- I wonder if you could tell me what it is. Yes.
No -- no, the -- the point is that there was no review in habeas of the determination that the person should be turned over to Iraqi authorities where the claim was, if I'm turned over there, that person -- you know, I may -- I may -- may be mistreated. Right.
So what is -- what is the analogy to this situation? The same thing here, where the person is saying: Don't -- don't -- I want a court to determine whether -- to review an executive determination as to whether I will be tortured in another country. And in Munaf, the Court didn't try to separate whether the executive had decided a question of law, a question of fact.
It was sufficient that the executive had made a determination regarding conditions in another country. Here, there's even less review because it's an initial preliminary screening to see whether the person has even made a credible-fear showing about conditions in another country. And we think that that is squarely within the realm of things that habeas corpus does not have to be available to second-guess the executive's determination. Otherwise, you could have considerable delay.
There are 9,000 -- as we point out in our brief, there are 9,000 negative credible-fear determinations that have been made in recent years, 100,000 credible -- credible-fear referrals. If judicial review is added on top of this, with close parsing of the limited administrative record that this process provides for, it would really bog down the system.
And we think Congress's judgment that that is not constitutionally required is entitled to great respect. Otherwise, you will have protracted proceedings.
It could -- it could lead to aliens being released into the country.
That, in turn, could create an incentive to come to the country and -- and be released and undermine the whole point of Congress enacting the expedited removal system. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gelernt. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute here eliminates any meaningful role for the courts, even to ensure that the statutes and regulations were followed. During the 60-year finality period, Congress also tried to exclude the courts, leaving only that review that was ""required"" by the Constitution. This Court, nonetheless, continued to review legal claims in habeas.
It did so while expressly rejecting the government's argument that deportation was not the type of restraint that triggers habeas.
It did so critically in cases to review statutory and regulatory limits, even where the Court expressly held that those particular non-citizens lacked constitutional procedural due process rights. It did so where the non-citizen was seeking initial entry, where the non-citizen was in the country illegally, and, most critically in response to what the government said, in cases where the non-citizen was removable and seeking only to challenge the denial of relief from removal. The finality era cases are consistent with the common law and answer each of the government's arguments.
The government has cited no common law support. Moreover, the government's undefined meaningful ties test is unworkable.
It would also mean that asylum seekers and potentially millions of other unknowns, non-citizens, inside the country could be summarily expelled without any judicial review or without even any administrative review. The Suspension Clause is a check on the political branches.
This Court has never before allowed the elimination of judicial review over the legality of deportations.
The Court once again should preserve habeas review as it did during the Chinese exclusion era, the finality era, and throughout the country's history. The political branches undoubtedly have enormous power in the immigration area, but the one thing it cannot do, and this Court has never allowed them to do, is remove a check on themselves. So I want to address what I -- what I see as the government's fundamental point now. Their opening brief made very broad arguments about having no habeas at all.
What they've retreated to now is, well, you were found inadmissible, you're in the country illegally, and you're only challenging relief, and no finality era addresses that. That's absolutely wrong.
And let me just give the Court two cases.
One is Accardi, decided the year after Heikkila v. Barber said the only review under this regime is that which is required by the Constitution. Accardi came into court and said, yes, I'm in the country illegally, but I'd like to apply for a discretionary form of relief that will allow me to stay in the country, suspension of deportation.
The Court reviewed it in habeas, found a regulatory violation, and sent the case back for a new hearing. Let me give you one other that involves refugees, Tod v. Waldman.
They came to this country seeking initial entry.
The general admissibility rule was you had to be literate. The Jewish refugees in that case said: But I'm -- we are refugees; therefore, we can stay, notwithstanding being illiterate.
The Court found that that was true on the merits and sent the case back for a new hearing. The critical conceptual point and the reason those cases are right -- and I think the government will concede this when they get up on reply -- is that the predicate for removing someone is both you have to find that they are removable and you have to find that the CFI process was conducted legally and they were legally denied the forms of relief to which they were applying in the CFI process. You may not remove a person until the CFI process is concluded.
The government will -- I think, has never disputed and will concede again that Mr. Thuraissigiam could not be removed based just on the inadmissibility. Congress has set up a system where you are allowed to apply for asylum, withholding, and Convention Against Torture relief. And I would -- I would note, importantly, that those latter two forms of relief are mandatory -- Well, what -- -- not discretionary. -- what's unusual about this situation is that your client really doesn't want to be released.
And the government makes this point over and over in its brief. The government could take him to the airport, give him a ticket and say, you are released, and he could leave.
That's not what he wants. And the fundamental point of habeas is to secure release from what's claimed to be unlawful executive custody. So what is your answer to that? Right.
So our client does ultimately want release, but what he has asked for is a new hearing, which is consistent with the way immigration works in criminal cases in habeas, what this called -- Court called conditional release, which is for the benefit of the government. He would be thrilled to just be outright released and have the order vacated. What he -- then he would be in this country, and he would apply for asylum affirmatively. Well, he wants to be -- he wants to be released in this country so that he can remain in this country.
He doesn't simply want to be released.
And, therefore, it does seem like what he wants is review of his entitlement to remain in this country, not simply what habeas provides, which is release from custody. Well, absolute, Your Honor, he wants review of the removal order, which entails custody.
The custody will be illegal if the removal order is.
But let me -- let me offer three points about this. The first is we think the government is raising an issue that's already ultimately been decided by this Court.
Congress began regulating immigration in 1875.
Soon thereafter, the government made the exact argument that they're making now. Well, this isn't really habeas.
We're just restraining you from coming in the country or restraining you from leaving.
And the Court specifically could not have been more specific in rejecting that argument.
That's the Nishimura Ekiu case in 1892.
It was the Chin Yow case a few years later.
And even before Ekiu was Jung Ah Lung.
For the next 60 years in finality, reviewed those cases. And the other point I would make about that is, if the government's right that habeas doesn't even apply to deportation, then even lawful permanent residents would not be entitled to habeas -- Well -- -- because the restraint point would be the same with respect to them. In the -- -- that's not what they're saying at all, though.
They're -- they're making a very clear distinction between inadmissibility and deportation in relying on Landon versus Plasencia and many other cases, so I think that's an overstatement of their position. So you're absolutely right, Justice Kavanaugh.
And I -- I'm simply responding to their independent argument, what they called an independent argument in the opening brief and trying to respond to Justice Alito's question that this isn't classic habeas. They do try and get out from under that by then going to a meaningful ties test and using Plasencia, so you're absolutely right. But, with respect to Justice Alito's question, those cases specifically answer it, the exact same arguments were made.
Ekiu could not have been more clear.
We know that we're simply -- you're simply asking to remain in the country, and they said that is nonetheless proper for habeas. But there's the -- just following up on Justice Alito's point and the government's reliance on it, Munaf does say that there they were not seeking simply release.
They wanted humanitary protection to get out of -- out of the country.
Release was the last thing they wanted. And -- and to -- this case is arguably the same since, again, the release could be provided under their normal practice to these individuals by taking them out of the country to another country.
They don't want that to happen.
They want to be released into the -- into the population.
And Munaf made, I think, pretty clear that that type of humanitarian release was not the purpose of -- of habeas. Well, Your Honor, a few -- a few points on that.
I think Munaf was different because they didn't want to be released where they were arrested, which was Iraq.
They came to Iraq.
They didn't want to be released there. What they wanted, I think as the opinion makes clear, is affirmative help from the United States to fly them back to the United States.
Our client simply wants release where he was arrested. Now the government says: Well, we can release him in Sri Lanka, but, of course, that would be denying him relief on the merits. That's exactly what he fears. And so I think what the government is sort of implying is: Well, you can get out of this, just simply give up.
I mean, if that were true, contempt cases wouldn't fall under habeas. I -- I think that the analogy that they press depends upon the fact that it's conceded that the individual does not have a right to be in the United States. Right.
And so no immigrant -- and I want to be clear about this -- has an absolute, substantive right to be in the United States.
And that's not what habeas does. The value of the Suspension Clause as the framers saw it was not to create rights but to ensure that the grave power of restraint is never used except in accordance with law.
So, if Congress were to limit, further limit statutory rights, maybe even take the momentous step of withdrawing from our refugee treaties, then they would be reducing -- but habeas would still lie to make sure that you are not restrained, except in accordance with positive law.
That's the value for the framers. So the government's discussion about he has no absolute right to be here is -- is sort of beside the point for habeas.
Habeas was not designed to create substantive rights.
It was to ensure that the -- the law was followed. And so I want to turn to what the government -- But -- but on the -- on the question of history, you make a point. But, on the question of precedent in Landon versus Plasencia -- and I just want to get your reaction to this, you know what sentence it is -- Justice O'Connor writing for eight justices says: ""The Court has long held that an alien seeking initial admission to the United States requests a privilege and has no constitutional rights regarding his application."" So that's a statement of law for eight justices.
Why is that statement wrong or, if it's not wrong, why doesn't it control here? Well, I -- I think what the Court was saying there, as we understand it, was specific to due process.
The entire case was about due process.
There was no question of judicial review or habeas. And I think what the Court was doing was distinguishing between different people at a port who had procedural due process rights. That was the context of the sentence.
I think it would be a -- For context, the sentence says no constitutional rights. Right.
But I think it would be a lot in a case that didn't involve judicial review to take one sentence and say we're wiping away all the finality era cases. We're not discussing them. The difference between due process and habeas is stark.
As Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the Suspension Clause predated due process. Due process and habeas have never been hinged in this Court's cases. So you take Mizai and Knauff, which established no procedural due process for people at the ports.
They expressly held that they didn't have procedural due process, but then they went on in habeas to review the statutory and regulatory claims. They had very few statutory and regulatory claims on the merits, but the courts still reviewed them to make sure that the positive law was being followed. But wasn't it true in the -- in the finality era cases that the individuals, once it was determined that they had not been properly detained, they did have a right to be in the United States, because, in those -- in that era -- for most of that era, or much of that era, there were not very many restrictions on immigration to the United States.
And that's the difference between that case and this case. Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, I think for -- for two reasons.
One is the -- the inadmissibility of relief point, as I said before, there were finality era cases. That's the Accardi case, suspension of deportation, even though they were concededly removal.
That's Tod v. Waldman, even though the refugees were -- were illiterate and therefore inadmissible.
They were excused from that. But the other point is that the Court throughout the finality era always reviewed whether they fell within the statute or not. That's the Gegiow case, Ekiu.
All of those finality era cases were looking at whether they fell within the statute. There were restrictions.
I mean, obviously, there weren't as many as now, but there absolutely were restrictions on all the cases we cite on pages 13 through 15 of our brief, are all cases where the Court is looking at did they fall within the statute or the regulations. In any of those cases -- and it's -- it's -- did the court say anything more than -- when relief was granted, did they -- was the relief anything other than you are released? Well, absolutely.
And so the relief -- Other than Accardi and the other case you cited. Right. Which are -- which are in a -- perhaps in a category of their own.
But in -- for most of those finality era cases, wasn't the relief just you are released? No, Your Honor.
Those cases established the principle in immigration that the government would get the benefit of a new hearing, that they didn't simply have to release the person and let them go, that there would be a new hearing where there was a legal defect the government could potentially fix. So that's in addition to the cases -- Yeah.
Okay.
But at the end of that -- -- Muler, Johnson. Right. -- at the end of that, the relief -- is there any indication at the end of the whole process, what the person would get, what the alien would get, is anything other than release, which is what habeas provides? Well, that's -- that's what would happen here, Your Honor.
So we would -- if we had a new hearing and passed, we would be able to apply in a full hearing for asylum or withholding.
And if we won, he would be allowed to remain in the country. The reason we're not asking for full release is not because for -- it's for our benefit.
It's for the government's benefit. What this Court said in Boumediene is the Court doesn't have to, in habeas, permit -- permit full release.
It can give the government another chance. So the cases are legion in -- on our brief of where they sent it back for a new hearing.
Maybe the person failed and then was deported.
Maybe they passed and were allowed to stay.
But it would be a new hearing. Doesn't -- Counsel -- Just on -- on that particular thing, it seemed to me in the discussion, not so much from the brief, that the government, taking the Chinese cases and so forth, was saying, but, of course, he can seek a writ of habeas corpus.
Of course, he can. Now we're before the judge on the writ.
What's your argument, the judge says. And then I think their point is that he can't argue that there was a factual mistake below. Now, if you read the statute, it says he can't argue anything. Right. It says all he can say is, was there or was there not a notice.
So that can't be right, I don't think.
But, as applied to your case, maybe there is some kind of -- of limitation on the extent to which the judge can look at the factual findings, et cetera.
That's quite different from saying none at all. All right.
If we take that view, should we then send it back to the Ninth Circuit -- or was it the Ninth? Yeah.
Okay.
Send it back to whatever circuit in order for them to determine whether, under this statute, how it applies, does it mean since nobody can make any argument, no matter how outlandishly the service acted, let them work out in the first instance whether there's room for limitations on what kinds of arguments you can make, how much discretion. Right. What -- what would -- what do you think of that? Yeah.
So -- so I think you -- I want to answer all the different -- Yeah. -- things packed into your question.
I think a remand to flesh out our particular claims would not be inappropriate since the court of appeals and district court didn't unpack our particular claims. But I want to address two -- two other points that you made.
One is in the Martinez brief, which was -- Martinez was the companion case to Heikkila v. Barber -- and I would just refer the Court to the -- to the SG's brief in that case -- the government was very clear that the Suspension Clause requires some review, that the finality era statutes limited review to the constitutional requirement.
The government says, well, we conceded only statutory claims. That's even more than I understand them to be conceding now.
But they also lopped off part of the quote, which was ""anything contrary to law."" That's on page 20 of their brief. The point about the facts, I think, is a critical one, because Mr. Kneedler kept saying ""fact-laden."" So I think that's conspicuous in that he's not saying historical facts.
He knows we are not challenging the historical facts.
We don't claim a right to challenge the historical facts. Our position is twofold.
One is that, during the finality or contrary to what the government said respectfully, the courts routinely reviewed mixed questions.
That's the Rowoldt case, where the Court said: Look, you have to be meaningfully associated with the Communist Party, and then went on to look extensively at the facts.
What did he do at the Communist bookstore? What was the purpose? Those are the cases on page 50 of our brief, mixed questions. But the -- the more fundamental point I want to make is we are okay if the Court wants to reserve whether all application of law to fact is reviewable.
Our -- our point here is that there has to be review at least for gross misapplications of the statute because, at that point, where no one reasonably could conclude that on these historical facts you didn't meet the statutory standard, at that point, what you're seeing is really a misunderstanding of the legal standard. What are the concrete issues that could be raised on habeas in this case? So, Your Honor, our two principal claims are statutory and regulatory. And let me -- let me deal with the statutory claim. What we're saying is, on these historical facts, no asylum officer could reasonably have concluded that he did not meet the low significant possibility standard, the very low standard, which is a significant possibility of ultimately satisfying the asylum standard, which in itself is just a one-in-ten chance. And I'm going into the merits now, but the reason we say that we are okay with a standard that says egregious error, clear error, no reasonable adjudicator, because, at that point, you are reaching a legal error, is because the asylum officer, by statute, is required to look at the reports on country conditions. Every report, as the amicus briefs from the asylum experts and the Sri Lanka experts point out, there is an exact M.O. in how Tamil people are persecuted in Sri Lanka.
They -- men arrive in a white van.
They abduct the person.
They blindfold the person.
They beat and torture him.
The asylum officer in our case accepted every one of those historical facts but yet still said he didn't even meet the low significant possibility standard.
That's impossible. So, if this Court were to send it back and say, at least where there's a legal error, which means the misapplication was so egregious that there had to be a misunderstanding of the legal standard, that would satisfy us.
We would prevail.
We do believe that the historical cases show application of law to fact was routinely reviewed, always even where they were fact-laden, but that is not necessary in our case. But the -- see, what you've just said illustrates how far-reaching the argument that you are making is, because, as I understand it, there was nothing in the administrative record -- now maybe your client didn't understand what was going on, but all he said was that people drove up and they beat me. And that's it. And he -- the officer said: Are you a member of a political party? And he said no. So that -- you're saying that, on those facts, knowing nothing more than the fact that he was beaten up in Sri Lanka and he's a Tamil, that that's enough to provide that -- that provides a sufficient basis for asylum? Right.
Well, so -- so two -- two things, Justice Alito.
One is that, of course, the merits are not up here, and if we lose, we lose.
But I do want to point out that there were far more facts that showed he precisely fit the pattern. And I would also say, just to put a pin in it, that the amicus briefs show why people from Sri Lanka or other countries would not either understand what was being asked or want to reveal that it was the government. But it was much more specific than that.
It was men in a van.
That's -- that's what's always used.
It's called the white van phenomena.
He repeatedly said he thought he was arrested.
He was blindfolded.
That's part of the M.O. So it was the exact pattern.
That's why we think we could prevail.
But, ultimately, this Court just needs to decide is there habeas review and at least for legal errors where the egregious -- the application was so egregious that there had to be a misunderstanding of this thing. I want to focus also on -- Can I -- can I just -- Yes. -- I want to understand the limits of your theory.
I thought the court below said there had to be habeas relief for review of facts and law.
Are you disavowing the broadness of my understanding of what the -- the court below said? I would just put it as I read the court of appeals' decision differently and that -- Okay. -- there was not review of historical facts.
And we are not pressing that.
Nor the exercise of discretion.
We believe mixed questions, legal claims and constitutional claims, but, again, even if this Court wants to narrow it to only egregious -- egregious application, because I'm still -- Why are you using the word ""egregious""? Where -- that almost seems like whole cloth.
It's either mixed or not. Well, Your Honor, I think if you wanted to say for this -- purposes of this case only legal claims and reserve whether mixed questions.
I'm simply saying that when it becomes so egregious, when no adjudicator could reasonably have concluded on these facts that it met the standard, I think at that point, it would be a legal error because it would be a misunderstanding, because I think what this Court has pointed out in the past is you can't just have the adjudicator put boilerplate language for the standard, because then you really don't know.
I mean, someone who's writing an opinion over and over about the same things will get the standard -- at least boilerplate, get it right. Here, it's even worse because these are preprinted forms with the standard.
So you'll really never actually know if the asylum officer is understanding what these statutory terms mean, except through the application. And at some point, where the application is so -- either no reasonable adjudicator, clear error, egregious, I think that does rise to a legal error. I -- I want to also make a point about -- May I just ask you, if you're not trying to get any mileage out of the fact that the alien was on U.S. soil, he didn't have any documentation, he surreptitiously got here, you're not distinguishing him because he managed to get to U.S. soil from somebody who never got here, who was never in the United States in the first place? We -- we are distinguishing them, Your Honor. You are? We -- we believe someone outside the country, unless for some reason U.S. forces were overseas restraining him, and that would be a different situation.
That's not the typical deportation. I think if they were outside the country, they wouldn't be restrained because they would have -- and there might also be extraterritoriality issues. We're simply saying where the person is on U.S. soil and the body controls.
And so -- And does that -- that cover the person who comes to the port of entry and is stopped there? Yes, Your Honor.
And so I -- I may have misunderstood. Yes what? Your concession or -- or not? I'm sorry, Your Honor? I -- I didn't understand your ""yes."" Is it that the person at the port of entry is covered or not covered by your position? They are covered by habeas, and the reason is because the ports of entry are typically on U.S. soil.
An airport or even a land port will generally be 100 feet or so into U.S. soil. Do you think there's a way of distinguishing that case from yours? I think, historically, the Court has not for habeas.
I think the Court could reserve questions about people at ports because our person entered the country. Historically, the Court has said habeas applies when you're in U.S. soil.
At ports, it's a different procedure, for procedural due process, because that's more context-specific, and the Court has drawn a line for due process purposes at least between people who have entered and people at the port.
I think Your Honor could reserve that question on habeas for this case because our person did enter -- But -- but -- -- the country and it wasn't at a port. -- that's a significant expansion, it seems to me, from someone who's here, and anybody can get to a port of entry, right? Well, Your Honor, so -- so that goes to, I think, the burden.
I mean, there are 9,000 cases in the universe that could have been in habeas.
The government points out, in their -- in their reply, they go to 100,000. Well, those are people who -- who didn't need habeas because they passed.
So we're talking about 9,000 -- 9,000 people.
I -- I was -- That includes the people at -- at a port of entry? Yes, it does, Your Honor.
And so what I would -- give the Court a couple of statistics about that.
Since the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling, and that's basically a year ago now, there have been as our count 9500 people who failed their CFI and who could have filed a habeas under our rule.
Only 30 have.
One-third of one percent, three out of every thousand. The reasons are practical.
People are removed so quickly.
They're at the border. They can't find lawyers.
Even in regular immigration proceedings, pro se from an immigration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals is only three percent.
It's much harder at the border. The other thing that will happen is the district courts will lay down some standards.
Whatever non-profits are filing habeas will know we can't challenge historical facts.
We can't challenge credibility.
Your -- your claim is frivolous.
We're not going to file it. And you get no mileage out of filing because there's no automatic stay of removal. So just by filing doesn't mean you'll get to stay -- Can I -- -- in the country. -- can I pick up on the Chief Justice's question? You're saying a non-citizen who arrives at a port of entry, has never been in the United States, not lawfully admitted to the United States, nonetheless has a right under the U.S. Constitution to judicial review of the executive's decision to say they're not admissible? Right.
So let me -- let me make two points. Is that correct? Yeah, I think it's -- yes, Your Honor, sorry, the answer is yes.
The reason is from the finality era cases, that's the very first finality era case.
And, in fact, most of the cases, someone at a port of entry -- that's Nishimurh/Ekiu -- comes by boat, gets here, wants to be admitted.
The Court says no review of facts, which is the part of the opinion that the government was quoting, doesn't quote the second part, which is undoubtedly there has to be habeas for the -- for the review of the legality. The point I want to point out -- the reason I'm using the 9,000 number and the reason the government's using that is because those are the asylum numbers.
People who come here as a tourist reach a port and say, I'd like to go to Disneyland, they're not going to sit in detention and file a habeas if someone says, no, you're a tourist visa.
That's why judicial review has been available forever at a port, but you don't see mountains of -- of habeas cases. Well, I don't think this concerns -- There's just no grounds -- I don't think the concern is people who come here to go to Disneyland. Well, I -- I think the people who come here and don't have asylum claims or those type of claims and are clearly inadmissible are not going to file habeas petitions.
No one's going to file them because there's not going to be a ground to stay here. That's the reason in asylum cases people file them, but it's all -- it's -- again, as a practical matter, it's not very many, 30 out of 9500, since the Ninth Circuit.
That's the country-wide, 30 out of 9500. The other point I want to make about the burden is the district courts will be able to dispose of these very quickly.
They don't have to review credibility determinations. They're not reviewing historical facts. The administrative record is puny.
In -- in the printed booklets here, it's 28 pages. It's about a seven-minute read.
The only other thing they would look at, which is subsumed within the record, is the few pages of country reports on Sri Lanka, which would have told them if someone's abducted in a van and blindfolded, that is almost certainly by the government forces seeking to persecute Tamils on -- on political grounds. You're -- you're reviewing mixed questions, though, correct? But only as part of the record, which, again, is very, very small. That's very -- that's very difficult in many cases, though.
I don't know that that's going to be that easy. Well, I think certainly there's going to be deference, but I think, Your Honor, even to decide our case, we are -- we are okay with you saying not every mixed question where we have a difference of judgment needs to be reversed. But at least where it's so egregious that you can't possibly have under -- understood the standard, we believe we go back to district court and the district court looks at the few pages from the U.S. State Department reports on Sri Lanka, there is no way that the -- the district court could say, well, the asylum officer clearly understood what was going on. Maybe the asylum officer didn't think he could use circumstantial evidence and, therefore, made dispositive our client not telling him who persecuted him.
If that's true, that's a pure error of law. But either way, at some point, the egregious standard, because I don't think the government gave you a clear answer on even -- and this goes back to Justice Breyer's question to me on exactly what's reviewable. The government's talking about fact-laden questions, but what if they just didn't give you a hearing at all? What if they didn't give you a translator? What if they said we're not going to give you asylum because of your religion, your race? The government is taking the position that even those errors are not reviewable.
That cannot possibly be.
The Suspension Clause -- sorry. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Your Honor. Five minutes, Mr. Kneedler. Yes, several points. First of all, by our count, since the Ninth Circuit's decision, there have been 100 habeas cases filed, and the -- the potential for a flood would be, of course, far greater if this Court holds that there is a right to file a habeas seeking review of a negative credible-fear determination. This Court's decision in St. Cyr referred to review of pure questions of law and constitutional claims, in other words, statutory interpretation.
And the -- the finality era cases really fit into that mold even -- even where they do apply. There's no suggestion that when the Court said that Congress could vest the determination of -- of inadmissibility, much less a -- not passing a credible-fear screening for somebody who's inadmissible, but even -- even for determining excludability, Congress didn't -- or the Court didn't suggest there was an exception for something that might be characterized as an egregious misapplication or -- or review of the facts. We're still going to my basic question to you earlier.
Putting aside his claim, let's talk about a pure legal claim, they didn't hold any interview with me at all. I'm sorry? I -- I didn't -- They didn't hold an interview with me at all. The -- Is there habeas relief in that case? A pure matter of law.
The statute requires -- Well, it's not a pure matter of law.
The question of whether there was a hearing is -- there's a factual element to that.
But there -- this system at the administrative level builds in protections for that.
There's supervisory review.
There -- Counsel -- -- there are forms for notice. -- you're nitpicking.
Get to the point. No, I don't think -- Which is a pure -- -- I don't think -- -- question of law. I -- I don't think there -- Would there -- No. -- be habeas relief? I -- I think the answer is no.
And one could say the same thing in -- with respect to the finality -- So why -- -- era cases. -- bother doing anything? What -- what good is the statutes? What good are the regulations? Congress determined that -- that habeas should be limited in -- in -- in this context, again, for credible -- specifically with respect to credible-fear determinations. There's no common law precedent for this.
There's no finality era precedent for this.
And in that context, Congress's judgment should count for something. Now I also want to point out that, as I understand Respondent's claim -- Shouldn't the Court count for something? Hasn't it been under -- This Court has never -- has never -- -- under -- -- has never -- -- under the habeas? This Court has never said that.
And, again, Munaf -- Mr. Kneedler? I'm sorry. Could you answer, Mr. Kneedler? Mr. Kneedler, let me finish my question. Yeah, sorry. We have the great writ.
It was there to ensure that the executive acts according to law.
What's left if you tell me that there are laws, but there's no judicial review of whether those laws are being followed or not? That's my question. And -- and -- and my answer is Munaf and -- and -- and the 100-year-old precedent that Munaf stood for, where a determination about whether somebody should return to another country because of conditions there is simply a -- It's not returning.
He was there.
The question was a legal one, which was whether or not he should be turned over by the American forces or not.
The court said, even if he should have been, we're not going to step in in this situation. But the -- but the court drew on the rule of non-inquiry, which applies in the extradition context, which is about sending someone out from the United States to another country. I want to make another point.
When Respondent talks about review for egregious errors, I think he's talking about bringing in stuff that is outside the administrative record and trying to demonstrate to the Court that if only the review -- the asylum officer or the IJ had looked at this, it would have reached a different conclusion. That is -- that goes far beyond even traditional administrative review.
But the administrative proceedings in this case, for example, the asylum officer's record are just notes.
They're not a verbatim transcript.
They are there to assist the immigration judge in this self-contained internal review of whether someone has made even the showing necessary for a threshold credible-fear screening. They are not designed for judicial review.
And the suggestion that there would be judicial review in habeas corpus, unprecedented under this Court's decisions or the common law, would -- would require effectively to change the administrative system as well, but Congress determined that the -- that the three-tier screening that it provided and limited judicial review is necessary, is essential to get control of the nation's borders. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1195, Espinoza versus the Montana Department of Revenue. Mr. Komer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case asks whether the Federal Constitution allows the wholesale exclusion of religious schools from scholarship programs.
It does not. Yet, Montana's Blaine Amendment requires that exclusion.
As a result, the Blaine Amendment discriminates against religious conduct, beliefs, and status in violation of the free-exercise clause under Trinity Lutheran. The Montana Supreme Court disagreed.
That court held that barring religious schools from the program did not violate the Federal Constitution.
This Court should reverse that judgment. Even Respondents now concede that excluding religious schools from the program is unconstitutional, but they argue that the court avoided this discrimination by invalidating the entire program.
This is wrong.
The only reason the court invalidated the program was because it included religious schools. And the court's remedy did not cure its discriminatory judgment, nor should the remedy shield the judgment from review. Petitioners brought this lawsuit because they were denied scholarships based on religion, and they are still being denied scholarships based on religion.
If the court had shut down the program because it included Muslim schools or African-American schools, there's no question that would be unconstitutional.
We ask you to reverse. Respondents argue in the alternative that Locke allows them to exclude the religious schools and that this case falls within the play in the joints.
But that would allow the exception to swallow the rule.
As Trinity Lutheran made clear, the rule is religious neutrality and Locke only a narrow exception. We argue that Locke is the exception that proves the rule. In Trinity Lutheran -- May -- may I ask you some threshold questions about Article III standing? Under the Montana judgment, these parents are treated no differently than parents of children who are going to secular private schools, so where is the harm? When a differential is challenged, the court inspecting the state law can level up or level down.
And here it leveled down.
So these would be parents of children going to secular private schools.
How are you harmed? Your Honor, the Montana Supreme Court lacked the necessary predicate for leveling up or for leveling down because they got the federal Supreme Court question wrong. But for getting that question wrong, we would never have moved on to the issue of remedying that problem because it isn't a constitutional problem. But there's another serious problem, and that's the parents are not taxpayers.
Taxpayers are the people who contribute to these student scholarship organizations. And this Court has held that there is no standing to challenge somebody else's tax status.
It seems to me that the Court's decision in Eastern Kentucky is very close to this one, and the Court said you say you're injured because these hospitals are not providing -- providing services to you, but you are not the taxpayer and you can't complain about the tax treatment of someone else. So how do you distinguish Eastern Kentucky? Well, Your Honor, here what's involved is a scholarship program, and the scholarship program's intended beneficiaries are the parents, like our clients, who are enabled to exercise their constitutional right to choose -- They're challenging the tax status of someone else, not themselves. No -- no, Your Honor, it's because the Montana Supreme Court has extended their Blaine Amendment to include scholarships that are generated by the giving of tax credits -- I'm sorry.
Is there any case we've ever had where we've recognized a tax -- a -- a party who wasn't either the taxpayer or the direct recipient of the taxes, benefits of the taxes? So here the parents not just aren't the taxpayer; they're not the schools that receive the money.
Neither are they guaranteed receipt of the money.
We're told that there's less money than applicants. So they're like three levels removed. In what other case can you cite for me have we permitted such a removed party to have standing? I -- Your Honor, I don't think that we've had a state constitutional provision ever be applied in such a -- It doesn't matter that -- -- extended fashion. -- we've had -- we've had a case involving schools that discriminate, and we've said that those schools -- that taxpayers -- not taxpayers -- that individuals who feel affected by that discrimination don't have standing because they're not the people -- they're not the taxpayer and they're not the recipient of the discrimination directly, so -- and I'm -- I'm having a problem understanding how you have standing either for the taxpayer or for the school who receives the money. Well -- And why -- you have a lot of contingencies.
Other -- that taxpayers won't give the $150 without the tax credit, that the school will actually pick them, and that even if picked in the past, that they'll be picked in the future. It seems a high level of contingencies.
So mention one case that comes close to that. Any case that involves Article III standing where the intended beneficiaries of the program are -- The school's the intended beneficiary. I -- I -- respectfully, Your Honor, I disagree.
The financial benefit from a scholarship program is to the families. The families receive the benefit of the scholarship.
The scholarship is used by the families to buy the education -- Counsel -- -- at the school. -- the financial benefit is to the taxpayer who gets a tax credit. Actually -- That's the intent. It's an incentive for the taxpayer to give money, but there are many incentives that incentivize people to give money. Yes, Your Honor, it does incentivize donations.
That's its purpose.
And it actually succeeded, while the program was going, in awarding scholarships to two of our three client families.
And -- How do you know that they wouldn't have been in the same situation? After all this is a small credit. It's $150.
And if they don't get the credit, if the donors to the organizations don't get the credit, they still get a tax deduction.
And that tax deduction is uncapped. So how can we even assume that there's going to be less money in the kitty if the credit is removed but the tax deduction remains untouched? And I'm looking at Wright against Allen in Eastern Kentucky and I just don't understand how this case passes the standing bar when those didn't. Well, Your Honor, the simple fact of the matter is that our clients received scholarships under this program, which was a financial benefit to them.
The -- the -- the tax deductions are not a financial benefit to the taxpayer because they are out $150, whether they pay their tax to the state or they donate $150 to the scholarship organization. There's no financial benefit to them. It's kind of a psychic benefit.
But it creates scholarships.
It really created scholarships. And -- Mr. Komer, can I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question? And I don't know whether to call it standing or mootness or anything else, but I guess I am having trouble seeing where the harm in this case is at this point.
It's a strange kind of posture wherein, but if you would describe to me what is the harm that the parents are suffering right now currently? Well, right now, their students -- two of the families' students are on scholarships and next year they won't be -- Right.
But I guess -- -- generated by the program. I'm sorry to interrupt.
I guess what I'm -- I'm saying is that because of the supreme court's ruling, whether you go to a religious school or you go to a secular private school, you're in the same boat at this point. So I've always understood in these kinds of cases that the harm is the perceived or alleged or actual -- whatever you want to call it -- discrimination. But there is no discrimination at this point going on, is there? Yes, there is.
Because the discrimination occurred in the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court which considered a federal question, which led to the invalidation of the program.
And they -- But it led to the invalidation of the entire program as it related both to private secular schools and private religious schools. So a -- a -- a -- a -- the parents of both are affected in the exact same way. That's because the remedy -- you can't let the remedy shield the discriminatory judgment.
The discriminatory judgment is in mistakenly believing that this Blaine Amendment and the application of it did not violate the Federal Constitution. If they got that question right, we wouldn't be here.
Because the program would still be going on and our parents would be -- I'm sorry, how could that be? Meaning, do you -- are you taking the position that as a matter of constitutional law, the Montana Supreme Court constitutional provision is unconstitutional? That -- that states are forced to give money, tax credits, to religious institutions and secular institutions? Are they required always to give money out, scholarships? No.
No, Your Honor. All right.
So let's start there.
Are you saying that the constitutional -- the constitution is unconstitutional? Meaning that the constitutional -- Montana's constitutional provision is unconstitutional. Montana's constitutional provision violates the free-exercise clause on its face. On its face. And as applied to this program. So you are saying that states are forced to give money both to secular and religious schools? It -- not to the schools. This is a case about giving the money to the families.
It's not a case about -- I don't -- -- giving money to the schools. Secular and religious families? Yes, if they give to one, they must give to the other. But can the state choose not to give at all? Yes. All right.
So let's -- if you start from that proposition, the Montana court said we don't have a law now, don't give to any. So let's assume that the Montana court did what you wanted it to do and said: This is unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution, and it's unconstitutional under the Montana Constitution, which is what I think it did, by the way.
It said it's unconstitutional under both, even if it didn't say it, but let's assume it. Let's assume it says it's unconstitutional under the federal constitution. You're saying they can't say separately it's unconstitutional under the Montana Constitution? They have to keep the program alive? In the circumstances we're dealing with, Your Honor, they terminated the program. I'm not talking about the circumstances.
Let's assume their opinion was written exactly the way you want it to be, and they had said, this violates the Federal Constitution, but it also violates the Montana Constitution. So instead of leveling up the way Justice Ginsburg said, we're going to level down.
That way it doesn't violate either of them.
It -- we stopped the federal violation because we're not discriminating against the school -- any school.
And we've now -- not violating the Colorado Constitution. Can they do that? Are we talking about the court doing this or -- To the court doing this. Can the court do it, no? Why? Because when you have a constitutional conflict between the two constitutions, the Federal Constitution trumps -- But you just told me the Federal Constitution doesn't stop the state from choosing not to give aid. That's right.
But here the state chose to give aid and it has been stopped from giving aid to our clients. Well, it chose to give aid consistent with the constitutional amendment.
And -- and -- and the constitutional amendment sets restrictions on funds. And, as a result of the restrictions on funds that the constitutional amendment set, in this case, which I have always understood to be a challenge to the way that the constitutional amendment operated on a particular program, as a result of this challenge, what has happened is that neither the parents who want to send their children to religious schools nor the parents who want to send their children to secular schools get what they would like to get. So they're both being treated the same way. Only as a result of a mistaken understanding of the free-exercise clause, Your Honor. Under -- But we don't usually -- -- under -- go ahead. I mean, we don't usually sort of grade every line of an opinion. Usually we look to an opinion, and -- and -- and -- and there's a decision below, and it's had a consequence in the world. And the consequence of this decision is that there is no discrimination, that neither -- that neither set of parents is getting what it -- they want. Now, you might say, well, both should get what they want, and maybe that would be a better world.
Maybe.
But the constitutional harm that it seems that you have to allege here is the discrimination.
And there is no discrimination. Your Honor, there is no discrimination because the Montana constitutional provision requires discrimination on its face and as applied to our clients.
And, if I can point out, this isn't a decision about harmonizing the two constitutions because the Montana Supreme Court did not recognize there was any conflict between them that had to be harmonized at all. Justice Alito? Yeah, I just wanted to ask this simple question: Under our decision in Village of Arlington Heights, is it constitutional for a unit of state government to do something that it could do, but if it does it for an unconstitutional discriminatory reason, is it then unconstitutional? Yes, it is, Your Honor.
I see the light is on. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Montana Supreme Court held that the Montana constitution requires religious discrimination that the federal constitution forbids.
Parents may not direct scholarships to schools solely because those schools are religiously affiliated. Now, the state doesn't defend that error of federal law, but says it was washed away when the court invalidated the entire program and left everyone empty-handed. The Montana Supreme Court had no power under federal law to invalidate anything.
It relied on a state constitutional provision that is inconsistent with and preempted by the federal free-exercise clause, and, crucially, Petitioners continue to suffer from that federal free exercise violation regardless of whether any parents received scholarships or also suffer as collateral damage. If the Montana Supreme Court had invalidated this program because it included historically African-American schools or all-girl schools, that would be a straightforward equal-protection violation. Nothing about it would be cured by the fact that other parents had been denied funding as well. So your -- your -- I'm sorry.
Oh, you're good. The injury flows through the schools, right? I mean, the money would go to the schools, not to the parents.
And we don't have a school in this case. Well, but I think that's really getting at the standing issue, Mr. Chief Justice.
And they're losing their scholarships at the end of the school year, as I understand it.
They've had them for years, and under the court's decision, they lose them at the end of this school year.
So even I don't take the state to be challenging Article III injury. And so then it's just a question of whether they're raising their own rights and they are because the reason they're being excluded from the program, everybody would say, the answer to the question, why don't these parents get their scholarships, because they want to direct the scholarships to religious schools. Their free exercise is being penalized.
They're not raising a right on behalf of the state.
Everybody concedes that if all the parents in this program had wanted to choose secular schools, there'd be no basis for the state's court ruling.
The scholarship program would still exist.
It's only because some parents said I want to send my kids to schools like Stillwater, and at that point, at page 30 of the Petition Appendix, the state supreme court says we have a state constitutional guarantee, no state funds to religious schools.
That's what it says. And that's a straightforward violation of -- Mr. Wall -- -- federal law. -- are you claiming that -- what you're calling Blaine amendments, but that the Montana provision and all the other states that have one, that as a matter of federal constitutional law, all of those constitutional -- state constitutional provisions must be struck? Well, not the entire category because I actually think it's a little more nuanced than that, but I am saying what the Court said in Trinity Lutheran.
Seven members of the Court said the free-exercise clause there compelled what two members of the Court said in your dissent, Justice Sotomayor, the Establishment Clause forbade. Yes, we think the same is true here. There are 37 -- That's a radical decision. I -- We have -- we have a founding father, Madison, lobbying heavily for the free-exercise clause and equally to stop states from both establishing religions or using public funds to support them. There's been over -- since the founding fathers, a long history of people who for non-discriminatory reasons, but for reasons related to their belief in the separation of church and state, that have taken the position that the state should not give money to religious institutions. You are suggesting now that Montana in 1972 went through an empty exercise, they looked at the history of this amendment or one like it, said it was odious, admitted -- some of its people who voted for this bill in '72 said it was a despicable history, but they then looked at the founding fathers' writings, they looked at the State of Montana's religious tolerance, which had changed dramatically from the Blaine Amendment era, and decided that they were going to side with James Madison, one of the fathers of our Constitution, and continue to say we don't want aid to churches. So -- so -- Now -- Perhaps you could comment, counsel. So, Justice Sotomayor, that was one of two points I was hoping to make on the merits before I sat down.
Every time that the state points to that in its brief, and I think most notably at pages 30 and 31, and what Madison was talking about in the Remonstrance were compelled support laws, preferential aid to the church. Even the state admits at page 30 of their brief, and these are the state's words: There is zero founding era evidence that there -- that you could have a generally available benefit and deny it to an institution based on its religious character -- What about -- what about -- MR. WALL -- and Justice Thomas, I think, walks through the history of the opposite in his Rosenberger concurrence, that at the time of the founding, when they gave out land in the Northwest Territory and other statutes for -- to schools, they included religiously affiliated schools. I think actually the tradition that dates to the founding is -- is sort of the opposite, that you can't disqualify them just based on their religious character, but you can have no compelled support, no preferential aid to the church.
And that's very different from what -- what's going on here. But what -- what did you think of this? I -- I'm having trouble, and I want you to tell me what you really think about this problem which has probably an answer that you will have thought about.
Okay. Say in San Francisco or Boston or take any city or state, and they give many, many, many millions of dollars to the public school system.
And a lot of them give a lot of money to charter schools. Now, they don't give money to Catholic schools.
All right? Now, if -- if we decide you're right, does that all change? Well, no, in certain respects it doesn't change, Justice Breyer. They don't -- if they want to open up the funding, they can put limits, secular limits, on the program.
We're going to give math scholarships or engineering scholarships -- There's -- I'm not talking about scholarships. But if -- I'm talking about the X billion dollars that the State of New York spends on the public school system, and I don't know how much, but I suspect they might spend money on charter schools. Yes. Let's call it another 500 million.
They do not -- I'm just repeating myself -- Yes. -- spend money on the Catholic school system.
Now, there's nothing immoral about that.
That's just the -- the -- what they do.
And -- and that's -- comes from the Constitution.
All right. If I decide -- it's the same question. If I decide for you, am I saying that they have to give money to the -- same amounts proportionate to -- to the parochial school? I think if they structure the benefit program the way they did here or the way they did in Trinity Lutheran -- No, no.
I'm saying the way -- If -- -- they do do it, not the way that they did it here and so forth. If they are giving out generally available public benefits for people to go to private schools -- Oh, oh, what's the private? Why is it that they have to be equal with private but they don't have to be equal with public? No, when you said charter schools, I took those to be private schools. Forget the charter schools.
Same -- same question. If -- if a city or state gives out funds for private education, which it's not required to do, it can limit its funding to public schools, but if it gives it out and it gives it out just for scholarships for private schools -- My hypothetical was they give it out in -- it's called the Public School System of the United States.
I'm saying that's what I'm talking about.
Now, what's your response? What's the difference between this case, you win, and the same with the public schools, they have to give it to parochial schools too.
What's the difference? Justice Breyer, what I'm saying in the last paragraph of Trinity Lutheran, when the Court said you can't deny a generally available public benefit to an entity that's otherwise qualified based solely on its religious character or nature -- So Mr. Wall, don't you -- -- that rule applies equally to schools as to playgrounds. Mr. Wall, I mean, there seems -- I was one of the seven in Trinity Lutheran, but there seems to me a real difference in this case.
In Trinity Lutheran, the -- a state was using the religious status of various people or entities to limit access to a unrelated public benefit, to a completely secular public benefit. Now, here, it seems to me, that what the state is doing with respect to these educational programs is to say: We don't want to subsidize religious activity.
We don't want to subsidize religious education.
And, further, because of the way that the supreme court issued its decision, that will mean that we don't want to subsidize any private education. So you have both the non-discrimination as to that, but even put that aside, what this is is essentially a state saying, for many reasons that have been viewed as legitimate, even though not shared by everybody, but have been viewed as legitimate for many years, we don't want to subsidize religious activity, in particular religious education.
That's a far cry from Trinity Lutheran. So your question gets at the two things I was hoping to say before I sat down. The -- the first is all we're asking and the Petitioners are asking is that you do what you normally do when you review a state supreme court decision.
At page 32 of the Pet. App., it said no problem with federal law.
It got federal law wrong.
If it had come out correctly on the federal law question, nothing else in the decision would have flowed.
The trial court would have been affirmed and everybody would have gotten the scholarships. That -- with the application of the state constitutional provision, which was preempted under Trinity Lutheran, was the only basis to impugn the state law.
So you should reverse the federal error and send it back. On the merits of your question, look, I get that you can say it's a harder case because it's -- it's education and it's not a playground.
And in that sense, it may be a harder question, but the Montana Supreme Court didn't take it as a case about use, didn't try to say this was covered by Davey or any of the rest. It said religiously-affiliated schools.
That's a status-based distinction. And I don't think we can distinguish that from Trinity Lutheran. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution does not bar the State of Montana from enacting and applying a state constitutional provision that keeps its own state legislature out of the business of funding of religious schools. The no-aid clause does not prohibit anyone's free exercise of religion.
To the contrary, it protects religious freedom by protecting religious schools from government influence and ensuring that government cannot use aid as leverage to influence the content of religious education. Petitioners attempt to analogize this case to Trinity Lutheran but the analogy is inapt for two reasons: The first reason is that the coercion aspect of Trinity Lutheran, which was crucial to the Court's decision, was absent here.
In Trinity Lutheran, the church put to a stark choice: Either abandon your religious faith and become a nice secular stone building with a daycare facility and you're going to get the money or stick to your religious faith and you won't get -- you won't get the money. And that coercion was the premise of the Court's decision that there is a penalty on free exercise.
That's not happening in this case where the state court held that Montana wasn't even capable of knowing whether a particular parent would use money for a religious and non-religious school, and it therefore held that regardless of how the money was spent, there wouldn't be a tax credit. The second distinction from Trinity Lutheran is that Trinity Lutheran involved the refusal to give money to a church for a completely non-religious purpose, merely because it was a church.
This case is different in that the state is simply declining to fund religious education. The state court did not hold that under the no-aid clause, religious schools would be denied funding for non-religious purposes. So let me start with the standing point which came up during the first half hour. So we didn't, as the Court knows, it's in an amicus brief, but we didn't make the argument in our brief because we concluded that the arguments really went more to the merits rather than standing. We -- I -- I mean, we believe there's an attenuated connection between the state action here and Petitioners' free exercise of religion but Petitioners are alleging in their brief that they personally are the victims of status discrimination because they are Christians. We think that's wrong based on what the state court actually did, but historically the courthouse doors have been open to make that kind of argument.
But we think on the merits, there simply isn't a prohibition on the free exercise. I -- I'd like to get back to Justice Breyer's question and get your view you on it which I understand it to be that why doesn't -- do you think the other side's theory leads to a situation where the funding that goes to public schools, a -- a -- if -- if they prevail, wouldn't have to go to religious schools? Well, I mean, I'm not sure of the breadth of their theory.
I mean, there's a number of amicus briefs that -- that make that exact point.
I mean -- Well, let's take it to be just that, I mean, this is a case about money and the question whether or not it must go to religious schools.
And I am wondering if the public -- the funding of public schools is the same as the situation involved here in your -- in your view? I guess I don't understand Petitioners to be making that argument in this particular case. They're not, but that's what's -- but it still can bother me. I'd like to know if in deciding it for them, if I do, that I have made a major change in the public school system. I understand one's private and the other's public.
And what I'm asking for, you or them, why would that matter? Well -- That is, why -- why would it make a difference, if you have to give -- I mean, now don't jump on to my argument and say, great, it supports you.
I'm not making an argument to support you. (Laughter.) I'm asking a question to find out the answer. Well, I -- I -- I'm not sure exactly how far Petitioners' argument would lead, but I -- I do think that one important point of this -- in this case is that states generally have had power over education, and to decide that they're only going to fund the public school system, and that is the ultimate effect of the state court's judgment in this case. But, I wonder if -- if there's a difference in the sense that -- that -- between general funding of the public schools and the decision to provide aid to private schools, except not religious schools. Well, so I think that, you know, the question in this case ultimately boils down to, whether the striking down of the program because of the no-aid clause just in and of itself is a violation of the free exercise right of Petitioners. And, you know, the first half of the argument involved a number of questions about how Petitioners are really harmed if the program as a whole is struck down. And I think I heard two sets of arguments from the other side, from Petitioners, both of which I would like to address.
One argument is the sort of broader argument that just, the no-aid clause is just constitutionally defective, like, by its very nature, because it is discriminatory, is not capable of being applied, and, therefore, the court should just remand and tell the court you just can't apply this illegal rule. And the second argument I heard is this somewhat narrower argument that as applied, the problem here is that the court excluded religious schools from a general program as in Trinity Lutheran. So if I could just address those -- those two theories of the case by Petitioners. So I think the first argument really is tantamount to an argument that the no-aid clause is facially unconstitutional, because like every single time you applied the no-aid clause, the rule it recites is that religious schools don't get money because -- Well, I thought they were quite clear, that they were not arguing -- they were not making a facial challenge. Right. It was a challenge as applied to the particular situation here. Right.
So if -- if that's the case, and I -- I agree that that's the tenor of Petitioners' argument.
I think the government was making a broader argument but I think Petitioners' argument is more limited. So if -- if it is the case that in general the Court -- the state court can apply the no-aid clause, in other words, it's not just facially discriminatory to say because something is religious -- Well, they're not -- -- we're not -- -- conceding that. They're just saying you have to consider it as applied here.
Look, I -- I -- I like your reaction to this way of looking at the case. Maybe it's right; maybe it's wrong.
A -- it is a violation of the Federal Constitution if a state Supreme Court bases a decision on a ground that discriminates in violation of the constitution. Do you agree with that? I would agree with that, but obviously the question is whether it discriminates in violation of the Constitution -- Okay. -- the last part of that.
Look -- All right. -- I'm not -- I'm not objecting -- The argument is if they -- they don't have to fund private education at all, but if they choose to provide scholarships that are available to students who attend private schools, they can't discriminate against parents who want to send their children to schools that are affiliated in some way with a church. So I -- That's the simple argument.
And it's hard to see that that's much different from Trinity Lutheran. No, I think it is completely different from Trinity Lutheran.
So look, I'm not going to object to the general premise that Your Honor offered, that if there's like a -- a -- a legal rule, just the very application of the rule is constitutionally defective, then you can reverse the state court decision.
I'm -- I'm not going to fight that proposition as a general matter.
But that's not the question here. I think the question here is whether the state may apply a no-aid clause.
And I think that the answer is yes.
Because if you accept the premise that the -- Counsel, wouldn't you -- Yes. In terms of what you're agreeing with Justice Alito, I just want to press you a little bit further.
Let's say a state court decision could be consistent with the constitution or not consistent with the constitution, right? The outcome may or may not be. If the -- if -- if the decision rests on an erroneous interpretation of federal law and remedying that error could provide relief, we have a case, don't we? I mean, in principle, if we assume there's an error of federal law in -- Yes. -- the court's decision -- Assuming there's an error of federal -- in federal law and that remedying it here might provide relief to plaintiffs, we have a case. I -- I -- so, I think that, yes, as a general matter, at a high level of generality, if Petitioners identify an error of federal law in a lower court decision, I think the Court can adjudicate the error federally. Okay.
So the question really becomes do we have an error of federal law here? Right.
But the question is what becomes an error of federal law. Suppose -- suppose the state said we're going to allow the scholarship funds to be used for secular schools or Protestant schools but not for Jewish schools or Catholic schools.
Unconstitutional? Yes, so I think that -- Is that a yes? Yes. Okay.
So what's different when you say the scholarship funds can be used for secular schools but not for Protestant, Jewish, Catholic or other religious schools because of the religious status? So, I think the right lens to look at that hypothetical is the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the state -- regardless of whether there's an infringement on any individual liberty, I think the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from distinguishing between one religion versus a different religion.
And I think that's an example -- But a lot of the free-exercise equal-treatment cases, going back to Everson, McDaniel, say you can't exclude religious people, religious institutions, religious speech because it's religious from a generally applicable program -- Right.
So -- -- the fact that it's odious to the Constitution to quote the words of Trinity Lutheran. So why isn't this excluding religious people, telling them that they're not entitled to equal treatment under the Constitution, why isn't that a violation of -- a straight violation of the Trinity Lutheran principle which goes back to Everson -- Because I think -- And why is it different from other hypothetical? I think the state has a choice, right? It's not allowed to tell people we are going to penalize you for exercising your religion.
That's a prohibition. I think that the core insight of a case like Trinity Lutheran is that there's no difference between the denial of a benefit and a fine.
That's a prohibition because you're actually penalizing the decision to exercise religion. That doesn't mean that the state has to fund religious schools and it also doesn't mean the state can't just apply a principled view that it doesn't want -- But if you're a -- -- to get involved in religious education. If you're running a scholarship fund and there's a group of people lining up for the scholarships, are you secular? Okay, you can get it? Are you Catholic? No, you're out because you're Catholic. Yeah, that's exactly what the state -- How is that -- -- court is not doing in this case. How is that -- how is that consistent with the principle set forth in Trinity Lutheran or McDaniel, Justice Brennan's concurrence in McDaniel? I think that's exactly what the state court ensured wouldn't happen. It's not just a matter of like -- The predicate -- the predicate was that that kind of discrimination is -- does not violate the Federal Constitution. No, I -- I -- I think that the state court can say, look, as a state, we have a no-aid clause clause.
We have a principled objection to funding of religious institutions, but we understand that this sort of classification of coercing people on to being secular is a penalty on religion.
So to balance those two interests, we're going to simply level down. And I just want to be clear, we're not defending religious bigotry here, okay? I think no-aid clauses have a principal justification, especially in Montana. Well, they're -- they're certainly rooted in -- in grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics.
You agree with that? I mean, I think that in the 1880s, there was undoubtedly grotesque religious bigotry against -- against Catholics. I don't think that's -- That was the -- -- comes out in the -- -- clear motivation for this. No, not -- that's not true.
In the 1972 Constitution, which is where this provision was enacted, I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever of any anti-religious bigotry.
I think the -- yes, Your Honor? I'm sorry. No, I -- I want to -- to see if there's any real difference between this and Trinity Lutheran.
So what the -- excuse me -- what Article X, Section 6 of the Montana Constitution says that there can't be any aid, indirect or direct, to any institution, school, or other institution controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination. So if you have a school that has a board of trustees and one or more of the board -- members of the board of trustees ex officio are members of a religious body, that would seem to provide control, in part.
Would that be sufficient under the Montana Constitution, without looking at all at the nature of the education provided by the school? No, I don't think so. That's not how the state court has construed the Constitution -- Where has it said -- where has it said that that's not how it's construed? That's control in -- in part. So if you read the lower court opinion, there's all this language about how the real problem here is that the money is going to the school, which is going to spend it on religious education.
The language -- Well, they're talking about schools in general.
How do they know what schools they're talking about? No, they're -- they're saying -- they're not talking about schools in general.
There's all this language saying that money is going to go to a school and, therefore, the money -- the school is going to spend that money on explicitly religious education. If I could just step back, look, I'm agreeing -- I agree that the -- the lower court opinion is not completely clear on this.
I mean, part of the problem is I think that this -- this challenge has really changed in this Court.
In the lower court, it wasn't the no-aid clause that was really being challenged; it was the rule. And so I don't think -- I mean, I think the state courts in general should be entitled to adopt limiting constructions of their own state constitutions.
I just don't think the state court had the chance to do that here because the argument wasn't really raised. And I think it would be a little unfair in this Court to sort of assume the broadest possible interpretation of the state constitution just for purposes of -- of like invalidating it.
At minimum -- May I ask you a question? Let's go back to the basic, okay? Let's take the proposition here that the law as written giving aid discriminated.
I know you're challenge that, okay? But that it violates the U.S. Constitution -- Yes. -- because -- Rule 1 does because it permits secular schools but not religious schools from receiving the scholarship.
I know you take as a defense position that they can do that.
Putting that aside, you're wrong.
Assume that.
Okay? I accept I'm wrong, yes. All right.
Now, there was a suggestion in an earlier question that if you were wrong, and the Montana Supreme Court in turn uses the Montana Constitution to level down, that it is unconstitutionally acting, that it is using religion to level down. How do you answer that argument? Because -- Because that's exactly what we were told in a question, which is they are basing the leveling down on the basis of discriminating against religion. So I think that the answering of that question requires a kind of focused analysis of exactly what the Constitution allows and doesn't allow, all right? So if you accept the premise that Rule 1 is unconstitutional because it discriminates, it says secular schools in and religious schools out, that doesn't answer the question of whether the mere application of a no-aid clause that does not lead to a judgment with that effect is also unconstitutional. So I think the crucial point in this case is to look at what the state court did when it applied the no-aid clause. No, isn't the crucial question why the state court did what it did? If it did what it did for an unconstitutionally discriminatory reason, then there's a problem under Village of Arlington Heights. So I'll give you an example.
The state legislature sets up a scholarship fund, and after a while, people look at the -- the recipients of the scholarships, and some people say: Wow, these are mostly going to blacks and we don't like that and that's contrary to state law.
So the state supreme court says: Okay, that discrimination is -- we're going to strike down the whole thing. Is that constitutional? No, so we don't think the race analogy is apt.
I don't think that's constitutional, and we just don't think that race and religion are identical for all constitutional -- What they're -- what he's saying is that, look, the Court took the case in the Prince -- Prince Edward County thing -- Yes. -- or the equivalent and said they couldn't do that.
They can't shut down all the schools, even though the Constitution they didn't say had a right and so that's the similarity. So I -- I assume the -- I think, Justice -- I have an answer -- But I have -- I'd like you to think about that -- Look -- -- but I have a more direct question on the merits.
Sorry. Look, the state says Catholic schools get some money; Jewish schools don't. Yeah. All right? No problem, unconstitutional, free exercise, right? And establishment, yes. Okay.
The -- the state says: We'll give police protection to all schools, all people, but no religious institution.
That's -- That -- that -- -- unconstitutional. That's Trinity Lutheran. Clearly.
Okay. Yeah.
Correct. Yeah. Now, why is it different? And I'm not saying it isn't.
I want to know your reason why is it different? Oh, try it the opposite extreme. The state says: We will pay for the salaries of priests if they're Mohammedan but not if they're Buddhist.
Unconstitutional, right? Yeah. Okay.
So why doesn't it also violate the Constitution were the state to say we won't pay the salaries of any priests but we will pay the head of every other organization? Well, I think that -- I mean, you see where I'm -- you see -- Yes. -- how I'm doing that? You see the point? So let me -- let me answer that question and then go back to the race question I would like to address. Okay.
You don't have to answer if you don't want to. (Laughter.) Well, I'll -- I'll give a -- I recommend it, though. (Laughter.) I'll give a brief answer. Yeah. So I think that there's a constitutional difference between distinguishing among religions and saying the Court is -- the government is just going to stay out of religion altogether. That's correct. There's many Establishment Clause cases saying that regardless of whether there's a civil liberties violation, it's just contrary to -- to disestablishment principles to say that we're going to treat one religion -- Okay, I got that. -- totally different from another one. So what about the other part, where we said, look, you can't discriminate against all religions by not giving them playgrounds or you can't discriminate against all religions by refusing to give them police protection or fire protection? What about that part? All right.
So there -- there's two differences between that case and this one.
One is the striking down of the whole program, which we've talked about throughout the argument today, and then there's a second point which hasn't really come up, which is sort of the Locke v. Davey distinction between a declination to fund religious education and refusing funding merely because someone happens to be religious for a completely non-religious purpose. Does -- And I think that -- Does -- Can I take you back, Mr. Unikowsky, to the striking down the whole program? Yes. Because a number of people have suggested that that must be motivated by animus towards religion. Right. And I can think of many reasons why you would strike down the whole program that have nothing to do with animus toward religion.
You might actually think that funding religion imposes costs and burdens on religious institutions themselves.
You might think that taxpayers have conscientious objections to funding religion.
You might think that funding religion creates divisiveness and conflict within a society, and that for all those reasons, funding religious activity is not a good idea and that you would rather level down and fund no comparable activity, whether religious or otherwise, than fund both. Now, none of those things have anything to do with animus towards religion, and I -- I -- I -- So I think that's right, and I think that's why we don't think the race analogy is apt.
And I think it's useful to talk about why the no-aid clause was enacted based on the convention's discussions in 1972 and why it makes sense that those justifications would result in -- Why -- why does that explain why the race analogy is inapt? I mean, the legislature may say they built parks and pools, and they say funding those, but if a higher percentage of African Americans come and use the pools, then we're going to shut down the whole program. And you wouldn't defend that on saying they could have a judgment that it decreases tensions among the different races to keep them -- no, you would just look at the facial discrimination, right, and conclude the fact that -- that wouldn't be good under your view, would it? Of course not -- Because they're shutting down the whole -- No. -- program? No.
Of course not. How is that different than religion, which is also protected under -- under the First Amendment? Because I don't think that race and religion are identical for all constitutional purposes, right? Look -- look, if a state constitution had a provision saying that like historically black colleges aren't entitled to any aid at all, that would obviously be facially unconstitutional.
You wouldn't even need to get to these as-applied challenges at all because I think the equal-protection clause embodies a judgment that race is never, ever a permissible criterion in any government decision making at all, regardless -- unless strict scrutiny is satisfied, which is very, very difficult. And -- and I don't think the rule is the same in religion.
But later this term, this Court's about to hear a case involving exemptions of religious schools from anti- discrimination laws.
That distinguishes between -- that -- that creates a sort of religious classification but that does -- that's not intrinsically unconstitutional. Was that -- was that your answer to Justice Kagan's question? No, so -- well -- Well, I -- go ahead.
I'd like to give you the chance to do that. The answer is, I think if you accept that no-aid clauses are not facially unconstitutional, and I think it's a hard argument to make for all the historical reasons, they've existed for such a long time, then you have to accept that it's at least permissible for a state to say, for principled reasons deeply rooted in national tradition dating back to Madison, we have a preference to not fund religious activities, not prohibit it but not fund it. But there's a difference between saying we're not going to fund religious activities and saying we're going to discriminate based on religion.
That's the point.
They -- the state -- nobody's claiming the state has an obligation to make particular grants to religious institutions or to provide any funding for private education at all. The question is, can they -- if -- if -- if there is a program that is -- that's -- is designed to serve certain purposes, can they discriminate in the application of the -- in the -- in the -- deciding who's going to get the benefit of it on the basis of religious affiliation? I think what -- so that sounds more like the Trinity Lutheran hypothetical.
I think what state -- there are certain things a state can't do and certain things a state can do. What I think a state can do is say, look, we have a no-aid clause which has existed for a very long time and that says on its face that we prefer not to fund religious activities for good reasons I'd like to explain in just a second, okay? Now, we're constrained by anti-discrimination principles from coercing people into abandoning their religion.
So if we have these two principles, these principled non-bigoted and historically rooted views that we don't want to fund religious activity on the one hand, and the First Amendment, which clearly guards against coercion and penalizing religious faith on the other, the way we're going to balance it is to do what the state court did. And I just want to say one thing about that. To do what the state court did, meaning? Yes, invalidate the program.
And I just -- I mean, if you look at the reasons the no-aid clause was enacted which I think are similar to the reasons James Madison gave, it's just hard to say that James Madison disabled future states from enacting no-aid clauses based on essentially similar arguments to the ones he made. And in 1972, what the delegates basically said was that they conceived of the no-aid clause as a mechanism of protecting religious schools from political influence.
So, to prevent government from using its leverage to -- to influence the content of religious education. There's like a lot of leaders of religious denominations who came forward and testified in favor of the no-aid clause for that exact reason.
And I think it's very clear why that justification applies with complete force with respect to this program, right? Because it's -- Basically what you're saying is, the difference between this and race is, it's permissible to discriminate on the basis of religion.
It's not permissible, ever, to discriminate on the basis of -- of race. That's what you're saying. I mean, look, it -- it seems to me that when you talk about discrimination, we can mean two different things, all right? One way of looking at discrimination is to say that just -- you can't have a rule that treats religion differently from other subjects, which is I think is the core of Petitioners' argument. And they say, look at the no-aid clause.
It says religious schools are ineligible and it imposes no comparable restriction on anyone else, and therefore that's just discrimination and it should be wiped out of the state constitution. So if -- if -- if you buy that argument, then you're basically saying that like every no-aid clause since 1835 is unconstitutional, even at the founding.
Look, all the state constitutions said things like, a tax won't be levied to build a church.
That is a form of discrimination, right? Like you can levy a tax to build a bridge but not a church. Well, I -- I mean, I don't know about every -- every no-aid clause in the country.
They'd all have to be examined separately if in -- if, in fact, they are challenged. A lot of them -- look, you -- I'm not going to get into an argument with you about what happened in 1972, but do you really want to argue that the reason why a lot of this popped up beginning, coincidentally, in the 1840s, at the time of the Irish potato famine, that had nothing to do with discrimination based on religion? I'm not saying that they -- no, I'm not saying that at all.
I think that the history in the 19th century is very complex, like there's a Professor Green, who is a leading scholar on this, wrote a book that both parties cite which basically says it's a complex history and there's good reasons and there's bad reasons and it depends on the state. And, look, I -- I don't see how Montana could -- But aren't you saying -- are you -- I don't know, can we -- can you or could I say this: Yes, race is different from religion.
Why? There is no Establishment Clause in regard to race. What is the Establishment Clause? Well, it has something to do with not supporting religion.
And there is nothing more religious except perhaps for the service in the church itself than religious education.
That's how we create a future for our religion. Now, there's some line there, and that line may be what I have just suggested, impermissible under case law of this Court or it may be permissible but unwise.
You'd like to draw the line.
Explain it. Okay.
So I think that, you know, we haven't talked about the analogies to Locke at all.
I'd just like to say a few words about that, with I -- which I think are consistent to your question. So it's true that there are factual distinctions between this case and Locke, right? Locke involved training for the ministry and this case involves secondary education. So I'm -- I'm not denying -- I'm not saying they're on all fours with each other, but the question is whether that distinction can be located in the free-exercise clause. Because, really, you know, it's true that Locke involved funding of the ministry but I think this case does too, right, the ministry of teachers towards their students.
And I think Petitioners have a somewhat revealing statement -- But this is a -- this is a school, in education, there satisfies the compulsory education laws of the state, correct? That's true. And so that's different from Locke, as Professor Laycock's amicus brief points out in a very narrow decision about training of the clergy. And it seems to me there are two different things going on here, it seems to me. One is to Justice Breyer's question, just funding religion, funding religious schools generally or training of clergy is -- is an establishment clause concern, but this -- it's a separate issue when you set up a neutral benefit program -- police, fire, or scholarships -- and allow people to use those things, allow religious institutions to obtain the benefits of those things on a non-discriminatory basis. And the question in this case, it seems to me, is which side of that line this comes on.
Is that the -- a proper way to look at it? And if so, why does it come on the funding side? I -- I guess I'm not really sure that's the right way to look at it. I think that it's important to just look at the interest the no-aid clause protects, understand whether those are just unconstitutional and whether they apply to this case. So as I said, the no-aid clause was concerned about using government leverage to influence religious education.
And it's very easy how -- to see how that can happen in the context of even a neutral program like this one. The state can just have a condition -- You think that was the design of the no-aid clause, to -- to help religious institutions? Yeah.
If you look at the transcripts of 1972, that's -- is -- what it's all about.
There -- there is numerous religious leaders who came forward and testified that that's the reason they wanted it.
On the floor of the convention in 1972, the strongest proponent was Delegate Harper who was not an anti-religious bigot.
He was the pastor of a church in Helena and he told his colleagues, drawing on his own religious faith, that the no-aid clause was necessary to ensure that religious schools were independent from government. So I just don't -- and there's a committee report -- Well, no one's compelling the religious schools to participate in a program in order to accept funds from the program, correct? That is certainly true.
But -- So a religious school that doesn't want to be part of a neutral program doesn't have to be. Yeah, that's true. But I mean, there's still a concern that ultimately the inevitable effect of these programs is that the government would exercise its leverage over schools. And, look, this is what people were saying at the hearing, and I think that may be a little paternalistic, but I think the state is allowed to have a structural provision being arguably paternalistic in its own state constitution. There's no bigotry whatsoever in evidence from the actual convention at which this is enacted.
I just don't understand how Montana could have done any better than it did, to wipe out its entire state constitution, start all over again, have committee hearings -- I think the other side's argument is the way you can do better is to say: If we're going to give benefits to private schools, which you don't have to do -- to Justice Breyer's question, you do not have to give benefits to private schools or funds or tax credits, but if you do, don't tell someone they can't participate because they're Jewish or Protestant or Catholic. I guess the -- the concern of the delegates was that if you have money going to religious schools, that's going to lead to entanglement problems.
And the way to solve that problem is to have a structural provision saying, we're not going to do it. And that's not prohibiting anyone from exercising their religion.
It's simply separating the church from the state without, again, preventing anyone from going to any of these schools if they don't want to. And it's true that there's a constraint in the Federal Constitution that says that you can't coerce people, you can't tell people we're going to penalize you for being religious.
But if a state has two principles it wants to stick to at the same time then we think that it should be able to balance those principles by invalidating the program. Mr. Unikowsky, if we can just go back to the standing question. You are not at liberty to waive Article III, so why do you think this case doesn't fit under Eastern Kentucky? So I'll -- I'll just answer briefly, Your Honor. Sure. So Petitioners are claiming they personally are the victims of status discrimination, which is the argument that wasn't made in that case.
So we think that they're allowed to make that argument, it is just incorrect on its merits. But, of course, this argument is made in amicus brief.
And, as you say, we're not able to waive it. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Komer, two minutes remaining. Thank you. What we're saying here is that -- what Trinity Lutheran says, the state can't discriminate on the basis of religion.
The decision is crystal clear when you read it that that is what they are doing in this case. They focus on the religious affiliation or religious nature of the schools. They are not talking about what the schools do. They are talking about what the schools are. Second, Zelman has already answered the question about who this program is aiding. It's not aiding the schools.
It is aiding the parents. You have a choice to make about the parents here.
You can either view them as mere inconsequential conduits through which public funds flow to the religious schools they choose or you can regard them, as you did in Zelman, as free and independent decision-makers who are being given the power to choose a religious education or a secular education in private schools. We are not arguing that the state couldn't just fund public schools.
We are saying that when the legislature, when the state makes the decision to empower parents to exercise their right to choose and direct their children's education, that the state cannot distinguish between parents who want a religious education for their children and parents who want a secular private education for their parents. We are only in that area because the state legislature has made, like Montana did, the decision to open it up beyond the public schools.
We don't question that the public schools must be secular.
This Court recognized that in Schempp.
And, as a result, the public schools now must be secular. But at the time these provisions were passed, the public schools were not secular. It's almost -- That is why -- It's almost sort of a illusory state, isn't it? The legislatures can choose to give money or not.
If they choose, they have to do it this way. But the court system is out of it because it can't force the legislatures to act constitutionally under their own constitution. You may -- That's basically what you're saying, isn't it? You may answer briefly. And not fund. We're saying the legislature ab initio might be able to do more than what the court should have done here.
They should have answered the federal question.
They should have recognized that Trinity Lutheran is applicable.
They should have recognized they were applying Locke exactly the way Missouri tried to. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument today in Case 18-1334, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Aurelius Investment, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether members of the Financial Oversight Board are officers of the United States who must be selected in the manner that the Appointments Clause prescribes or whether they are instead territorial officers who do not have to be selected in that manner. The Constitution's text, structure, and history, and this Court's precedents all make clear that the proper focus in answering that question is the nature of the authority the Board exercises.
It comes down to whether Congress has vested the Board with the executive power of the national government or, instead, vested the Board with the territorial executive power. The statute that created the Board, PROMESA, answers that question in a straightforward way.
It -- it sets up an entity within the territorial government.
It gives the Board only territory-specific authority and instructs the Board to pursue only territory-specific objectives. The Board acts on behalf of Puerto Rico as its representative in judicial proceedings to restructure the territory's debts.
It pursues only Puerto Rico's interests in those proceedings.
It's up to the Article III court that adjudicates those proceedings to balance all the competing interests. Congress also instructed the Board to implement a method for restoring fiscal stability.
That, too, is territorial authority. It reaches only Puerto Rico's budgeting and fiscal planning, and the Board must exercise that authority in a manner that protects Puerto Rico's vital -- vital interests. Now Congress did build in protections to guarantee the Board's independence.
Congress did that because it concluded that Puerto Rico's staggering financial and humanitarian crisis could not be solved unless the Board was insulated from the political pressures that caused that crisis in the first place. But Congress also insulated the Board from federal control.
Board members can be removed only for cause, which means that the President cannot remove them based on disagreement with the Board's policies or priorities in implementing PROMESA. When you put all that together, it's -- the Board is in the territorial government, it's been given statutory directives to advance the interests of Puerto Rico, and it's insulated from federal control, it's clear that Board members are territorial officials -- So how -- -- not officers of the United States. Mister -- -- how can that be, Mr. Verrilli? It seems to me that your very argument that it's independent is suggesting it can't belong to the territory and that there's a serious problem that the federal government is creating an entity that no one can control. Neither Congress nor the President can remove this entity for anything but cause. Tell me how this differs from a U.S. attorney.
A U.S. attorney is an officer of the United States.
I think you accept that.
A U.S. attorney is enforcing federal law in Puerto Rico, the U.S. attorney of Puerto Rico, just the way PROMESA is.
And a U.S. attorney doesn't have jurisdiction outside of Puerto Rico. So how is the U.S. attorney different? So let me make a general point, and then I'll specifically answer the U.S. attorney question. The general point, I think it's important to make clear, we don't say, contrary to our friends on the other side, that the Appointments Clause doesn't apply in Puerto Rico.
It applies in Puerto Rico just like it applies in a state, in that federal officials, officials who are part of the federal government, have to be appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause -- Could you do this -- could you pass -- -- including the U.S. attorney and -- -- could you pass -- could Congress pass a law that -- like PROMESA for a state? No, I don't think so, because the difference between that situation and this situation is Article IV.
And I really think that gets to the heart of the matter, Justice Sotomayor, that I think the beef that my friends on the other side have is not with the Appointments Clause; it's with Article IV. And the difference between this situation and a state is that Congress has reserved authority under Article IV to alter the structure of a territorial government and to prescribe territorial law -- Could you -- -- its substantive territorial law. -- could you give at least a quick answer -- Sure.
I'd be -- -- to the first part of Justice Sotomayor's question? Yes.
Of course.
The difference, I think, the key difference between a U.S. attorney and the Board is that the U.S. attorney is executing laws of nationwide application, the -- the U.S. Criminal Code, Title 18.
And the U.S. attorney in Puerto Rico in that respect is no different than the U.S. attorney in New York. The Board does not implement laws of nationwide application.
It implements as law -- But all laws don't have nationwide application, even federal laws. Some federal laws have local application as opposed to national.
They're still federal law because they were passed by Congress and there federal dictates. But -- This is no different for the U.S. attorney. I do think it's different in a fundamental way, Your Honor.
It is territory-specific.
It applies only to the territory of Puerto Rico.
And the Board's authority is to -- is to act in the interests of the territory of Puerto Rico in the -- in their -- Well, Mr. Verrilli, I mean, suppose that Congress looks at Florida and it says that there are a lot of hurricanes there and the waters are rising, and we have a terrible Florida problem.
And Congress passes the Florida Reclamation Act, and it's supposed to deal with, you know, the Florida problem that it perceives but uses federal law to do so. Would you say that -- I think the -- your -- your phrase was the executive power of the national government.
Would the head of the agency that the Florida Reclamation Act sets up be exercising the executive power of the national government? Yes.
And the difference is -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. No, I was just going to say, what is the difference, Mr. Verrilli? (Laughter.) And the difference -- and the difference is -- and the difference is that -- that Congress has dual authority with respect to the territories to act under Article I with nation -- laws of nationwide application, which are enforced by federal officials.
For example, there's a FEMA regional administrator. There's an EPA regional administrator.
They're all appointed in conformity with the requirements of the Appointments Clause.
But it has dual authority.
It can also act as a territorial legislature, and -- and under Article IV, it has plenary authority to do so. Well, how do we know which -- which authority it's using? Well, you look -- I -- I think as -- we think Palmore is the relevant precedent there.
And I think what you do is you look to two things.
First, what does it -- what does Congress say it's doing.
Here, Congress said expressly we're invoking Article IV and we're creating an entity in the territorial government.
That's the -- What -- what's -- -- language of the statute, entity -- -- what's the argument, Mr. Verrilli -- you started with this is an -- this is an entity within the Puerto Rico government.
The argument on the other side is no, it's not within; it's above.
It's above the Puerto Rican government, and it's -- it's above the legislature and the governor. Yes, and that's -- and that's simply an incorrect characterization.
I think it misinterprets independence for superintendence.
And I think, if you think about it, it's just not right to say that what you've got here is a federal overlord or a federal master in the language of -- of the First Circuit, because think about what Congress did here. First, it said that the -- that the Board's authority is territory-specific, and then it said that the Board is supposed to act on behalf of Puerto Rico and represent Puerto Rico in the restructuring proceedings.
It's not supposed to advance the broad interests of the United States.
It advances Puerto Rico's interests. And, similarly, with respect to its budget -- Well, wasn't Congress thinking about the broad interests of the United States? I mean, here it was.
It was looking at this terrible financial crisis in Puerto Rico and considering a wide variety of options to address that crisis. Now one option could have been some kind of financial bailout.
Congress didn't want to do that.
It instead chose an option that had less financial cost for the American people as a whole. So, you know, why shouldn't we think that Congress, in enacting this piece of legislation, was not thinking about it through a broad national lens? First, I think what matters is what Congress did, not what the motivations of individual legislatures were in moving forward with what Congress did. Second, the best evidence of what Congress did is the statute itself, where it made a choice to create an entity in Puerto Rico and it instructed it to act on behalf of Puerto Rico.
And even with respect to its budgeting authority, it said when you do your budgeting and fiscal planning, you've got to ensure that there's adequate funding for essential services in Puerto Rico, adequate funding for the Puerto Rico pension plan, adequate funding for economic development in Puerto Rico. It told this Board to act for Puerto Rico. Counsel, what if we don't think it's an all or nothing division when you look at the responsibilities of the Board? I mean, certainly much of it has to do with territorial issues, but you can certainly appreciate congressmen viewing this obviously as something with nationwide significance. So, to some extent, it's dealing with territorial issues.
To some extent, it's dealing with issues of broader national significance. What happens to your case in that instance? I think it's -- I think the answer is the same, because what matters is the power that Congress chose to invoke and the way in which Congress chose to act. And what Congress did here was tell the Board the way to address this problem is by acting in the interests of Puerto Rico.
And then it also insulated the Board from federal control through the for cause standard. May I ask you, if we had the original act setting up the U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico and Congress changed only one label of the three Palmore factors, same factual situation as exists now, except that it says we're doing it under the territorial clause. You're suggesting that that's enough reason for why -- Absolutely -- -- our -- -- absolutely not, Your Honor.
And that's why the third factor in Palmore is the critical one.
You have to look at the nature of the authority that the office is executing. All right. And they -- Now let me ask you how you can label this a territorial officer as opposed to a federal officer handling federal issues -- a federal mandate when none of the people of Puerto Rico have voted in any way to -- on any of the directives that this agent has received? I -- I understand that point, Your Honor.
But, again, I don't think that has anything to do with the Appointments Clause. There is no doubt under this Court's precedence, starting two centuries ago, and as recently as Sanchez Valle, that the Congress has reserved authority to act at the territorial level and to change the structure of -- Certainly. There's no question. -- territorial government and to change the substance. There's no fight -- there's no fight there.
The issue is where do you draw a line between what's a federal officer and what's a territorial officer. And I think -- And the issue has to be that when Congress chooses, it's Congress's choice. If the territory chooses, if it elects a governor, if it elects legislature, if it elects its own Attorney General, that those are officers that Puerto Rico have selected. But, if the federal government is making the selection and imposing it on a territory, it has to be a federal officer. I -- that's -- I -- I -- that I think that's just not right on numerous levels, Your Honor, and -- and -- No, it's too simplistic for you. (Laughter.) No, no, no, no.
The main -- I -- I -- that's -- that's the problem that everybody -- -- one of the main reasons which it's not right, I think, is that it's not consistent with the history of this country. And if you start with the mayor of Washington in 1802 -- now, admittedly, it's the Enclave Clause, not the Territories Clause, but the Court has said that there are provisions that should be read in the same way -- if -- if you start with that, the mayor of Washington was appointed -- was -- Congress created the position of mayor of Washington under a statute. That -- that's one -- I mean, that's one example.
But the other side says the historical practice is otherwise overwhelming in -- up until about the 1950s, of saying that territorial officers had to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. So how do we deal with that historical practice? You do have the mayor example, so it's not uniform.
But how do we deal with that historical practice? Two points.
First on the mayor.
I think the mayor of Washington is an extremely significant historical marker because, after all, the Presidents who made those appointments every year during that period were Jefferson and Madison, and if they had thought that their -- that the Appointments Clause applied in a situation like that -- I -- I -- -- certainly, we would have heard about that. -- I agree with you -- I agree with you -- And now with -- -- it's important, but assume the history is still -- But -- but with respect -- the history they have essentially is that territorial governors up until the 1950s were appointed with advice and consent.
But -- And judges. And territorial judges. But I actually think that -- let's go right to the judges point because I think that actually proves our position and not theirs, because even though territorial judges were always nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, this Court held starting in Cantor and then also in Englebrecht and McAllister that they weren't judicial officers of the United States, despite the fact that the President nominated them and the Senate confirmed them. And then, to reinforce that, there have been three times in the country's history where a question arose about whether a territorial judge could be impeached by Congress. And in each of those three instances, the political branches concluded that a territorial judge could not be impeached because a territorial judge was not a civil officer of the United States but only an officer of the territory exercising territorial power. Now, with respect to the governors, of course, you know, the -- the Appointments Clause is not an either/or proposition.
If it applies to the governors as principal officers, it applies to the people the governor appoints as inferior officers. But starting with the Northwest Ordinance and continuing throughout the country's history, inferior officers have been appointed in manners that don't comply with the Appointments Clause. Does it just -- does it strike you as a little strange, Mr. Verrilli, to use the history in this kind of case so extensively? I mean, first, it's a little bit all over the map and you each have your historical examples to point to. But, second, the position of territories currently is so different from the position of territories throughout much or most of our history. So I -- I guess it seems to me more natural, rather than to look to, you know, what the Northwest Ordinance did, is -- is simply to use a kind of functional test and say are these people doing the sorts of things that would be done by state officials in states, or are they doing the sorts of things that would be done by federal officials? So two things.
First, respectfully, we think, in interpreting the meaning of the phrase ""officer of the United States,"" which is the job that has to be done in this case, the history is very, very relevant. But, second, even if one takes a functional analysis, I think the right way to look at the functional analysis is to look at the -- what the Board is actually charged with doing. And what the Board is actually charged with doing is acting in the shoes of the government of Puerto Rico in the restructuring proceedings and acting as an independent entity insulated from political pressure within the budgeting proceedings, but -- but constrained by statute to act on behalf of, in the interests of, for the territory.
So -- Well -- -- if you're going to use a functional approach, they're very much like a state government, not a federal overlord. And I think this would actually be kind of a crazy system if what you wanted to do was create a federal overlord to say: You're a federal overlord.
Take the national interests into account, but, when you actually administer the -- the authority you have, you have to only focus -- What do we do about the brief -- -- on territorial interests. -- what do we do about the brief of at least there's one amicus that suggests that in one of the litigations that's ongoing, with respect to PROMESA, that there's all sorts of evidence that the Board is taking directives from federal officials? So I -- you know, that brief, you know, respectfully, Your Honor, I -- I think that shows the perils of relying on an amicus brief that relies on extra-record information. The vast majority of those -- of the -- the documents there have not been disclosed. But, if I may talk about them, because I've been asked about them, the -- the -- the vast majority of those are communications from federal government officials to the Board in the wake of the disasters and the hurricanes saying we need information about what's going on on the ground here. And so it was -- it was informational, the overwhelming majority of them.
Now they did find one communication from a Senate staffer, I think, or a House staffer, I think a Senate staffer, saying we want you to resolve Issue X this way.
Again, I've got to be outside the record to -- to answer that.
But, basically, the Board told them to pound sand.
And so I don't think there's any merit to it whatsoever. Thank you, counsel. General Wall. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We know that Congress expressly invoked its authority over the territories and placed the Board within the Puerto Rican government.
So the real question here is, was that choice constitutional under Article IV? It was. The Board budgets and restructures debt only for Puerto Rico.
It acts in the territory under a territory-specific statute. In our view, Mr. Chief Justice, the Board's focus is exclusively local, but, at a minimum, it's primarily local, which is the appropriate test under Palmore. Justice Kagan, Congress could have legislated directly.
It could have put this in the Treasury Department.
If it hadn't otherwise specified, the powers would have gone to the assembly and the governor with respect to restructuring the debt and representing the Commonwealth in these Title III proceedings. It didn't want that.
It wanted new and independent territorial officers on the ground in Puerto Rico to resolve the fiscal crisis as it had with the D.C. Control Board 20 years earlier.
That's a re -- And what was the position the government took, the D.C. Control Board? So they point to a D.C. Circuit brief in the second set of proceedings. We said in that brief, after this Court had held it's exercising federal power with respect to federal property, we said, sure, it's federal, but I -- I'd urge the Court to look at the brief. We said if it had been acting with respect to D.C., it would have been different because that would have been local power.
I think the same is true with respect to the territories.
We drew a distinction in that very brief between federal power over federal property and local power with respect to the District or, here, the territories. So I think our position has been entirely consistent.
As early as 18 -- I don't see how. I mean, you say federal power over federal property.
But that's what the Territory Clause, read your way, would say, that Puerto Rico is federal property.
You can't have it both ways. So I -- Your -- you have to be disposing of federal control over federal property, because that's what a territory is. So I -- I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor, but I don't know that much turns on that here.
Article IV says both property and the territory.
And this Court's cases have treated them differently.
So there it was Dulles and Reagan National airports. Those have a different status under the Constitution from the territories. But I think my point was just that where Congress is acting with respect to something federal, it's exercising national legislative power and it's creating national executive offices.
That's not what it's doing here. It put a Board inside the Puerto Rican government.
Now, yes, it wanted it independent from other Puerto Rican actors that it thought had played a role in this debt crisis.
But that's a very different thing from putting it in the federal government and exercising federal power.
It was reorganizing the Puerto Rican government.
That is a quintessential exercise of Article IV power. And I don't think, by the way, Justice Kagan and Kavanaugh, that the history is a wash. It's not just the early Washington mayors. Territorial judges were federally appointed, never treated as federal officers.
Early territorial upper houses, the -- the D.C. Control Board.
D.C. judges, to this day, are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
They've never been treated as federal officers.
They do not have lifetime tenure and a guaranteed salary. Federal appointment has never been the hallmark of whether you are federal or territorial.
The hallmark has always been, as Mr. Verrilli said, what kind of power are you exercising? Well, that's a question I -- I mean, you're representing the federal government.
If you lost, would they appoint the same people? The President has nominated the same people. Okay.
Now, if that's so and if you lose, but if we were to follow Judge Terrea and say the de facto officer doctrine, what difference would it make? So there are two separate things with respect to the -- to the remedy, Justice Breyer.
If the Court agrees with us on the de facto officer doctrine, that takes care of the Board's acts running up through the Court's decision. Going forward, I think all the parties now agree we still need a stay of the mandate because you'd have to give Congress the opportunity to confirm a new Board.
Otherwise, the Board would shut down over night.
You wouldn't have a Board. Yeah. So you've got to give the Senate time to act.
Right? And then that new Board would pick up where the old Board left off. But they would be the same people.
And so what you're talking about is a delay of possibly days while the Senate gets its act together to confirm the people that they already recommended to the President with one exception.
I mean, are we talking -- is that what we're talking about? You win, and there's no delay; you lose, assuming Judge Terrea's right, and there's a slight delay? That's what this case is about? Well, I -- On that assumption? I hope we're not in a world where we lose, and I would love to tell you that it won't be a big deal in that world, but it's going to be a little more complicated that. They're almost certain to argue that the nominations have expired and that even though the Senate has confirmed people before to expired terms, it can't do that here.
Even if we win that argument and even if the Senate committee reports them out and even if the Senate gets them through the floor during the period of the stay and we get a new Board, then they're going to argue that Board has to ratify everything that was done during the period of the stay, and they're going to challenge that ratification, and, of course, that ratification will extend backward in time, further and further, depending on what you do with the de facto officer doctrine. The -- the -- the big question on -- So, I mean, we're litigating for years on that view.
It's just a question of how much we're going to have to litigate with them if we -- if -- if the Court decides we're wrong on the merits. Mr. -- Mr. Wall, do you have to still litigate that here? You're making an assumption that the de facto doctrine does go as far as you say, which is to deprive a winning party of no remedy whatsoever. That's not true.
They will get prospective remedy as all of the litigants did in the de facto officer cases, including Buckley.
It -- the second this Court's stay expires, the Board can no longer act with respect to Aurelius, Assured, UTIER, or anybody else. What the de facto officer doctrine says is, even though you get meaningful prospective relief, we don't invalidate everything done moving backward in time that the officers are alleged to have done while invalidly appointed. And so -- and I think that's critical here because the Board's been acting for three years.
We have, you know, nearly 100 adversary proceedings, hundreds of thousands of claims, hundreds of millions of dollars collected or paid out, 12 billion dollars in bonds issued in the COFINA Title III proceeding that have been traded on the secondary -- on the market something like 85,000 times. I mean, I have no idea how one unwinds this, and I don't think that -- that Aurelius and UTIER have given any real way to do it.
And that's exactly what the de facto officer doctrine is for.
We don't wipe everything out in the past. But I do want to say that I don't think we get to that.
I don't think the merits here are -- are close.
Congress did its homework.
It invoked Article IV.
It told us where it was putting it -- I thought your argument would be that if you lost, there would also be a lot of legal ramifications in terms of calling into question the status of elected governors, judges, territorial judges, and the like.
Is that not the case? Well, I think it depends on which of their four or maybe five tests you pick.
They start with Buckley.
If they're serious about that, which has significant authority under federal law, that's the D.C. mayor, city council, the Guam and Virgin Island governors, and all territorial legislators and judges.
All of that authority flows directly from federal law, whether an organic act or the D.C. Home Rule Act. So then they tweak Buckley to say: Well, not if you're elected.
And then I say: Well, but you still don't solve D.C. judges, territorial judges, Washington mayors, early territorial upper houses, or the D.C. Control Board. And then they say: Well, it's executing federal law, maybe it's a special law, maybe it's federal objectives, maybe it's federal removal and there's a hodgepodge of other factors thrown in there. If the Court accepts those, notwithstanding that there are historical counter-examples to every one of those tests, then I suppose you could try to carve out the test in just the way as to pick this up.
But I don't think there's any principled way to do it. All of the federal authority that these territorial officers and D.C. officers exercise flows from federal law. And if you take their test seriously, yes, Justice Kavanaugh, it will threaten to undermine, indeed I think it would condemn in its entirety, home rule. I mean -- and -- and that just points out -- I mean, there's both an upper-level and a lower-level disruption here.
The lower-level disruption is undoing three years of what the Board has done to try to stabilize the condition in Puerto Rico. The upper-level disruption is every test they've got runs smack dab into history, and every test they've got would federalize some number of officers who have always been thought of as territorial or local, whether in D.C. or in the territories. And -- and -- like I say, I mean, from 1802 to now, I mean, if -- if -- if Mr. Olson is serious that significant authority under federal law makes you a federal officer, well, then, so too the D.C. judges who -- That's assuming that the immediate -- that you're looking at the ultimate source, which is a double jeopardy idea.
And our -- and our opinion in Sanchez Valle made it very clear that it was limited to that.
Much different result if you limit it to what's the immediate source. Oh, yes, I don't disagree that that's kind of an -- an ad hoc limitation that they've thrown on to try to avoid the consequences of their view.
But just to refine what you said a little bit, Justice Sotomayor, what -- what I took Justice Kagan's opinion to be saying in Sanchez Valle is, look, there are other ways you could have defined sovereignty or you could have looked at sovereignty, but, if we're looking at source of authority, the source of authority here flows from federal law. Well, their test is a source test. Their test is Buckley.
Did you get significant authority from federal law? So maybe there are other tests they could have tried to come up with, but theirs is a source test. But you could say that about the states.
The Constitution is the source of their power because the compact with the United States -- with -- their very existence is dependent on that.
But we don't define what a state act is or a federal act by their original source. Oh, well -- We define it by who passed the law, the state or the federal government. Well, except that under their test, and I think under Sanchez Valle, you've got to look at where that power flowed from, where did you get that authority.
And they keep saying authority under federal law. Okay, well, if that's your test, all of that authority, whether with respect to D.C. or the territories, flows from federal law. And, of course, the problem with the test, Justice Sotomayor, is Buckley is a significance test.
It takes an officer who's got concededly federal power and says how significant is their power? Are they an employee or are they an officer? It's not designed to answer the predicate question of, well, are they exercising federal power or territorial power? That's the question that Palmore gets at.
Is it a D.C. court or is it an Article III court? And the only way you know that is by asking two questions: One, did Congress invoke Article I or did it invoke Article IV? And then, two -- I've not even -- I -- I -- -- did it do anything under Article I or Article IV that -- Why do you bother with the third? If you give the first -- assuming that, as your adversary said, if Congress -- all it has to do is wave a magic wand, Article IV, and that that gives permission? Obviously not. Oh, it's still got to be -- it -- it -- it's got -- first, you've got to ask where it was trying to put the office.
That's the first step.
And then you've got to ask whether it had the constitutional power to do that thing.
Did it do something under Article I or under Article IV that it couldn't do? And the very first sentence of the court of appeals discussion is no one here has claimed that anything in PROMESA extends beyond Congress's reach under Article IV. And that's true.
There's not a word in these briefs from Aurelius or UTIER claiming that there is any power vested in the Board that is not among Congress's plenary power under Article IV.
That's the end of the analysis, I think, correctly understood. What was Congress doing? It was putting it in the territorial government.
Did it give it any power it didn't have under Article IV? They haven't claimed that it did. That under Palmore, I think, is the end of the analysis.
Congress invoked its plenary power.
It didn't do anything Article IV didn't give it the power to do. And, Mr. Wall, what is your answer to the question that Justice Sotomayor started off with about the difference between these Board members and a U.S. attorney? It's the same one that Mr. Verrilli gave, which is where you have executive officers who are acting under statutes of nationwide application, we think that that's best understood to be exercising federal -- How about -- -- executive power. -- if PROMESA had, instead of setting it up the way it did, had just -- had amended Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy laws and said Puerto Rico instrumentalities get to use Chapter 9 the way everybody else does, then creates the Board to do that. Yeah, I -- What -- what of that? I -- I don't think the form of that matters.
You're asking the same two questions. Because there, there is a -- I -- I guess what I was suggesting was that on -- on that there would be a uniform national law. Oh, I -- I think you'd have to ask the same two questions.
Was Congress doing that under the bankruptcy clause in Article I or doing it under the Territory Clause in Article IV to just create or extend those laws to the territory? And then did it do -- did it put any powers in that office that it couldn't have under Article IV.
So I think it'd be the same answer if, when extending the bankruptcy statute, it had said we're extending a similar system to Puerto Rico.
We're invoking Article IV.
We are creating this new board to oversee these new bankruptcy proceedings.
And we are putting that in the Puerto Rican government. Well, then it doesn't seem to have much to do with whether the law is nationwide or not, because my hypothetical was nationwide law, and you're saying it wouldn't matter because Congress said it was using Article IV. But it's got to be more than -- So -- -- what Congress said, right? -- so I -- I think that is pressing at exactly the tough question, which I'm going to say fortunately is not presented here, because it's a territory-specific statute and it's only acting in the territory. But Palmore does say primarily local. And it's a little tough to figure out exactly what it means. It seems to think that, if you're doing the D.C. code most of the time, rather than federal statutes most of the time, adjudicating, you're local, which seems to point up that you can do a little bit of the nationwide thing without converting into a federal officer. And we know that's true of territorial judges.
That's the best historical example. They were hearing matters in the territory, but they were adjudicating them under federal law. So I think that you're asking a really tough question about, well, what does local mean? Does it mean you're doing only the local matters, or does it go to the geographic scope of the statute under which you act? I think it's tough.
Palmore seems to indicate the scope of the statute might matter. History seems to indicate it might not if what you're doing is local.
And, again, all I can say is I think this is the easy case because here we -- Although this case -- -- check both boxes. -- isn't all that different from my hypothetical, right, because essentially what PROMESA does is it replicates all the procedures of Chapter 9.
I mean, it's not coming up with a new thing. I mean, it -- it's similar in most respects, but I actually don't think that changes the analysis. I mean, when the Detroit mayor walks in under Chapter 9 and files for municipal bankruptcy, we don't think that simply because he has invoked some power granted to him by federal law that he becomes a federal officer. I mean, here, the Board basically represents the Commonwealth.
It's almost like the debtor.
All it does is, if the Commonwealth says restructure our debt, it walks in and files the petition in federal court. It then basically represents the debtor, not different from any other state or municipality, tries to work out the claims with the creditor, and then ultimately Judge Swain has to sort out the plan and confirm something in the bankruptcy. So I don't think in that respect it's acting any differently from any state or locality that declares under Chapter 9.
It's still -- under Palmore, it's still focused on local matters. Everything the Board is doing, it's doing in Puerto Rico, which is why I don't think they've tried to claim, look, you needed any Article I power.
All you needed was Article IV. Suppose Congress invokes Article IV and puts it in the territorial government, as it's done here, but assigns some matters that -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's questions -- are more national than local. Is the remedy for that problem to say that that officer can't perform the more national duties, or is the remedy for that to say that the -- the office is invalid because it's appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause? Well, first, Justice Kavanaugh, I don't want to -- to grant that that office would be unconstitutional.
It's pressing.
It's a tough question Justice Kagan was getting at.
So what does Palmore mean by primarily? It seems to leave some room to do nationwide or federal things as long as you are focused on the territory. But if you assume that it's got to be exclusive -- a test that I think we meet here -- I think it's a hard question what the remedy would be. I think you'd still have the de facto officer potentially going -- Well, I'm asking a -- -- outside -- -- different question. -- unless it's an adjudicator. Wouldn't -- wouldn't the officer still be a valid territorial officer but perhaps exercising some duties that he or she cannot exercise? I think that's a potential remedy.
We haven't looked at that here.
We haven't briefed it.
I do think that it kind of -- it highlights the oddity of the other side's claim. It's not as if they're pointing to some federal power provision in PROMESA that you -- Well, I think it highlights the difficulty, as Justice Kagan said, at the primarily local, because the word ""primarily,"" you were very careful in your brief to have that each time you articulate the test. And I'm not sure how we're supposed to figure that out. Justice Kavanaugh, I think you need it there.
We've known since Cantor in 1826 that territorial judges are not federal officers.
And yet they are adjudicating cases under federal law.
They had general federal jurisdiction, just like state courts.
It -- it was exclusive until 1875. So I think you've got to have some primary test in there.
I think you're going to have difficult cases at the margins.
And all I can fall back on is this is not a difficult case because, here, there's nothing in PROMESA that needed to be an exercise of Article I.
By its terms, it is limited to the territory. It's not as if they can point you to some federal provisions of PROMESA that grant the federal power that you could just excise. It says represent the Commonwealth in the following ways.
And -- and I do -- I do -- and I think this is the best way to capture it. Congress could have given these powers to the governor and the legislature.
They'd already -- they already had many of them.
They could adjust debt.
They could propose budgets and fiscal plans.
The governor otherwise would have represented the Commonwealth in the Title III proceedings. If they had created the Title III proceeding but not otherwise specified that the Board would play a role, and the governor had filed this petition, I don't think anyone believes that would have converted the governor into a federal officer, any more than the mayor of Detroit or anybody else. To say just a quick word on the -- on the -- on the remedy.
As we tried to say, I think there are two things at play, the de facto officer doctrine, to ensure you have not applied it to adjudicators, that's Ryder, but you have more than a dozen cases applying it to legislative and executive bodies, that's Buckley. This is an executive body that's not doing adjudication.
Right? So I think it falls squarely within that -- it -- that set of cases. And, indeed, I think it's sort of the classic case for that, given the immense reliance interests that have been built up on the Board over the next three years, going forward, everybody agrees we need a stay in order to confirm a new Board, if you decide we're wrong on the merits.
I think the right model there is Northern Pipeline.
That was six months.
Same thing here. You've got to get them out of committee.
You've got to get them through the floor.
They're going to have to do some amount of ratification.
And then they're going to have to act going forward. At a minimum, though, I'd say we need three months with the ability to come back and report progress just like what we did in the First Circuit, because we've got to allow Congress and then the Board some time to -- to act. If the Board is shut down in Puerto Rico, I do think it imperils a process on which we have made really substantial gains in the last three years in trying to stabilize the island's finances.
And I can't stress to the Court how important it is that the Board be allowed to continue to do that work. Thank you. Thank you, General. Mr. Olson. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Federalist 48, James Madison anticipated what Congress attempted to do with the PROMESA oversight board, masking under complicated and indirect measures its encroachment on coordinate departments.
Drawing all power into its impetuous vortex, he urged all precautions against the enterprising ambition of this department. PROMESA was a response to a national financial crisis affecting millions of American citizens, including 3 million citizens, American citizens, in Puerto Rico. The PROMESA Board is appointed, supervised, and removable by the President of the United States, reports regularly on its budget and decisions to federal officials, and makes recommendations -- it's required to do so under the statute -- for changes in PROMESA and other federal laws -- other federal laws. It presides over the largest municipal bankruptcy proceeding in United States history, managing over 100 billion dollars in indebtedness, 165,000 claims, including over 200 claw-back actions, lawsuits against major financial institutions, in a proceeding in an Article III district court designated by the Chief Justice of the United States. The Board was effectively chosen -- these are the words of the congressional committee -- effectively chosen by members of Congress, all without the advice and consent of the Senate. The Appointments Clause is central to the separation of powers, without which, in the words of the framers, we have the very definition of tyranny.
It was a response to the most insidious and powerful weapon of 18th-century despots. If the Board were elected, would it be constitutional? No, it would not be constitutional because -- how -- and -- and -- Doesn't that mean the Puerto Rico governor election is unconstitutional as well then? No, because the Puerto Rican authorities that are given to the Puerto Rican governor and under the Puerto Rican legislature are primarily local activities.
I just described what the PROMESA's Board powers are.
They are national in scope.
They bring cases in federal court against U.S. citizens. They conduct an extensive investigation of the oversight -- over the underwriting practices, the bond rating situation with respect to this -- All on behalf of Puerto Rico and its people and its agencies. The Board is instructed to act not on behalf of the United States but on behalf of Puerto Rico in pressing these claims? Justice Ginsburg, it is not on behalf of Puerto Rico.
It is not an internal Puerto Rican operation.
It is an oversight board. This Board has the power to prescribe a budget for Puerto Rico.
It has the power to veto decisions of the governor of Puerto Rico and the legislature of Puerto Rico.
It has the power and has sued the governor of Puerto Rico and government -- Puerto Rican officials.
It's called an oversight board because it is not internal to Puerto Rico.
It -- Well, but its oversight concerns -- every sentence you just said there, it's of Puerto Rico, of Puerto Rico. Its focus is on Puerto Rico. Yes, the activities, as things in any of the territories often do, has broader impact. I get -- I'll get back to the question I asked your friend, Mr. Verrilli. What if we -- I mean, I think it's very artificial to look at this and say, is this local or is this national? It obviously is some of each, or even the local aspects certainly have national implications. So, again, I mean, where -- where do we -- I know what your answer is, but you could explain it.
What do you do with -- what -- what do I do if I view it as some of each? Well, it is overwhelmingly a federal problem dealing with a federal issue. In the -- in the Limtiaco case just in 2007, with an issue involving insolvency or potential insolvency of Guam, this Court said this is not a local problem.
This is the -- the insolvency of a territory is a national -- is a national issue.
It's a federal issue. The concern of the United States -- this is in a sense a little bit like the Lebron case or other cases where this Court has said the Congress is dealing with a significant federal problem.
It has come up with a federal solution and has given this Board powers over citizens all over the United States. But I think the response on the other side is that they've taken some of the powers and responsibilities that belonged to the governor and to the legislature and given them to the Board, and the governor, as you acknowledged, is elected, not appointed consistent with the Appointments Clause. So is that wrong that they've taken the powers from the governor and legislature and given them to the Board? They've taken all of the powers with respect to the financial situation in Puerto Rico and given it to the federal-created Board, which is appointed by the President, removable by the President, and has supervisorial authorities under the -- the very statute -- But, Mr. Olson, I -- I think the question is -- Mr. Olson -- -- if, but for this statute -- Right. -- who would -- who would be doing these activities? And if it would be the governor of Puerto Rico -- The governor -- -- then doesn't that tell us something? The governor of Puerto Rico does not have the power to do these activities. I understand that. But for this statute, who would? Wouldn't it be the governor? That's what -- No. -- that's what your colleagues -- But for the statute, this authority to do -- That's what your colleagues suggest. Well -- And -- and is -- if that's erroneous, could you direct us to what -- who would do it but for the statute? The statute was created because the -- the governor of Puerto Rico -- and there was no authority for officials in Puerto Rico to do these responsibilities, to bring these actions -- these actions against financial institutions in the mainland, to bring -- to overturn the budget, to do these various things, to bring suit against the governor himself. Why couldn't they? Why couldn't they? They'd pass a law, a Puerto Rican law, which would give them authority to do it. They -- they would not have the power to have the reach that this What? Give me an example.
I mean, if the legislature and governor wanted to do it, they would pass a law. They would represent Puerto Rico in the bankruptcy proceeding. Well -- this -- They would -- they would take care of the problem. That case was before this Court just a couple of years ago. Which? The -- the case involving whether or not Puerto Rico could use the bankruptcy statutes to do -- No, no, no, I'm -- I'm saying we set up a -- what -- what I think you're being asked by several of us is: Look at all the powers that the -- that the Board has. Aren't they powers that the Puerto Rican government could exercise if it had the legislative and gubernatorial will? I submit -- Which one couldn't it? I think virtually all of them, Justice Breyer.
This is a long statute prescribing an enormous range of powers, given the ability to overturn decisions of the governor, to reverse -- You know, I understand that, but I don't want to repeat my question.
You see what my question was? I do see what your -- Mr. Olson, I think the basic question, if I can simplify it, I believe, is couldn't the governor of Puerto Rico and the legislature have created their own fiscal rescue plan? Yes.
Correct? No, I don't believe so.
I think -- Why? -- that was the case that would give the authority to adjust debts, to accommodate the various different creditors, to -- to -- Oh, you're talking about -- we -- we are -- okay.
I guess your intention is that without PROMESA, the bankruptcy law wouldn't have changed to permit Puerto Rico -- It -- it would -- -- to file -- -- it would not. -- its action -- And this statute -- -- so -- -- went far beyond the bankruptcy powers.
The powers that are given to this Board are vastly greater than powers that are available on the -- Mr. Olson -- So what you're basically saying is, without this federal law creating this structure, the structure itself couldn't exist under existing law? That's correct. Justice Alito. So the legislature couldn't do it? That's correct. Mr. Olson, are you and your client here just to defend the integrity of the Constitution, or would one be excessively cynical to think that something else is involved here involving money? And, if so, what is it? What did the Board do that hurt your client? Well, with -- my -- aside from the constitutional right to an officer -- Well, I mean, are you -- are you and Aurelius here just as -- as amici to defend the Constitution, or do you have some kind of a concrete grievance? The process is not complete, Justice Alito.
The process is ongoing.
My client is being subjected to a process that is governed by officials that were appointed in violation of the separation of powers. So that sense, it isn't complete.
We can't describe the degree to which someone might have been hurt.
But the Court's -- this Court's said over and over again that it's fundamental that an officer of the United States must be appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause. That is fundamental to the separation of powers, which is fundamental to the Constitution -- I mean, you don't have to answer this if you don't want to, but there is no money issue involved here? (Laughter.) Of course, there -- of course, there -- Well, what is it? There's over -- I'd just like to know what -- this is a real case.
I'd like to know what's really going on here. Well, there's -- there's over 100 billion dollars of indebtedness being adjudicated in various procedures, a lot of which is -- Right, and your client wants more of it and somebody else you think is getting too much.
So what is it exactly? If you want to answer.
If not -- We can't -- we can't possibly answer that.
There are these extraordinarily large claims which the governor -- which the agencies of Puerto Rico have defaulted on, have not been able to pay these claims. So, yes, you're right.
Of course, it involves a lot of money.
And the money is in a process that's being adjudicated by a federal district judge appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States. Didn't your client acquiesce in some settlement? There was a settlement of one small piece of it that was -- that had nothing to do with -- at -- at no time did my clients relinquish their constitutional claims or recede from them in any way. There was a small settlement with respect to a taxing authority where the sales tax went into an agency.
And that part of it has been resolved.
And we've agreed not to challenge -- my clients have agreed not to challenge that settlement in any way. So that's a bit of a -- Mr. Olson -- But this one you have agreed to challenge, and why, you are challenging? Pardon? What is the difference between what you agreed to and you're not challenging and now what you're challenging? What we're challenging is the remaining part of the procedure, which is the giant part of it.
This is a small piece of it that was settled in some way and -- and there was really basically no choice because the Board was ongoing and a settlement was reached with respect to a small segment of the resources. But in no way did my clients relinquish its constitutional rights to an appointment under the Appointments Clause. Mr. Olson -- I see that, and I wanted to ask you a question -- One thing -- there was one thing that -- -- that I think you may -- I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg? -- that -- that confuses me about your presentation, because you start out very strongly that the evil here is Congress aggrandizing itself, Congress aggrandizing itself at the executive's expense. How about the member of the Board that's appointed by the President alone? There can't be any question of Congress aggrandizing itself.
Congress has given the President alone that authority. So would it be unconstitutional in your view if all of the members were appointed by the President and not subject to the advice and consent? I don't get how that -- They would -- they -- these are principal officers of the United States, not inferior officers.
Therefore, principal officers under the Constitution must be appointed, nominated by the President -- But what does that have to do with Congress aggrandizing itself at the executive's expense? Well, the -- the -- they -- the President appointed one without advice and consent of the Senate.
That violates the Appointments Clause.
The other were pursuant to lists -- How about the D.C. Control Board, where they're all appointed -- Well, there's -- -- by the President? -- that has never been adjudicated.
The government itself in connection with the D.C. Control Board took the position in an Office of Legal Counsel opinion that that was a federal agency. There has never been a resolution of that.
The D.C. Control Board has vastly more limited powers with respect to local matters. And our -- our opponents bring up and rely on the Palmore case, which had nothing to do with the Appointments Clause.
It wasn't an adjudication or wasn't -- They bring up -- -- a discussion of -- Excuse me.
They bring up home rule more generally.
And that's of serious concern here, is if you were to prevail here, what would that do for home rule and the territories with elected governors? What would it do for the District of Columbia with the elected mayor, city council, the judges' appointments? How, if you were to prevail here, would the line be drawn so that it does not affect home rule? It would not affect home rule at all.
Now people might make the argument that PROMESA itself affected in some way because it took over the responsibility of the -- of the Puerto Rican officials to set financial conditions, establish a budget -- budget, and all of those things. But the outcome in favor of my clients in this case would simply mean that the same officials would be appointed pursuant to the Constitution.
It wouldn't change home rule. All of the cases that we've relied upon -- But wouldn't it require that similar officials -- maybe I'm not understanding -- in the territories who exercise territorial power, but also affect national power? What -- what -- I think the issue might be primarily federal power or versus primarily local. The Palmore case itself, which our opponents rely on repeatedly, says in that opinion those were primarily or exclusively or largely -- there are various different adjectives used in that opinion -- local D.C. criminal proceedings, criminal law under the laws of the District of Columbia. And this Court has repeatedly likened the power that can be exercised in the territories under the territorial clause or under the clause that gives power over the District of Columbia local territorial matters, the type of authority that may be given by a state to a local municipality. Congress enacts the D.C. code, right? The D.C. code is enacted by Congress? Yes, although -- well, there is -- it's changed over time.
But -- but at -- at a certain point in time, yes.
But -- but the fact is that there is a difference between primarily local authority, and that's discussed in the -- in the Palmore case.
The reason that those -- So -- so that does sound like the test that is being used by Mr. Verrilli and Mr. Wall.
I mean, they've said that your test is kind of malleable. And I guess what I'd like, what is your test? The test -- my test is this Court's test, which was articulated in the Buckley case, again in the -- in the -- But you know what -- what struck me -- -- in the Lucia case. -- what struck me when I read that, when I read your brief, the Buckley test is significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.
I guess what struck me was that in many -- on many occasions you modified that test in your brief. You said significant federal authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.
And when you do that, it strikes me that you're coming actually pretty close, I mean, and if you agree on a test, that seems not a bad thing.
It seems as though, when you say significant federal authority, you're coming pretty close to what Mr. Wall and Mr. Verrilli have proposed. Well, we looked at each of the cases that are cited both in our briefs and our opponents' briefs, including the United States' briefs. The -- it is -- it is -- and it's the test of this Court, not just in the Buckley case, but as -- as recently -- as recently as a couple years ago in the Lucia case.
It's the same case.
But -- Right, but always -- always to distinguish between officers and employees.
And what I'm suggesting is that when you apply it to this situation, your own briefs modify the test by talking about federal authority and implicitly comparing federal authority to local authority. And we acknowledge that, that with respect to the test that this Court articulated, repeatedly, Lucia was just the last time it did, that authority under the laws of the United States has always accepted the -- the purely local authority that's been exercised in the territories. So if it's -- There's also exceptions for transitional governments.
The Philippines, for example.
There was a local government and then it was replaced -- Mr. Olson, I'm -- I'm confused.
I honestly don't understand what the difference between your test and the government's test is in this case. If you could articulate that in a few sentences, I'd be grateful. The test is -- The difference between the two tests. Well, the difference between the two is that we believe, and what -- what this Court has taught us, that if you're exercising significant authority under the laws of the United States, the laws enacted by Congress with respect to the government, affairs of the federal government, as opposed to purely local municipal, the -- the speed limits, the zoning -- I understand -- I understand the test.
My question is, what's the difference between that and the question asking whether the individual or the Board is acting primarily locally or primarily nationally? It -- the -- the -- What's the difference? What's the delta? The -- the delta is, is something that is a municipal matter, is it -- have to do with local affairs, speed limits, zoning, and things of that nature, as opposed to federal statutes that deal with a national crisis. This was a national crisis, a national -- Could I rephrase that as asking whether the Board was acting primarily locally or primarily nationally? It is -- the Board is acting primarily nationally. Okay.
So we do agree on a test then? Pardon me? So then we do agree on the test, right, whether the Board was acting primarily locally or primarily nationally? Well, that part of it, yes. Okay. Because those -- what this Court has said repeatedly is that, where there is local municipal authority, Congress has the power under Article IV to give government and -- and regulate the affairs in municipalities. So if it's primarily -- Mr. Olson -- As -- Justice Sotomayor. -- I don't want you to ignore the de facto officer.
But just to finish this, there's this nuance between you and your adversaries on are you dealing primarily with a local matter? And they would say dealing with a budget, dealing with running the government, that's all local. You are attempting to say something different, but I'm not sure what that difference is, because, when they use the words primarily local matters, that's the way I understand them to be using it. The -- the test -- They -- they can obviously correct me if I'm wrong. Well -- But they're saying this Board is dealing with primarily local matters because it's dealing primarily with a budget and with -- And that's not -- That -- that -- that's -- okay. With all due respect, you cannot say that at the same time that you've read the PROMESA statute itself.
And this Court -- Well, I -- I've read it, but that doesn't mean I know what you're referring to. Could you succinctly make the -- the difference between how you view primarily dealing with -- Well -- -- in your way and the way the other side does? -- the insolvency of a territory of the United States is not a local matter.
That's what this Court said in the Limtiaco case in 2007.
The -- and -- and that's what Congress was saying when it was dealing with the enactment of this statute. We have a fiscal catastrophe, a humanitarian crisis involving millions of citizens, 3 million American citizens in Puerto Rico, but citizens all over the United States who are owed money by the government of Puerto Rico or agencies of the government of Puerto -- So, Mr. Olson -- -- Rico. Counsel, it's just then -- it -- it's just a question of size. I mean, if the same thing, we're talking about not Puerto Rico, but Ponce -- see, I don't know the pronunciation -- Puerto Rico, your position would be different? Or a county in Puerto Rico? I think that it's possible that you could find a fiscal insolvency situation of a small enough unit of a -- of a portion of Puerto Rico where you wouldn't be talking about this, but Guam, which is what this Court talked about in that case, Limtiaco case, was 1/400th the size of Puerto Rico, involving that tiny fraction of the significance of Puerto Rico. We're talking here about not just the size but the dimension of the problem, the number of citizens that are involved, the number of creditors' claims, over 200 claw-back claims against financial institutions throughout the United States that are being pursued in federal court. This is a -- So would it be right to say, Mr. Olson, that you view this statute as essentially a statute about debt restructuring? I mean, it has other aspects and the Board does other things and oversees Puerto Rican budgets going forward, but you're saying that what we should do is look at the statute and say it's about restructuring a bankrupt territory's debt and that that has to be viewed as national? Is that the theory? Well, that is part of the theory.
And as -- as the United States repeatedly said with respect to, in the Freytag case, the deputy solicitor general was asked a question about what if the governor of Puerto Rico was appointed by Congress or a federal official? And the response from the federal government was that would invoke in every case the Appointments Clause. Did that deputy solicitor general prevail on that position? (Laughter.) That deputy solicitor general made a beautiful argument, Mr. Chief Justice. (Laughter.) And -- and fortunately for him -- A beautiful losing argument. -- the Court did not decide that precise case.
But that -- but that argument that was made is the same argument that the United States has made in 22 OLC in 1978, when it was talking about Guam, in 31 OLC in the brief in the Hechinger case, which was the follow-on to the Metropolitan Washington Authority's case, that was a very, very important case. If we conclude that the powers and duties here are primarily local -- and I know you disagree -- but, if we conclude that, do you lose? The -- I suspect that if there's -- if there's an agency in Puerto Rico that's dealing with purely local problems, like the -- You keep -- -- like the article -- -- you keep saying -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
You keep saying ""purely local."" Well, primarily, I'll -- Okay. -- accept that, primarily. There's a big difference between -- Well, there's a big -- it may be a big difference and it may be important in this case.
Palmore case was talking about relative -- it wasn't purely local, but it was primarily local.
The Court used exclusively, but I think the Court meant in the Palmore case those courts that were dealing with problems in the District of Columbia involving District of Columbia criminal laws. So if your -- the focus is on that, of course, there are state officials that can enforce federal law.
That's always been the case from the beginning of the Constitution.
So it is primarily what's being involved here. This is the -- the Congressional Budget Office itself looked at this particular statute and said this is a federal office.
The Lebron case that looked at Amtrak -- Can I just try the question again? If we conclude it's primarily local, do you have an alternative argument or do you lose? Well, I don't -- I don't -- I think that it can't conceivably be thought of as primarily local given the scope of the authority, but I'm imagining a hypothetical situation where you might have a small unit of -- of government, a subdivision of Puerto Rico that was purely a municipal problem, yes, that could be a -- that could not invoke the Appointments Clause, but -- Mr. Olson, don't lose the de facto officer argument. Yes.
The de facto -- this Court decided 24 years ago unanimously, in an opinion by -- written by the then Chief Justice, that when there is a decision, a challenge, a timely challenge to an Appointments Clause violation, one who makes -- to use the words of that Court -- one who makes a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case and, legislative or adjudicative -- these are Article I issues, so there really isn't any difference there -- is entitled to a decision on the merits and whatever relief may be appropriate. I heard the government say just a few minutes ago that we've done all these things, we've made all those decisions, so put the Constitution aside, let us continue to do it. Let us have the fruits of the decisions that we made with unconstitutional officers who could never have even filed -- I think that they are making a distinction between adjudicatory and legislative decisions. I don't think -- They seem to be saying that when it comes to legislative officers, that we have applied the de facto officer status.
In more recent times, you're absolutely right, with adjudicatory officers, we have said no, you have to give people a new hearing. So deal with that distinction -- Well -- -- and deal with why that's wrong. -- I don't think that there is a valid distinction in -- in a vacuum between an adjudicatory process.
Look at the Lucia case, was an Administrative Law Judge that was exercising what the Court perceived as partially adjudicative problems, but also conducting Article I activities, enforcing the laws of the United States. And this agency has that same authority.
It overlaps both. But the Ryder case, on which you placed such reliance, it -- it was qualified.
It said the defendant could object to the mode of appointment of a judge who adjudicates his case.
And this Board is not adjudicating any cases.
The -- the federal district court is. Justice Ginsburg, I would submit that the -- the -- this Board is both adjudicating and enforcing the laws in the same sense, and has many of the same powers that the administrative law judge had in the Lucia case, and so that that distinction simply doesn't hold up. It was acting on behalf of the debtor agency in Puerto Rico. They -- it's acting as a kind of a petitioner. It's not an adjudicator. That's one of the -- one small part of what PROMESA does.
That has to do with 165,000 claims.
It doesn't have to do with overturning the -- the budget, changing the financial structure of Puerto Rico, suing in -- in federal courts citizens of the United States outside of Puerto Rico in connection with financial claims, claw-back claims, they call them in the financial insolvency concept. If one were to look at all of the authorities, and I was -- have to finish with the point that these officials are appointed by the President of the United States, an officer of the United States, removable by the President, and that what this Court said in the Bowsher case, that means that that's the official that they must fear and therefore obey, and is supervised in Section 2148, 2121, 2127, 2143. These are reports, recommendations, responsibilities that the oversight board must constantly give to officials of the United States and, therefore, supervision. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mendez-Colberg. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to address the issue of the Insular Cases, the remedy, and also some of the questions -- the questions of the Court. If we stand in front of this building, we will see the words ""equal justice under law."" The Insular Cases stretch that tenet into its breaking point.
The court-made doctrine of territorial incorporation means that when my client, and even myself, return to Puerto Rico, we will have a lesser set of constitutional rights than what we have standing here today. On the other hand, the First Circuit decided that my clients suffered a constitutional injury, but still they were left without a remedy.
Equal justice under law should mean the same thing here in D.C. than in Puerto Rico. It should reject ideas grounded on class -- it should reject classifications grounded in ideas of alien races and savage people.
It should also mean that when there is a constitutional injury, justice requires a remedy. Now, in this case, the -- the First Circuit stated correctly that the Insular Cases hover like a dark cloud over this case.
And it is true, because the opposing parties have been relying on the Insular Cases since the beginning of the proceedings to establish that even the structural provisions of the Constitution don't apply to the people of Puerto Rico because -- I think here -- I understood -- -- everybody was -- everybody was agreeing that the Article I -- Article II does apply.
And so whether you have the Insular Cases or not, and I agree they're a dark cloud, but the -- the -- the -- it doesn't matter here because the provision of the Constitution does apply. And I thought what was more, which I've been trying to work out, and you may have looked into this, is what about the Federal Relations Act? You see, if -- if, in fact, you -- you would be the one who might have thought of this. But it does give these powers to deal, and the deal is the legislature of Puerto Rico and the governor do this.
But there was a reservation. There was a reservation for the indebtedness. And that reservation was eventually repealed in '61.
And when it was repealed, the legislature passed a -- they passed a constitutional amendment in Puerto Rico promising that they would pay creditors and that they had some priorities and so forth. Now is that relevant? I've begun to think that the partnership, the Estado Libre Asociado, is -- is -- is more served by considering this a local law than considering it a federal law, because if a -- if it's a federal law, it really is hard to reconcile with the FRA, but not so hard if it's a local law. Have you thought about it at all? If you haven't thought of it, forget it. (Laughter.) I'm just -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I have a tough problem in my mind on that.
And if you have thought of it, I'd appreciate what you think. Well, Your Honor, we would forget about it, but the problem here is that, actually, what Congress did was to, yes, say that this -- that this are territorial officers, but it actually gave this -- the oversight board powers that are not necessarily what power -- what the powers of a -- of a territorial officer are considered to be. They -- the oversight board has the authority, and as Mr. Olson mentioned, has the authority to file this bankruptcy proceedings, which is a federal power, on behalf of the government. But, also, we see that they have the authority to impair contracts -- which is something that wasn't mentioned before -- impair contracts even outside of the -- of the scope of the bankruptcy proceedings, which is in the Title II -- II of PROMESA. If the Board understands that a contract may -- that the government -- by the government of Puerto Rico with other parties is inconsistent with the provisions of PROMESA, it can -- it can -- it can even prevent the execution of those -- of those contracts. So that is a very significant power among the other powers that the oversight board has that not even the -- the government, the local government of Puerto Rico, has. Now I do want to -- to -- to -- to stress on the issue of the Insular Cases, because it is important for the people of Puerto Rico and for my clients.
This is a -- a doctrine that has been, well, 118 years, that it -- that has been -- that has been good law. And, here, I want to stress that it is a -- it is a matter of overruling the Insular Cases, and the Doctrine of Territorial Incorporation, it is a matter of constitutional and law, but also a matter of who the United States is as a nation. Well, but Justice -- as Justice Breyer has pointed out, none of the other parties rely on the Insular Cases in any way.
So it would be very unusual for us to address them in this case, wouldn't it? Well, Your Honor, they relied on the Insular Cases since the beginning of the proceedings.
Actually, the -- the unsecured creditor -- creditors are still relying on the Insular Cases at this point. Now it is very convenient for the other parties to not -- to rely on the Insular Cases in the lower courts, where there is no authority to overrule those cases, but that -- but then when we come before this Court to say that they are not relevant. Still, as I -- as I was about to mention, the Insular Cases comply with all of the factors that this -- that this Court established in -- in Janus, especially the quality of the reasoning, because it is based purely on racial considerations, to say that some provisions of the Constitution don't apply to the unincorporated territories because they are of a different race.
That's the -- that's the root of that doctrine. Now, here -- I thought the argument was that the Appointments Clause does apply to Puerto Rico, and the question is simply whether it's implicated on these particular facts with respect to this particular agency? Yes, Your Honor. So I -- I guess, again, I just don't see the pertinence of the -- of the Insular Cases. Well, as I -- as I mentioned, and also -- also, last term, this Court went ahead and overruled the Corimatchu case.
In the Trump versus Hawaii case, the Court said that the case had nothing to do with the Trump versus Hawaii case.
But still it was a morally repugnant doctrine that was purely on the basis -- considering the basis of race, and, therefore, it was overruled. The same here with the Insular Cases. And I cannot stress enough that the parties have relied on the Insular Cases in this -- in this case.
That is why it's the -- the perfect opportunity to address them. Now -- Can I ask you a question about the duties of the Board? If the duties of the Board and responsibilities are considered primarily local -- I'll ask the same question I asked Mr. Olson -- do you lose or do you have an alternative argument? Your Honor, I -- I don't think that we -- that the -- the -- the authority of the Board can -- can -- can be considered purely local. I understand that. But, if -- if we conclude otherwise, is there an alternative argument, or is that the end of the case? Well, I -- I believe that there is the example of -- of D.C. judges who were still considered to be officers of the United States in the -- in the Weiss case.
So there is -- there are a couple other examples that this Court could -- could take. Now I would like -- Which D.C. -- which D.C. judges are you talking about? I thought the judges of the D.C. Superior Court and of the D.C. Court of Appeals are not -- are not federal judges. Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm talking about the -- the Weiss case. And -- but still the -- the -- the -- the issue of -- of the purely local affairs of -- of -- of the oversight board cannot stand if we look at the -- the authority that it was vested on these officers through PROMESA. Now I would like to address the remedy because I think that it is very important for -- for us to address that. My friends on the other side have mentioned the consequences of -- of this -- of this case in terms of millions of dollars.
But they have forgot about the impact to the people. What the -- what the opposing parties are asking this Court to validate through the de facto officer doctrine is a certification of the fiscal plan, which is not subject to judicial review, that imposes austerity measures on the people that has impaired contractual obligations, including the collective bargaining agreement of my clients, stripping them of -- of workers' rights like salaries, overpaying -- overpayment, and -- and medical -- medical benefits. But also we are talking about agreements with bondholders, with Dapapa, which is the UTIER's employers, that provides for the payment of the bond -- of the bonds ahead of the salaries, ahead of the -- of the contributions to the retirement system, and that it threatens the mere -- the mere feasibility of such an instrumentality. We are talking about 7,000 labor claims that were stayed because of the Title III proceedings, proceedings that were filed at the sole discretion of the oversight board, and that were -- that were left without a remedy. So -- and -- and -- and like I mentioned, the -- the budgets that establish the policy for the government of Puerto Rico, that it is done at the sole discretion of the oversight board because we cannot say that the government of Puerto Rico has participation. The -- if -- if the Board -- You can finish your sentence. Yes, thank you. If the Board understands that the -- that the fiscal plan, which is the blueprint for all of these proceedings, or the budgets, are inconsistent with PROMESA, the Board can substitute for its own at its sole discretion. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Verrilli. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to make one overarching point on the merits and one point on remedy.
On the merits, I want to go at the sum of each question. I think, if you think the sum of each, I don't think you can resolve it based on effects.
I mean, if you think about it, the effects we're talking about here are not the Board's actions.
It was the issuance of the bonds and then the default by the government of Puerto Rico, the elected representatives of Puerto Rico.
So, if its effect is then they're officers of the United States, that can't be right and it's just not an administrable test. It can't be whether they are enforcing federal law. Mr. Olson raised the Limtiaco case. That case proves our point.
The statute he's talking about in that case requiring fiscal solvency was enforced by the governor and the legislature, who are not appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause but elected.
So, if he's right about that, Guam's government is unconstitutional.
And it also would mean that the D.C. government, from the -- from the beginning until home rule, was unconstitutional because they were enforcing federal statutes. So that can't be right. It can't be based on the source of authority.
They're really not arguing that anymore.
And even if you wanted to accept the intermediate authority point, you -- and try to carve out Puerto Rico that way, you can't save Guam, you can't save the Virgin Islands, you can't save home rule in D.C.
You basically blow everything else up if you adopt that standard, which is why they don't really advocate for it. So really it needs to be our test. Our test is one that's faithful to the text, it's faithful to the history, it rests on principle, it avoids threats to home rule, and it's administrable.
Maybe there are going to be hard questions on the margin and we discussed those today.
This is not a hard case.
This is exclusively territorial authority. Now, on remedy, I think Mr. Olson's answer to Justice Alito's question tells you all you need to know about what's going to happen next.
They brought this suit because they want a different Board.
They're perfectly entitled to do that.
They've every right to do that. But that's what they want because they don't like the way this Board is working out the debt problems. And so what you can be sure of, if we're in the remedies phase and I hope that we are not, but what you can be sure of if we are is that they are going to fight ratification by the Board tooth and nail for years and years and do everything possible to keep this thing in a situation in which they -- they -- they have the hope to get a different Board that will accomplish their objectives. So that's what will happen if we go down that path.
And I would strongly urge the Court not to do that.
If you do reach the remedial issue, then I think the de facto officer doctrine, a perfectly reasonable judgment, but more fundamentally, there is no reason to reach the remedial issue -- Mr. -- Mr. Verrilli -- -- to support as -- -- let -- -- constitutional -- -- let's say it is your test.
But let's also say that the crux of this statute -- there are some other things in it, but the crux of the statute is that it sets up a scheme for restructuring the debt of a bankrupt territory and -- on -- with the backdrop that that could not have been done under pre-PROMESA federal law by local officials themselves.
Why is it primarily local? May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice? Yes. Two things.
First, you wouldn't think that the mayor of Detroit was converted into a federal official because he took Detroit into bankruptcy under Chapter 9. He's still exercising his local power.
Same with the Board. And, second, again, the question I think has to be whose interests is -- is the Board advancing in that process? It's the court, the Article III court, that engages in the broad adjustment of interests here to achieve a -- a nationwide result. The Board's job, as the statute expressly says, is to act on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico and the government of Puerto Rico as its representative.
It's an advocate for Puerto Rico, and that's why it's territorial authority.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1048, GE Energy Power Conversion France versus Outokumpu. Mr. Dvoretzky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If this case involved a domestic arbitration agreement, GE Energy could enforce it as long as it could satisfy domestic non-signatory enforcement doctrines like equitable estoppel.
The question here is whether the New York Convention prohibits that same result for international arbitration agreements.
It does not. The Convention is simply silent about enforcement by non-signatories.
That silence is consistent with the Convention's design, which sets a floor, not a ceiling, for enforcing arbitration agreements and awards.
The Convention says that states must do certain things to promote arbitration.
It doesn't say they can't to do more than the Convention requires. Moreover, Article II, the principal provision about arbitration agreements, is especially short.
It is not a comprehensive scheme that displaces all sovereign authority to enforce domestic laws about arbitration agreements. All relevant sources of meaning understand the Convention this same way.
Other contracting states are close to unanimous that the Convention does not preempt domestic law allowing non-signatory enforcement.
The United States, the Restatement, UNCITRAL, and leading commentators agree.
In allowing doctrines like equitable estoppel serves the Convention's overriding purpose, to overcome widespread resistance to arbitration. The Eleventh Circuit nevertheless interpreted the definition of ""agreement in writing"" to preclude non-signatory enforcement. This Court should not make the United States an outlier by adopting that position. Article II(2) just specifies the kinds of agreements that states at a minimum must recognize.
It doesn't limit who can enforce them. Respondents themselves don't defend the Eleventh Circuit's signature-based rule. They concede that all kinds of non-signatory enforcement doctrines, including even some kinds of equitable estoppel, are okay.
Just not the particular type of equitable estoppel here. That incoherent project of parsing some non-signatory enforcement doctrines from others has no basis in any of the tools of treaty interpretation. Mr. Dvoretzky, if -- if you and I have an agreement to arbitrate, and even if you tell me, you know, I -- I might have Mr. Hacker do most of the work under it, and I just want to make that clear to you, and then you do hire Mr. Hacker to do all the work in it. He can't be compelled to arbitrate with me if I don't like the quality of his work, right? He's not a signatory to our arbitration agreement.
Maybe he doesn't even know about it. But the fact that you and I think -- no, you're going to get him to do it, and we think we're going to arbitrate all our disputes, he's not bound to arbitrate? I think whether he could arbitrate would depend on the domestic doctrine about non-signatory enforcement.
And on the facts that you've posited, I think on an equitable estoppel theory, if you were to sue him, rather than me, for -- for claims that are intertwined with our contract, the contract that you and I have, under an equitable estoppel theory, he could be compelled to arbitrate. That was the same sort of factor -- I thought it was one of the central propositions of our arbitration precedents that arbitration is based on agreement.
And here somebody who did -- never agreed to arbitration is being forced into arbitration, even though he has a clear right to take his dispute to court. Arbitration is, of course, a matter of consent.
But as long as you and I have a valid arbitration agreement, that -- that's the key, consent.
Then the scope of that arbitration agreement is another question, and that's determined in the Chapter 1 context by domestic law. That was the situation the Court faced in Arthur Andersen, and the Court saw no inconsistency between Chapter 1 and an equitable estoppel theory.
There was no consent problem with what -- with remanding for the lower court in Arthur Andersen to consider whether the requirements of equitable estoppel were satisfied to allow a non-signatory to compel arbitration in a domestic context. Well, what if the -- The question -- What if the law of the jurisdiction whose law would be chosen permits arbitration without any consent whatsoever? I guess you'd have to say that that's -- that's okay, right? That -- the Convention doesn't prevent that.
That's simply not the problem that the Convention was trying on solve. The purpose of the Convention was to address the problem of under-enforcement of arbitration agreements.
If there is some country out there or some state that is compelling arbitration in the way that you're describing, the Convention doesn't directly deal with that, except perhaps in Article V, which would provide a public policy backstop for the country in which enforcement of an award is sought to say we're not enforcing that award because it contravenes our public policy. So you're saying that when the United States entered into the Convention and when it then implemented the Convention through the FAA, Congress didn't understand arbitration to mean voluntary arbitration? The, you know -- my -- my question I guess is the same as Justice Alito's. It seems odd that Congress would have passed the implementing legislation on the view that another contracting state could compel arbitration without any consent whatsoever. Justice Kagan, I think this goes to the core question of what the Convention is trying to do.
The Convention is trying to set forth minimum standards by which other countries will recognize and enforce arbitration agreements. And to be sure, the Convention does not require any country to recognize forced arbitration, so to speak.
The -- the premise of the Convention is that the floor, the minimum, that other countries are agreeing to do, is to recognize valid arbitration agreements. By the same token, it doesn't preempt all domestic laws, including theoretically -- although there's no evidence that this is a real problem -- the kind of forced arbitration that you're positing. In the situation that we have here and in the Chief Justice's hypothetical, there's no question of forced arbitration.
There is indisputably a valid arbitration agreement.
The only question is can domestic law supply non-signatory enforcement doctrines in order to allow, again, a non-signatory -- But you don't -- The fact is, you started out very broadly, and suddenly I get worried, are some people who -- the seller agrees that I'll go to arbitration, I agree with you, okay? Now, I don't want to go.
And it's not against you; it's against him.
I didn't agree to that or did I? Now, I thought this is quite narrow or could be.
What actually either seller did is I agreed, I signed a party and said I'll go to arbitration.
And -- but the -- when you use the word ""seller,"" which I think maybe was me; is that right, your opponent, that includes subcontractors in this contract. And, by the way, you're a subcontractor.
And you were listed.
So it isn't exactly involuntary.
Or you and I agree and I say: Our contract, including arbitration, is for the benefit of Mr. Johnson, who is a third-party beneficiary for everything including arbitration.
And then the question is: Can Mr. Johnson bring me in? He didn't sign it.
You signed it. Now, can't we decide it on a narrow ground like that by indeed leading up to the lower court all those questions about whether it's really true, whether it really isn't true that a third-party beneficiary can or the person listed in the seller's side can, and just say it doesn't limit it to where you're the one who wants to bring me into arbitration.
They're well established legal doctrines. I don't want to make my argument for you.
I want you to tell me quite straightforward -- and I'll -- in a few seconds, is that a possible argument in this case? We just send it back. Yes, Your Honor.
The -- the Eleventh Circuit held -- the Eleventh Circuit held that only the signatories to the arbitration agreement could enforce it. And -- Which is a fairly basic proposition of law.
So if we're going to send it back to say why don't you see if you can enforce arbitration against somebody who didn't sign the agreement, or who wasn't -- it's one thing to say, okay, your parent company or your subsidiary or whatever, and the fact that you might say or subcontractors, doesn't mean that any particular subcontractor wants to arbitrate. So you're going to send it back for -- I mean, if someone is going to adopt such a radical proposition it probably should be us, rather than send it back to the Eleventh Circuit and say, well, if you want to go against all -- all of our precedents in arbitration, fine, but we're not going to do it. So, Mr. Chief Justice -- Not to suggest I have a view either way. (Laughter.) I -- I don't think this is contrary to all of this Court's precedents on arbitration.
Just the opposite. In Arthur Andersen the Court remanded for the lower court to consider whether an equitable estoppel theory would allow a non-signatory to compel arbitration.
So that's -- Can you -- -- precisely -- Can you -- can we -- can we understand why Respondent should be equitably estopped? This case is going in the brief, and so far in the oral argument on a level once -- once removed from the basic facts on the ground. So what is it in this case that makes the doctrine of equitable estoppel appropriate? Let me make two points on that.
One is the point that I think Justice Breyer was making. On these particular facts, GE energy is defined under the contract as a party.
The term ""parties"" is defined to include buyer and seller, ""seller"" is defined to include subcontractor, and GE is listed in the contract as one of the subcontractors that the parties contemplated using. And so we are actually a party to the contract, even though we didn't put -- even though we didn't ink the contract with our signature.
In addition -- And -- and -- even though at the time the contract was made, the subcontractors hadn't been picked, so there were -- GE was on a list of potential subcontractors, but was not, in fact, a subcontractor at the time of the arbitration agreement? I don't believe that it had been picked, but there were active and extensive discussions, including with the Respondents, about using GE as a subcontractor, so it was certainly contemplated. And if you -- if you follow the definitions of seller and -- and -- buyer and seller and parties in the contract that GE is actually a party to the agreement.
As a -- on a more doctrinal level in terms of equitable estoppel, equitable estoppel is a way of inferring consent from conduct. And if the Respondents sue us, as they did in this case, on a theory that depends on the duty of care arising out of the contract, they are in essence suing us on the contracts. They can't cherry-pick to invoke the duty of care from the contract but to avoid their agreement to arbitrate disputes under that contract. That -- that would be the doctrinal basis for an equitable estoppel theory. Counsel -- And this -- -- we're going well down this rabbit hole on whether equitable estoppel applies in this case.
But I -- I had -- I had proceeded on maybe on the mistaken assumption that the question whether equitable estoppel is recognized as a viable theory under the Federal Arbitration Act isn't before us. The only question before us is whether anything in the convention precludes an argument like that to be made under the Federal Arbitration Act, whether or not it might succeed. Am I -- but I -- am I mistaken? No, that -- that's correct, Justice Gorsuch.
And I think that goes to Justice Breyer's point as well.
The actual question presented here is quite narrow.
And that is whether there is anything in the New York Convention that prohibits the application of equitable estoppel. If it exists, without prejudging whether it exists. Correct. Okay. And that -- much the same as the posture in Arthur Andersen where the Court sent the case back for the lower courts to determine whether equitable estoppel exists under the applicable law and, if so, whether it could be satisfied. But Mr. Dvoretzky, that -- that is the question.
So let's take a look at Article II, and specifically the third sentence because the third sentence says, ""The court of a contracting state"" -- and then I'm going to skip some words -- ""shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration."" And I have to tell you, I think that the best understanding of the term ""parties"" looking at the three sentences of Article II, let's just assume that the best understanding is the parties to the agreement. So this says the parties to the agreement are requesting the arbitration.
And that's when the court should refer the arbitration.
Now, that raises the question who's the party? I -- I'm with the Chief Justice.
If you're talking about an alter ego or something like that, or a successor-in-interest, maybe that person counts as a party, even though it is not the signatory but there is some limit, isn't there, that is imposed by that language of ""the parties""? Justice Kagan, I think the key point is that Article III does not say ""only the parties."" In other words, the bear minimum the contracting states agree to do is to refer a case to arbitration if the parties -- whether you think that's to be -- Well, let me read you a few sentences, Mr. Dvoretzky and you tell me whether you always have to say ""shall only"" if you say ""shall."" If I say federal courts shall have jurisdiction over federal questions, would this statute also permits those courts to exercise jurisdiction over state questions? No, and Justice Kagan, I -- I -- I'm going to give you one more just to prove the point. (Laughter.) Shareholders shall appoint two directors to the board.
Does that mean shareholders can appoint 20 directors to the board? No. Because ""shall"" means ""shall only"" in many circumstances, right? It -- it depends on context. It does. And the context here based on the purpose of the Convention, based on how this Convention has been nearly universally understood by contracting states, which is a key factor in this Court's treaty interpretation jurisprudence, is that this -- this provision, Article II(3), like the rest of the Convention, is just setting a floor on what contracting states agree to do. So at a minimum, they agree that they shall -- the courts shall refer cases to arbitration when requested by the parties, but not that they shall only do so.
You can of course come up with examples where ""shall"" does mean ""shall only,"" but it does -- it doesn't mean that here.
And -- Right.
So I guess that brings us back to the question that Justice Alito started us off with, because I think that that's relevant to the context in which we're viewing this Convention, which is the assumption on the part of the United States Congress when it passed the FAA and surely the -- those who entered into the Convention, the Convention was a matter of -- excuse me -- that arbitration was a matter of voluntary consent. I mean, so if it's a matter of voluntary consent, and everybody thinks that that's what arbitration is, shouldn't we read ""the parties"" to be, you know, the parties? Nobody else. And again I would take you back to Arthur Andersen.
Certainly under domestic law it is understood to be a matter of voluntary consent but the Court saw no issue with the possibility of an equitable estoppel theory that would allow a non-party to enforce. The Convention does not contain an independent consent requirement.
It just doesn't -- it just doesn't say that.
And it would be inconsistent with its purpose to have that because, again, the backdrop to the Convention was there was widespread mistrust of arbitration agreements.
Agreements were not being enforced. The Convention set out to remedy that problem and to provide for more enforcement of arbitration, not less than that. Counsel, we often -- But, moreover -- -- we often -- I'm sorry. Is it -- is it necessary to go so far as to say that the Convention says nothing about what the relevant law of a particular jurisdiction says about who can enforce an arbitration agreement or could it say -- could it perhaps go beyond strictly the signatories to the agreement and encompass some other non-parties that have a sufficient -- that have a close connection, as would be the case with somebody who was equitably estopped? If I may answer? Sure.
Sure. I think that's right and it's not just equitable estoppel.
There are a number of non-signatory doctrines including alter ego and veil piercing, for example, that the other side points to as valid under the Convention, even though those can't be thought of as consensual; just the opposite, an alter-ego theory and the veil-piercing theory are disregarding the consent of the parties and holding them to the agreement any way. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ellis. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The New York Convention place an important but limited role in the recognition of international arbitration agreements.
It requires contracting states to recognize and enforce those agreements in certain circumstances, but it does not, as my friend says, establish a comprehensive set of rules for arbitration. For two fundamental reasons, the Eleventh Circuit has wrong to read into the writing requirement of Article II a categorical prohibition on compelling international arbitration on the basis of estoppel principles. First, the Convention as a whole only ever requires contracting states to enforce arbitration agreements; it never prohibits them -- them from doing so. And, second, Article II, section 2, is a rule of presumptive validity.
It speaks to when a court must recognize an arbitration agreement as valid.
It does not speak to the scope of valid agreements, including who may be bound or who may invoke those agreements. Now, Respondents provide a series of alternative grounds for refusing to compel arbitration in this case, but there's no reason for this Court to pass on those grounds in the first instance. Just as the Court did in -- in Arthur Andersen for the FAA, the Court should make clear that the Convention does not categorically prohibit enforced -- Excuse me -- -- compelling arbitration on estoppel grounds. -- there are two ways to reach your result.
One is to read Article II and say what you seem to be saying, which is that it only requires or compels arbitration in one circumstance but a contracting state can compel arbitration in any way that it wants, even without a written agreement.
That seems to be the essence of your argument, correct? Yes. That's odd, indeed, because as Justice -- as the Chief Justice noted and Justice Kagan noted, it seems always that a signed written agreement respecting consent is a minimum requirement.
Or another way to get to where you want to go, another reading, is that Article II does not allow contracting states to compel arbitration whenever it wants, even without a written agreement but that they can compel it if someone is a party, that that's undefined. And that seems to be how most other contracting states have read this, which is that there's a lot of leeway for states to determine who's a party to that written agreement.
And they can do that through normal principles of privity or normal principles of contract interpretation, including alter ego and veil piercing and all the other things that your adversary accepts can be done. You don't need, as I think the circuit below wrongly required -- it seemed to say you need that party's signature on the agreement. That's right. So there's common ground, but I do think within that common ground, there has to be a limiting principle established somewhere.
And I don't think it can be that you can have an oral agreement or a state could say, with respect, no essence of consent whatsoever, that we're just going to let anybody -- if you signed an arbitration agreement about the manufacturer of this thing, equitable principles are always going to let anybody come in and sue -- and let -- Sure. -- let them be sued. Sure. So assuming we're on common ground or I am, that we have some, some basis to say that contracting states can pick who parties are, what's the limiting principle after that? What's the limiting principle of equitable estoppel? It can't be every single type of equitable estoppel is okay. Sure.
So -- so a couple points, Your Honor.
And I'm happy to -- And, by the way, on this case, it's easy to win. Right.
And we're happy to win on -- on either ground. And very -- on this case, no matter what the theory of equitable estoppel is, a seller who's defined within the contract to include suppliers that include GE, that seems like a fairly straightforward case to me. So -- so we haven't taken a position on -- on the ultimate resolution, but we agree -- and it sounds like you agree -- that the Eleventh Circuit's rule is just wrong, that it's not categorically limited to signatories. That's enough to resolve this case. Now, as for limiting principles, I think there are limiting principles.
I think there are two types to be -- to consider.
The first limiting principle is to consider when -- what's the limit on when a contracting state is required to compel arbitration? And I think there certainly are limits.
I think section -- Article II, section 3, is the relevant provision, not Article II, section 2.
And the question there says that the parties before the -- have to have made an agreement.
So I think the question, can you -- does the domestic law consider the parties to have made an agreement to this written agreement? Now, the -- the other limiting principle is -- is -- is whether states are then prohibited from, under their own -- under the domestic law, to recognize other types of arbitration agreements.
I -- I -- I just don't think the contract -- the Convention can be read to impose those limits.
That doesn't mean that you can then say -- enforce an -- require another state to enforce an oral arbitration agreement under the Convention.
It would not be clearly, not be under the Convention, but a -- but a -- a contracting state -- But that's going -- -- has not given up its right to enforce the -- -- much further afield than I think other contracting states have and it's reading Article VII into Article II, which to me is illogical. We don't think you have to read Article VII on its text to do that.
I will say that it's fairly uniform that -- that Article VII at least should inform the scope of Article II, the same sort of most favorable rules should apply to -- to enforcing arbitration agreements as a -- That -- that seems contrary to the very strict requirements that you need a written agreement between the parties. Absolutely, Your Honor. I think that's a very different argument than saying you have some play in the joints with respect to who parties are and that domestic law can inform that. I -- I -- and -- and I want to be clear.
The Convention does not apply to -- to arbitration agreements that are not written or that don't meet the presumptive -- the validity requirements in Article II at -- at least insofar as -- as -- there's this debate between whether Article II, Section 2, was exhaustive or non-exhaustive.
But either way, the Convention isn't going to apply and, therefore, isn't going to require the enforcement of agreement that doesn't meet the requirements of the Convention. But the Convention doesn't further then say that a -- a contracting state cannot enforce beyond that.
And -- and that's what you have -- Counsel -- -- to conclude -- Can -- can we go -- -- to support the Eleventh Circuit's rule. -- back to -- to a question Justice Kagan raised? There are these privity-like people and then there's this doctrine of equitable estoppel, which we're told that many of our treaty partners do not recognize.
So what you're suggesting is that we should recognize this equitable estoppel, even though our treaty partners would not, which could yield divergent results and give you a real problem at the enforcement end because a country that doesn't recognize equitable estoppel will hesitate to enforce an award that was based on that theory. So you -- you can distinguish these successors in interest, maybe assignors, privity-like people from this equitable estoppel, which is not universally embraced by our treaty partners. Yes, Your Honor.
That -- I mean, the Respondent has argued that estoppel, equitable estoppel, is an outlier.
I think that's a bit of an overstatement. I think that there are very comparable doctrines around the world that look a lot like U.S. equitable estoppel principles.
The Titan Unity decision from Singapore adopts U.S. estoppel principles by name, by citing to U.S. courts.
And then there is the venire contra factum proprium in civil law countries that look a lot like equitable estoppel. But that has been described as the -- the Latin phrase you just used, as akin to traditional estoppel as opposed to this equitable estoppel. Sure, that's fair enough. I guess the -- the overarching point is that nothing in the Convention draws the sort of line that Respondent is trying to do.
It can't be the party line that they've pointed to. I -- I don't know why traditional estoppel or venire contra factum proprium would more akin to a party than not.
It can't be the consent principle that they point to, for the reasons that my friend says.
Piercing the corporate veil is -- is -- is at least based on equity and fairness and then contrary to sort of formal express consent, as any equitable estoppel principle is. And so at the bottom, what you -- our view is that the -- the Convention simply doesn't speak to those principles and what other domestic law principles that apply. Counsel -- Before your time runs out, I'd like you to answer specifically, in the Public Citizens' brief, they cite a case called Todd v. Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association.
They say a U.S. worker who was injured by his employer in Louisiana sued that insolvent insurer's -- employer's insurer under Louisiana's Direct Action Statute, and was required to arbitrate his personal injury claim before an arbitration panel in London. That sounds like a real horrible -- is -- is that the result of the position that you are pressing? So I -- I apologize.
I'm not familiar with the facts of that particular case and exactly how they got to that result.
I -- I -- I will say that there are, I think the Convention itself does not limit contracting states from enforcing arbitration.
There may be other limits.
There may be other limits in the FAA itself that don't need to -- the court below didn't reach and this Court doesn't need to get into. Justice Gorsuch has a question. Counsel, I'm -- I understand that different countries may have different views about equitable estoppel or other kinds of non-signatory, non-strict consent arbitrations. Is there any disagreement among countries about how to read the Convention itself with respect to whether it creates a floor or a ceiling? Not that I'm aware of. The only -- at least not of any -- any significance.
The only one that I'm aware of is this Javor decision from the British Columbia courts that reads Article II, Section 2 in the way the Eleventh Circuit does, but we have cited cases from Germany, France, and Switzerland on 26 to 28 of our brief.
The Bremen brief has collected cases from 21 to 30 of their brief. The UNCITRAL recommendation is -- is inconsistent with Eleventh Circuit's decision. That represents the views of about 60 different countries.
The model -- the implementing legislation from Peru, from Singapore, from Australia, are -- are contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's view of the Convention, and even the Javor case from British Columbia has not been followed by subsequent British Columbia courts and it has been criticized. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hacker. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: GE cannot compel Outokumpu to arbitrate its tort claim with GE because there is no written arbitration agreement between them. I agree that would generally not be an obstacle in a domestic arbitration case because, as this Court held in Arthur Andersen, Chapter 1's agreement enforcement provision, FAA Section 3, does not limit enforcement to ""parties to a written agreement."" But the lack of a written agreement is decisive here because the Convention's enforcement provision, Article II, Section 3, is limited to the parties to a written arbitration agreement.
Because that provision controls over Chapter 1's conflicting enforcement provision, non-parties cannot enforce agreements in cases under the Convention.
That rule is subject to two important corollaries that have already been discussed this morning. First, the Convention does not prohibit contracting states from enacting other domestic laws that can mandate international arbitration on other terms, including oral agreements or absent consent.
But as the commentators agree, and as the United States agreed this morning, arbitrations under such statutes do not proceed under the Convention, meaning that the resulting awards will not receive the benefit of the Convention and its near automatic enforcement provisions, as Justice Ginsburg warned. That kind of distinct extra Convention statute is not at issue in this case, because the United States has not enacted one.
Chapter 2 instead makes the Convention itself controlling in all international arbitration cases.
Chapter 1 applies only where the Convention does not supply a different rule, such as FAA Section 6 and 7 which govern motions and witnesses. The Convention, however, does provide its own rule for enforcing arbitration agreements and, therefore, that rule controls. The second corollary also discussed is that enforcement by a party under the Convention includes its privities, under principles well-known to and even discussed by the Convention drafters. Those principles differ categorically from the broad modern estoppel doctrines that GE is trying to invoke here. Mr. Hacker, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I did want to spin back a little bit.
Did I understand you to say as a matter of domestic law you would agree that -- that this contract could be enforced by GE under equitable estoppel or did I mishear you? I -- I hope you misheard me. Okay. I definitely did not -- did not believe this contract can be enforced by GE.
The arbitration clause cannot be enforced by GE because GE is not a party to the contract and is not a party to the arbitration clause. And this goes to Justice Breyer's question, I think, about the sort of more narrow ground. I thought you said at the first part Arthur Andersen and, yes, there would be a real question here but it's -- there's no real question here because of the Convention. That's -- in a domestic arbitration case Arthur Andersen would -- would control and you'd ask whether the controlling state law allowed for equitable estoppel. Okay. This is not a domestic arbitration. Okay.
So under domestic arbitration rules, there would be a real live question here? You'd look to do -- applicable state law, there's no applicable state law here, it's German law and you would have to determine whether or not equitable estoppel applied here.
This case is governed by the Convention which it supplies its own rule -- But -- but for the Convention, despite the international character of this agreement, we would have a choice of law problem undoubtedly but we'd find some choice of law, look and see whether equitable estoppel is a permissible argument to be made in an arbitration case like this? In a domestic case, that's correct.
This is a Convention case -- If it weren't governed by the Convention, but for the Convention -- Right. -- it would be a choice of law problem? Yes. Okay. That would be the first question, choice of law.
The second question would be whether the law authorizes.
This is a Convention case -- Would this be a question under regular estoppel rules? Forget about equitable estoppel.
Would they have a potential claim under estoppel rules? No. Why not? Because traditional -- They are defined as sellers in the contract.
Why wouldn't estoppel rules, not equitable rules, but mere estoppel rules make them a seller? All right.
So -- You signed a contract.
You agreed to arbitrate with the sellers.
Sellers were defined as a list of sub -- subcontractors or sub-suppliers.
They -- they were among those.
Why wouldn't estoppel stop you, normal estoppel rules? If I can separate that out.
Two questions.
First of all, they are not a party to that arbitration clause.
And when I show you why they're not a party to the arbitration clause, that's going to answer the question why -- Why? -- they're not a party to the arbitration clause, because as we know, under international law, arbitration clauses are separable from the rest of the contract.
You don't look to the contract generally to determine who is a party to the arbitration clause; you have to look to the clause itself. Look at -- start with common sense about what's going on in that contract.
If subcontractors are defined for all purposes and defined for purposes of the arbitration clause, as parties to the arbitration clause, it's a bilateral agreement.
Right? You've got a thousand subcontractors on site including local dry-wallers, paint suppliers, maintenance guys. If all of them are agreeing implicitly -- When seller -- I'm reading the contract.
When ""seller"" is mentioned, it shall be understood as subcontractors, and a million or not, included, except if expressly stated otherwise. Where in the arbitration clause are they expressly stated otherwise? They're not stated otherwise in the arbitration clause, except that the arbitration clause is separable.
And remember, Your Honor, remember, this is so important, Your Honor -- So what? Because -- Who are the parties -- where does it say that subcontractors are not sellers for purposes of the arbitration clause? It doesn't say it in the arbitration clause but we know, we know, Your Honor, that ""seller"" doesn't actually mean subcontractor everywhere in the contract.
The next paragraph, literally after the one you're quoting, says that the seller has to construct the whole mill.
That can't be all the subcontractors. Article 6 of the agreement says that the seller receives all kinds of payments from Outokumpu.
We know that not all the -- I know -- -- subcontractors receive -- I understand -- -- all the payments. -- these are good arguments, but it -- it seems to me that it's one thing to say we're going to force all these suppliers into arbitration, compel them without their consent.
That -- that would be -- that would be one -- one thing. But it's quite another to say that you -- you agree -- you agreed to this contract, where they can -- they can bring arbitration against you.
And there's no consent problem there, it seems to me. You've -- you've consented -- this is the scope of your consent, we have to address, but the idea that you consented to something seems hard to dispute, isn't it, as a matter of domestic law? I -- Well, I -- I think that's Justice Sotomayor's point. -- let me -- first of all, domestic law -- domestic law is not at issue here.
It's the Convention which requires a written agreement between the parties to arbitrate.
So the question is where is the written agreement between us and GE and the local paint guy to arbitrate claims between us? Here is where.
And I -- to do this, I want your reaction. A. James Casner, who was my property professor, and a great man would also often use the word -- if we look at the sentence 3 of Article II, of course that word ""parties"" does not mean the parties in court.
It means the parties who sign the agreement. And what the third says is that the court shall, at the request of one of the parties, emphasize, refer the matter to arbitration. But you, yourself, say sometimes a person who is not a party can force you to go to arbitration.
That person you call a privity, a word full of obscurity. (Laughter.) So the words that he used are not privity.
He would say in a thing like this, it's one of the parties or someone who stands in the shoes of a regular party, of -- of an ordinary party. Now most of what you say is consistent with that.
And if you use those vaguer words, you pick up what we said in Andersen because sometimes such a person who is a non-signatory would stand in the shoes because of assumption of a contract, because it went through bankruptcy, because we pierced the corporate veil, because there's theory of alter ego, because there's an incorporation by reference, third-party beneficiary theories, waiver, and, he says, estoppel. So it sounds what we're really arguing about is this the kind of estoppel and are these the circumstances of estoppel that will put your adversary in the shoes of a party? If I am right -- and you're nodding your head, which is a good sign -- Nodding only that I understand your question. Oh, okay. (Laughter.) I don't think I'm going to agree with where you're heading. Then you can say -- all right.
Then you can say it's not right. But I -- I -- I thought that that's a question which I don't know the answer to and that, really, the Eleventh Circuit didn't use this wonderful expression, ""stand in the shoes of"" and thereby pick up the Arthur Andersen or at least some of them. Since they didn't, we could send it back and say the district court seemed to think they should, but here they're making an excellent argument on both sides.
Now, now you've got my question.
It's what to do with this case, depends on an assumption.
What do you think? So the answer is I don't think ""stand in the shoes"" is any more clear than -- Oh, no, it isn't but it doesn't purport to be. (Laughter.) Right.
Privity -- privity explains all -- almost all of the situations in you -- which you need to be concerned about whether or not a non-party, non-signatory, by which I mean somebody who's not literally named, actually is standing in the shoes of a signatory.
That explains almost all of the international cases that don't involve traditional estoppel. What do we -- And that is a very easy and clear line. What do we have to decide? The -- the Eleventh Circuit said a non-signatory can never enforce, right? Not quite, no. It said a non-signatory cannot enforce. It -- it said non-signatories include their privities.
It said it twice, and so we know from the Eleventh Circuit's rule that that includes privities. And so this Court could be clearer about that, but the Eleventh Circuit was absolutely correct. It also emphasized the importance of a signature, which may look like an overstatement because we know Article II includes documents exchanged, letters, and telegrams.
But, of course, the Eleventh Circuit was only talking about a signature because GE was not pointing to any sort of separate document exchanged in a letter or telegram. The question was whether there was a written agreement or they were -- they should have been whether they were privity with a -- Well, How does this -- -- party to the agreement. How does this concept of privity, which is, as far as I'm -- as far as I'm aware, is a feature of Anglo-American law, become the -- become the controlling standard under this international agreement? Well, I -- it's not limited to Anglo-American law.
There are different types of privity doctrines recognized throughout the world. Okay, well, what's the doctrine of privity under German law? I -- I don't know what the German word is, but I'm sure it's extremely long. (Laughter.) But it's going to mean some version of the same thing. What is it under Japanese law? The question -- the question being asked under whatever, you know, privity rules you're invoking are, is this party the same party for some reason as a signatory? That's not the question that is raised by the equitable estoppel claim that GE is raising. It's a fundamentally different question about -- I agree, I am not a signatory, I am not in privity with a signatory; I just want to make them enforce -- make them arbitrate with me because... because it's more convenient to, it seems efficient, it seems fair, whatever rules, you know, the local jurisdiction might invoke. They want to say those local rules, the equitable, fairness, justice principles of a given state, can trump what the Convention says, at least in a Convention-governed arbitration, the Convention says it's supposed to be a written agreement between the parties. I think -- I think the argument on the other side would be that -- that equitable estoppel or estoppel, whatever you want to -- however you want to describe it here, is -- is -- is that your client effectively did consent.
That's the way in which it would be rephrased to -- I -- I understand. So -- so what do you do about -- do about that, Number 1? And Number 2, in a completely different line -- and take them as you choose, okay -- normally when we interpret treaties to bind domestic law, we require a pretty clear statement when -- when we're staying Congress's hand in an area. And if the FAA, hypothetically -- and I'm not passing on it; we don't need to -- were to allow equitable estoppel doctrine and the Convention didn't allow domestic law to do that, wouldn't we require a clearer statement than what we have here? Let me answer the first question, which I think I'll actually answer by the Convention.
The Convention rule is not effectively consent.
That's not the principle of -- the Convention adopts and requires for Convention-governed agreements.
It requires a written agreement between the parties who are -- and it requires a court to enforce an agreement between the parties.
It has to be the -- the -- the parties to the agreement are the only parties that could obtain enforcement under the Convention. So I think that's the clear answer. Except for the fact -- except for -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
Except for the fact that you've admitted that there are other doctrines that allow third parties to be brought in as privities -- Because they're -- -- who may not have strictly consented.
Alter-ego theory, veil-piercing theory.
It's -- it's a fiction to call that consent. I disagree, Your Honor, because what -- what you have is a consent -- a written agreement between parties.
And the counterparty in that situation is agreeing to arbitrate with, you know, Fives.
Whoever Fives is defined as, they're arbitrating with Fives and whoever stands in Fives' shoes.
That is a fundamentally -- there's consent there, there's a written agreement there, and the doctrines that international law recognizes for determining who properly stands in Fives' shoes. There is no universally recognized doctrine of international law that allows somebody who is not Fives in any sense to come in and say: Even though you never agreed to arbitrate with me, you're suing me -- and let's be clear about this -- you're suing me in tort outside the contract.
These are not claims that are based on a -- the contractual duty between Outokumpu and Fives.
These are tort claims governed by Alabama tort standards, and you never agreed with me in a written agreement to arbitrate those kinds of claims.
Nevertheless, I'm going so say that, you know, I -- I think it's fairer for me to do that.
I want to invoke your agreement. Mr. Hacker, sorry -- Please. Did you -- No, go ahead. Your argument here does rest on reading Article II and especially sentence 3 as not just a floor; as a -- as a -- as a ceiling -- as a floor and a ceiling, both. That's correct. So where do you get that understanding from? Because Mr. Dvoretzky, the solicitor general, says the parties to the Convention were just concerned about people not enforcing arbitration agreements.
They didn't have it in mind to draw up a whole set of rules about when to and when not to. That's left up to the states.
What -- what -- what's your best argument to the contrary? So a couple points.
Let me start with the text in where I think the United States agrees with us, which is the Convention does make it a ceiling that you have to have a written agreement.
That's required. You can't proceed under the Convention absent a written agreement. That comes out of Article II(1), which says the contracting states shall recognize a written agreement.
It's the same language then in Article II(3).
""The court seized of an action shall"" -- ""shall, at request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration."" It all fits together with Article II. Those are all mandatory requirements in order to trigger the protections of the Convention. What -- why is it so clear that the first one is a mandatory requirement? Well, the United States concedes it.
And it -- they're right to do that for the reason you say, Your Honor, ""shall"" sometimes is a -- a mandatory requirement.
The examples you gave are good ones.
The United States Constitution says the -- the legislative power shall be vested in a Congress.
Nobody thinks that means it could be elsewhere. Right.
So I think everybody agrees the question is context. Correct. And what in the context do you think indicates that this is a ceiling? Because it's what's required to trigger the protections of -- the requirements of Article IV and Article V for enforcement. But counsel -- You have to have an agreement under Article -- -- that -- that -- that's a non sequitur.
I think what Justice Kagan is trying to get at, and what I would like to get at, is, fine, that may be what's required to trigger the Convention, but that may just be the floor of -- of what's available to states domestically, and domestically they may choose to enforce more than that. Yes.
I -- I agree with that. I think that's the question Justice Kagan is asking, and if you could address that. I -- I meant to be answering within the confines of the Convention, because that's all it takes here. Forget about within the context of the Convention. Right. Is there a universe of arbitration agreements that a domestic law might enforce that might not be enforceable under the Convention? Yes.
Yes, that's Arthur Andersen.
Those -- that definitely says that -- Here -- I'm sorry, I'm -- I'm sorry, and I apologize.
Isn't that the end of the case? If there are some universe of agreements that could be only domestically enforceable but are not enforceable under the Convention, then what? Because they can't proceed under the Convention -- under domestic law under U.S. law.
Chapter 2 makes international arbitration -- the Convention the sole source of law governing international arbitration agreements.
You cannot proceed under Chapter 1, for example, and get enforcement of an arbitration agreement overseas. Chapter 2 is the only place you can go.
And Chapter 2 says the Convention proscribes the controlling law, you know, unless Chapter 1 -- so long as it is conflicting.
And we know that the Convention is conflicting with Chapter 1 because the Convention proscribes, requires for Convention-governed agreements, a written agreement, that can be enforced only by the parties to the written agreement.
It differs from Chapter 1 in that respect. Can you tell us what is -- There is no Chapter 1 here that -- Can you tell us what is going on in this -- in this very case? The party that you call Fives has to arbitrate, there is a written agreement, and there is an arbitration in Berlin; is that right, going on? Dusseldorf. I see.
But then there is also this proceeding in the Alabama Supreme -- in Alabama state trial court.
And is that proceeding going forward? Yes. So you have two cases, which in the best of all possible worlds because they're linked would be heard in the same forum, one going to an arbitration panel in Berlin and the other going to the state court in Alabama, but that's the result of your view of what the Convention requires? Well, if -- if -- if we had prevailed and didn't get before this Court, we would just be proceeding in Alabama as we should be.
There is jurisdiction -- I mean, this Court has jurisdiction to resolve the certiorari question before it. But in our view, this case should be in Alabama state court on the tort claims that we have asserted. What I mean is that the relationship between the subcontractor and the contractor, vis-a-vis the buyer, that -- that litigation ideally would be all one case; instead we have this split. Well, again, it might be. We had an action against Fives, decided not to pursue it because Fives from the very outset said it's not our problem, they supplied the motors, they were the problem, GE screwed up. GE will take care of it, don't talk to us, we pursued it for a while with Fives.
GE did begin working with us to fix the motors and provide housing for the motors.
We basically had an ongoing working relationship with GE after a time, and it turned out not to be satisfactory. The problems were not solved.
And their defective motors caused additional damage to our facility which under Alabama law and, by the way, U.S. federal common law in the maritime context allows a party to assert a tort claim outside the contractual relationship. I'm interested in -- you want to read that sentence 3 as the ceiling. You know what I am talking about? The Article II -- Yeah, Article II -- -- paragraph 3. -- sentence 3 as a ceiling.
All right. Well -- the whole -- Yeah, but then the word ""privity"" doesn't appear there, you know, so you say almost a ceiling.
No.
Almost a party.
No.
Party plus privity.
And I say: Well, now, I'm sitting here, can I think of some cases that are hard to squeeze into the term ""privity"" but it sounds as if they should be able to stand in the shoes of the party? Smith makes a contract with Jones.
He says: You know, Jones, this is for the benefit of my daughter when she's 35.
This will help her a lot.
And I want her to be able to enforce it. And I want her to be able to go to arbitration.
I love arbitration.
Jones writes back to the letter: I agree with you, of course you can enforce it in arbitration.
I love arbitration too. (Laughter.) Don't worry.
Go ahead and sign.
So he signs.
And now the daughter wants to go to arbitration after she's 35.
Well, that's a pretty strong case for estoppel. And it's very hard to call the daughter a privity.
So I've tried to think of a case where, does that sentence forbid that? No. Because you can't either call the daughter a privity, which sounds like a stretch, or you could say that is not a ceiling but it does pick up domestic law on this matter.
And, by and large, when the domestic law allows a non-signatory to enforce an arbitration clause against a signatory, this doesn't forbid it. Now, what about that approach? I think the problem is what you -- what was described earlier as a choice-of-law problem, which I think your international commentators recognize that the law has to be governed by universally recognized international law principles because if you open up the door to domestic law on what seems like a, gee, that seems an eminently fair situation and say domestic law gets to decide who gets to enforce, that creates a huge problem under the Convention because then states can begin subjecting parties to arbitration, absent their consent, unwilling parties when the Convention clearly intends to be -- All right. -- required to -- He had a list about a thousand miles long, it seemed to me, of authorities, cases, professors, and others who say all these other people have enforced that particular sentence in a way that it allows at least some, perhaps not all, of those who are hard to call privities to enforce under certain circumstances and this is one.
What do you say? The circumstance in which it is widely and I would say essentially universally recognized is only one.
It's not the one Your Honor describes.
It is the situation where a party begins or has even completed arbitration and then -- or an entity begins or completes arbitration and then later says I wasn't a party, I don't want to be subject to the results of this arbitration. That's a situation where courts, international decisions have recognized they can be held to it but it is not really an estoppel/contract doctrine.
What Justice Alito's opinion in the case in Minmetals described it as is really a waiver doctrine or forfeiture doctrine. That's how the English Court in Peterson Farms described it, that's how the UK High Court in Dallah described it.
It's really forfeiture or waiver.
It's not some opening the door to all kinds of situations when it sort of seems fair to let an unwilling party to force an unwilling party to arbitrate. And think about the consequences of doing that.
The Todd case that I believe Justice Ginsburg raised exemplifies the problems that you have if you just say -- if -- if it's connected to the contract in some way. Remember we had the earlier discussion from the earlier argument, the word ""involves"" can, you know, extend to the -- the limits of the universe.
Well, so can something that's related to the -- you know, to a contract can extend to no limit. And that's what happened in the Todd case where a sailor was injured while working on a ship, couldn't recover against his immediate employer because the employer went bankrupt or in some way couldn't -- wouldn't pay the employer for his personal injuries.
And so he went against the employer's principal, the guarantor, and the guarantor said: Well, your claim for injury on a ship is connected to this contract I have with the -- the -- the ship owner.
And that contract has an arbitration agreement. And so you have to arbitrate with me overseas over your personal injury. That's exactly the problem with opening the door to U.S. modern equitable estoppel that is divorced from the contract terms and divorced from a situation when you're really talking about a waiver where somebody has engaged in arbitration. That's the limited circumstance.
It's not any kind of gerrymander.
It's simply adhering to the same text of the Convention, which for Convention-governed cases requires a written agreement and limits enforcement of the written agreement to the parties to the agreement. Let me make one other point about the language of Article II, paragraph 3.
Justice Kagan's absolutely correct that ""parties,"" the second use of ""parties,"" pretty clearly is referring to the parties to the agreement.
If there is any doubt about that, look at the Spanish versions of the Convention, look at the French versions of the Convention, which you'll find at paragraphs or pages 11A and 20A of our brief. It actually says ""of them."" It doesn't say ""of the parties."" It says ""of them,"" immediately referring back to the parties to the written agreement. So there is really no ambiguity whatsoever there.
This, unlike FAA Section 3 addressed in Andersen limits enforcement to the parties to the written agreement. That's only in Convention-governing cases, Justice Gorsuch.
The point is it's possible for a state to adopt a separate law, like Peru did, and subject parties to arbitration, unwilling parties to arbitration on whatever terms a state feels like. That's not what the United States has done.
And the consequence of doing that is that you lose the automatic enforcement benefits, virtually automatic enforcement benefits promised by Article V. The last two points that I would make are recall that extension to non-parties, all the commentators, I think the United States too, says the extension of an arbitration agreement to non-parties is supposed to be rare.
It's supposed to be the exception that you almost never see. Under the doctrine GE wants you to adopt under U.S. law or under international law, essentially all subcontractors would suddenly be able to arbitrate, even absent a written agreement with the subcontractor because basically a claim between the subcontractor and the principle is in some way going to be connected to -- to involve the contract. So you completely erase the idea that this kind of enforcement is supposed to be rare, supposed to be -- be the exception, essentially be the rule in all construction cases. The other point I would remind the Court about its own decision in the Scherk case. It says the purpose of the Convention is to ""unify the standards"" for recognizing agreements and enforcing awards.
I submit, Your Honors, there is only one way to make the standards uniform and that is to respect, adhere to, and enforce the uniform textual words of the Convention. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Dvoretzky. Thank you.
If I could, let me make three points and then suggest possible ways to resolve this case. First, there's an international consensus in favor of non-signatory enforcement generally.
And there are numerous international cases that allow non-signatory enforcement on facts like these. The Titan Unity case from Singapore, there are cases from France and Switzerland, all of these are very similar.
You have a situation where A contracts with B and C actually performs the contract.
And in those situations because C is involved in performing A and B's contract, C can enforce the arbitration agreement if sued by one of the parties to the contract. So Singapore, France, Switzerland and other case -- cases cited in the briefs. Justice Sotomayor, you were looking for a limiting principle.
I think there are limiting principles to equitable estoppel under domestic law but the Convention just doesn't speak to them. Third, Mr. Hacker argues that Congress in effect adopts -- I'm sorry? What are they? It would depend on the contours of state law, but presumably state law would not allow you to tag a random person on the street with no connection to the contract and say you're equitably estopped.
There has to be a factual basis for the estoppel.
And here there is for the reasons that we have been discussing. Mr. Hacker argues that Congress adopted the Convention as both a floor and a ceiling for U.S. law.
That's simply not what Congress did in Chapter 2. It created federal jurisdiction where the agreement falls under the Convention, and then under 9 U.S.C. 206, if you have an agreement that falls under the Convention, a federal court exercising its jurisdiction can compel arbitration. It would do so by looking to domestic principles about when enforcement is proper. So in terms of how this case can be resolved, there's -- the narrowest possible way, is to simply hold that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to -- to apply a signatory requirement, at Petition Appendix 15A to 16A, the Eleventh Circuit recounts the district court's finding that we were parties but says the reason we can't enforce is that we didn't actually sign. I think that's demonstrably wrong and the narrowest possible way is to send it back for that reason.
If the Court wants to provide additional guidance, there are two ways to do that, I think.
One is to hold that the Convention provides a floor, not a ceiling.
I think that that follows from the text of the Convention, and also from international understanding. The second? The second way to resolve it, as Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, the term parties in Article II(3) is undefined. Domestic law fills that gap, as it does for many other things under the Convention, terms like ""null and void,"" ""incapable of being performed."" Those are not defined by the Convention but the Convention looks to domestic law, as it does for parties. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1150, Georgia versus Public.Resource.Org, Inc. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eleventh Circuit held that annotations to Georgia's official code are categorically ineligible for copyright protection.
That holding conflicts with a straightforward application of the Copyright Act's text and this Court's precedents. Starting with the statute, Sections 101 and 103 of the Act expressly provide that annotations are copyrightable derivative works. Nothing in the Act supports stripping Georgia's annotations of copyright protection merely because they were prepared by a contractor on behalf of a state agency. Therefore, the crux of the parties' dispute is whether this Court's 19th-century precedents support a decision different from the one that would be reached by applying standard interpretive principles to the Copyright Act's plain text.
They do not. In fact, those decisions strongly favor Georgia.
Together, they hold that while judicial opinions are not copyrightable, annotations added to opinions by a court's official reporter are copyrightable works of authorship. Similarly, while statutory text is not copyrightable, annotated research references are eligible for copyright protection, even if they appear in an official code book like the OCGA. As a diverse coalition of states has explained, affirming the decision below would scuttle numerous states' regimes for publishing annotated official codes.
Absent direction from Congress, this Court should not extend a judge-made doctrine to override the systems established by numerous states' democratically elected governments. I invite questions.
But as a diverse -- so PRO's case rests heavily on an expansive interpretation of just a few sentences of this Court's 1888 Banks decision.
But the Banks case really just explained its rationale in a single sentence, and that sentence says that the whole work done by the judges constitutes the authentic exposition and interpretation of the law, which is binding on every citizen and is thus free for publication to all. So we read that sentence as establishing the principle that a work is not copyrightable if it is of a type that can serve as a vehicle for establishing binding law. What do you understand the significance to be of the fact that these annotations, the references are official? I -- Does that -- does that give them more weight when they're cited to the court? No.
And I think that the thing that's official is the code.
So it's the Official Code of Georgia. Whether the -- the -- whatever the additional material is included in -- It does appear in the same publication.
That's correct.
And I don't think that that makes a difference for purposes of copyright under this Court's precedent. And I think that that's clear from Wheaton and Callaghan.
So, in both of those cases, the Court said that a court-appointed official reporter could hold copyright in annotations that appeared in the reporter volumes.
So this case is really just the legislative analogue of Callaghan. In Callaghan, the Court held that the official reporter could hold copyright in things like headnotes at the top of a decision.
And if you look at the judicial decision summaries in the OCGA, they are materially indistinguishable from those headnotes -- This case -- Except -- go ahead. But why isn't -- why isn't the legislature like the judge? The -- the judge puts his imprimatur on the annotations not copyrightable of the syllabus. And, here, it's the state legislature.
Why do you treat the judge and the state legislature differently? Well, I think it's different because the general assembly is not enacting individual annotations through bicameralism and presentment.
So the annotations are first prepared by a commercial publisher, so by a contractor, and they do that subject to the supervision of the Code Revision Commission. But they do it as -- as a -- what do they call it, authors for hire.
So the one that would hold the copyright would be the state. The state does hold the copyright, that is correct, very much like how an official reporter held the copyright in Wheaton and Callaghan.
So, here, the Code Revision Commission, acting on behalf of the state, obtains a copyright for the state. But I think the crucial point under Banks is that the annotations are not individually reviewed by legislators.
They do not go through the process of bicameralism and presentment.
So -- Well, but, counsel, aren't they approved? I thought they were at least approved as a whole by the legislature. So I think the Eleventh Circuit's decision is perhaps a little confusing on this issue, but I don't think that there's any disagreement about the underlying facts. The answer is, as the Eleventh Circuit said in its opinion, the annotations are not individually enacted. I -- I understand that.
I -- I posited that in my question to you. Right, right. Aren't they approved as a whole by the legislature? So what the legislature does every year is passes a reviser act, and the reviser act reenacts the code, including OCGA 1-1-1, which calls for the statutory text to be merged with the annotations. Okay.
All right. So, if that's the case, and you include the word ""official"" on it, presumably, you're doing that to create some value for the reporter. Why would we allow the official law enacted by a legislature, approved -- equivalent of being approved by a judge in annotations, as Justice Ginsburg indicated, why would we allow the official law to be hidden behind a pay wall? So I don't think that adopting our position would cause the official law to be hidden behind a pay wall.
First, the law is available on Lexis's website.
And also, PRO is free to cut -- But not the official annotations that the legislature has, in some fashion or another, given its official approval to. The annotations are not the law.
So the law is not behind a pay wall. Also, the annotations are available -- You're not arguing that it's purely -- I thought you had disavowed the argument that it's only things that bind for which copyright's unavailable. So our position is that if a work is of a type that, as a class, can serve as a vehicle for establishing binding law like judicial opinions -- And -- and aren't annotations in that category? Aren't they frequently used by state courts as indications of the legislature's intentions? No, not the type of annotations that we're talking about here. We're talking about traditional annotations that are research references or finding aids. They're things like, to give an example from JA 699, one of the annotations that we're claiming copyright in, says for a survey article on trial practice and procedure, see a particular law review. So you're disavowing that they're ever used by state courts as indications of legislative intent? That never happens? They are -- That's the representation you're making to this Court? The annotations would never be used as an indication of legislative intent like you would cite legislative history material. There are -- Why does Georgia -- No, go ahead.
Does that apply to all of the annotations in the official code? Does it apply to annotations made by the Georgia Bar? So the -- it applies to all the annotations we're claiming copyright in. The Georgia Bar, I think of those as comments, not necessarily annotations. They're provided by the Georgia Bar Committee to the Code Revision Commission.
The bar committees ask that they be included in the code.
And, often, the people who write them are involved in actually drafting the statutes. Georgia courts do cite those comments, but we are not claiming copyright in those annotations.
PRO is free to copy them.
And, in fact, they appear in West's unannotated -- What is the -- -- or unofficial annotated code. -- what is the -- what is the theory that distinguishes those annotations from the other annotations? I -- well, I think that, first of all, the author is different.
So it's the state bar.
The state bar, if it wanted to make a copyright claim, would have to be the one that's making the copyright claim. I don't think that -- I think probably those would not be copyrightable if the state bar was trying to make a copyright claim. Why? I -- I -- now I think there could be maybe a debate or dispute about this, but I think that they probably would not be copyrightable because they are offered for the purpose of providing a gloss on the text, the drafter's intent for the statutory text in some cases.
And courts in Georgia have treated them as such. Why would the Georgia Bar have particular insight into the intent of the legislature in enacting a provision of law? Well, often -- my understanding from reading the introductory text to these comments is that they're often drafted by people who were involved in drafting the legislation.
So, even though a bar committee member isn't in the legislature, they're often involved in assisting with the drafting of the legislation. Now perhaps -- But a lot of people could be involved in -- in -- in the drafting of legislation.
It could have been proposed by some interest group, it could have been something that was worked on by a law professor. So what distinguishes -- those could -- those would be copyrightable, shouldn't -- wouldn't they be if they -- somebody like that wrote an article? So what distinguishes them from the comments of the Georgia Bar? So I think it's perhaps different because the Georgia Bar has specifically asked for these comments to be included in the OCGA and Georgia courts have treated them as having some authoritative weight. So I think that that's what makes it different.
But I want to stress that the comments are not at issue in this case.
So I'm just trying to give my best views about whether those are -- I -- I'm sorry -- -- copyrightable or not. -- I didn't actually in reading this brief understand that. And I'm not sure the court below did because they relied on the comments as one of the reasons for why this was attributable to the state, for the very reasons you're giving, that the state asked for them, that the state commission who prepares them is involved generally in the drafting of the law. And so I don't think they separated out that the only thing you were seeking copyright protection for is the research comments and the -- what -- tell me exactly which part of the annotations you're seeking. It's the materials listed at JA 496 to 497.
And I -- I can march through those -- No, no. -- if it would be helpful.
But -- That's all right. But I do have a question.
If I read Wheaton, Wheaton says anything prepared by the judge can't be copyrighted.
That includes headnotes, which are comparable, I think, to summaries that might be included in these annotations because it's prepared by the judge. It remands to see if Wheaton was not an independent contractor and -- was an independent contractor and actually sought the copyright. Banks says, if -- if you are a separate entity, you can do this, but this is a work-for-hire. And I go back to what Justice Gorsuch was asking you.
The state is the one who's requiring this to be done.
It reviews it.
It approves it.
It is setting it out there as a merged document with the actual laws. It may have -- merger doesn't mean it's actual law, but neither are headnotes actual law.
Dicta is not actual law.
And no one's arguing -- you're not arguing under Banks or any of the other cases that the state couldn't put a copyright in headnotes it prepares or in the dicta in its judicial opinions. So why isn't authorship really the most important factor? I think we -- And if it's going to explain the law, either by reference to comments or by reference to cases that reflect its intent, isn't that an explanation, an official explanation of the law? So I think we win if authorship is the standard.
And I think that that's basically the United States' test.
And the United States agrees that we win under that standard. And on the question of what are the -- No, it doesn't, because it sort of limits it.
It thinks that it's not official in some sort of unofficial way.
Even though it's approved by the legislature, it's -- it's merged by its very terms.
It's a contract-for-hire, which means you treat it like an employee. If a law clerk prepares my headnotes or my summaries, I don't think I can get a copy -- he or she can get a copyright in it.
I don't think I can get a copyright in it even as a work-for-hire. Well, I -- I think that the answer can't be that the fact that this is an official document makes a difference for copyright purposes under Wheaton and Callaghan. Again, those were official reporters. And if the officialness of the document renders it uncopyrightable, then almost -- I mean, all state government documents in some way are official.
They come from the state government.
But the one thing that we know is that Congress made the policy determination to allow state governments to have copyright. And it's important to emphasize that Congress did this with a 1959 study and 1961 report in front of it saying that annotations by state government employees are copyrightable under current law. Mr. Johnson, why does Georgia have an official annotated code? Why not just an official code? I think it's for the benefit of readers so that those finding aids are present.
And I think the reason why they made it official is because they wanted to have an annotated version subject to a price cap so that it would be available to people at a relatively low price. Probably governmental -- look, I mean, I thought this isn't that difficult.
If a judge does something in his judicial capacity, it is not copyrightable.
If a legislator does something or a group of legislators in their legislative capacity, it is not copyrightable. I mean, who cares who the author is? There are public policy reasons that have existed forever in the law that you make those two things not copyrightable. The executive is harder to separate out, but you could do it.
Now that, I think, is basically the SG's position.
If it's not in their official capacity, if it's simply a summary or it's a comment upon something done in an official capacity, it is copyrightable, even though it be done by a sworn public servant, all right? There we are. I think that's roughly the SG's position.
When I read that, seemed pretty sensible to me and consistent with the precedents.
You have a somewhat different position. So I guess my question is, is their position, at least as I understand it, acceptable to you? The SG's position is acceptable to us and we win under that standard. Perhaps it would be helpful for me to explain quickly why we do win under that standard. So the Lexis and the Code Revision Commission are not acting in a law-making capacity when making these annotations. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Banks determined that there was consensus that no copyright exists in a work by ""judicial officers in the discharge of their judicial duties."" Banks then held that a judge who in his judicial capacity prepares an opinion or decisions and other materials is not regarded as the author within the meaning of the copyright statute. Those principles from the judicial context also apply in the law-making context. So, if a lawmaker acts in his capacity as a lawmaker and creates a work in the discharge of his law-making duties that is within the process for creating law, no copyright exists. Now, in this case, this case is going to be controlled, however, by Callaghan. Callaghan upheld a copyright in annotations to judicial decisions by an official court reporter, a salaried public officer of the court, who was appointed and removable by the court.
Such annotations are written after the fact as an attempt to accurately describe or provide context for the underlying source that -- Mr. Yang -- I'm sorry. Finish your sentence. Well, I was just going to say that the -- the annotations here are research aids.
They are created after the fact. They provide a comprehensive, not a selective selection of materials related to the statutes. There's no approval for the substance. And, in fact, the context is easier than Callaghan because it's made by a -- Don't finish it that far. (Laughter.) Okay.
All right.
I'm happy to stop. I'm -- I'm glad I asked you to finish it because if -- I mean, you stressed that the Commission doesn't do anything with respect to these annotations. Suppose the Commission did do something with respect to these annotations. They didn't write them themselves, but they supervised the process carefully.
They were -- they -- they imposed some kind of editorial standards.
What then? I don't know that that would make a difference to the bottom line.
Our understanding of the test that draws from Banks is that when a lawmaker acts in his capacity as a lawmaker in the discharge of law-making duties -- Are you saying that the Commission just doesn't count as a lawmaker? Is that -- Well, and they're not discharging lawmaking duties, yes, because the Commission is composed of 15 individuals, five of which are not even in the legislative process.
In Harrison, the Supreme Court of Georgia recognized that those non-legislative people could actually make the difference in any kind of decision.
So it's -- So -- so -- but the legislature sets up this Commission and puts a bunch of its members on this Commission. Yep. And let's say, in my hypothetical world, this Commission actually takes its job seriously and imposes some editorial standards for what will and will not go into the annotation.
Still -- Same result and -- but it's also in the context of the rest of this case, Section 1-1-1.
The statutory portion of the -- the -- what's produced by Lexis in the -- and the Commission is enacted as statute.
But Section 1-1-7 explains that the notes, the annotations and the other things, are for convenient reference and do not constitute the law. Every year they enact this.
And there's a good example. Well, the people look at the annotations pretty carefully as guides to what that law is all about. Well, if they looked at the annotations -- And if the Commission is basically involved in -- in what should be in and what shouldn't be in to explain to people what the law means, why would that be copyrightable? I don't think they're actually explaining what the law means.
They're describing what other -- this is better than Callaghan because, in Callaghan, the reporter was at least superintended by the court, right? Could have been removed by the court, was hired by the court, appointed by the court. Here, they're describing what third parties do, what courts do.
To the extent there's any relationship, it's only with the legislature, and even there it's attenuated. So you think even if the Commission actually wrote the annotations, it would still -- That's right, because -- and look what the annotations are.
Under this contract, they are intended to be comprehensive. They don't say this is a good opinion, this is right, this is wrong.
They just want to cover the waterfront, right or wrong, accurately describe the judicial sources that are out there, the attorney general's opinions, law reviews, other types of secondary ALRs, these types of things.
It -- it's finding -- Would it make a difference if -- if, instead of the Commission, it were done by the legislature itself? You know, I think that would be a little more complicated. But all they do is -- is describe what judges do. After the -- That's it. Oh, no, I think that would be the same. Okay. I -- I think you would -- Let's say it was adopted by the legislature too, and let's say we put the word ""official"" on it for whatever good that does market -- market power-wise.
Then what? Well, if it's done as it is done here, which I think, if you look, for instance, in the Respondent's brief at pages 2a and 3a, the -- the -- it's prepared -- it says the official code, I mean, is prepared by the Commission, legislative counsel, and Lexis.
And then the next page over, it says the statutory portion is a true and correct copy.
It's certified. What's official, what's certified as correct, is the text of the statute. All right. Isn't a different -- Nice evasion, but if we could just answer the question -- (Laughter.) No, no, I -- but I don't think -- -- I'd be grateful. Let's say the legislature itself does the reviewing of all of the judicial opinions and then it collects the ones and then it enacts it and calls it official or not official.
You choose.
I don't care. Is that copyrightable? Yes, if they are doing it in the same way, which is that they're -- Because it's not -- -- they're covering the waterfront. -- in the same capacity, right? I mean, that's what it comes down to.
It's not in its legislative capacity. It's in some other abstract capacity in which a legislature can act. That is our understanding as drawn from Banks. Then the answer is no.
Then the answer is no to his question, because the -- the whole point, I thought, is that you could very abstractly, the no explains it, I do, says the bride, you can't copyright that.
It's being used as a performative.
It's not an expression. Now take that idea and bring it down to the legislature and making laws.
Where you have some words on pieces of paper and they are performing a function that is a legislative function or a judicial function, no, it's not solely an expression; it's performing a function, and we don't allow it because to let a monopolist get ahold of that is dangerous. Well, I don't think -- And that -- that's -- that's what I thought that the argument was as I got the entire brief. I'm not sure there's any disagreement.
What I intended to say was that the annotations would be copyrightable; the statute would not. If it is a description of what other parties are doing, there's no particular -- I -- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I'm -- now I'm turned between my two colleagues. Well, maybe this will clarify. Let me -- let me clarify -- let me just get to something very simple, okay? Let's assume there are some states that have pro se guidelines.
To pro se litigants, this is how you follow the law. Could they copyright those and -- and charge for them and preclude others from copying them and disseminating them? If, for instance, this is like a -- your -- it's -- let me draw an example.
When you do -- when the court adopts rules for -- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or otherwise, there are often advisory committee notes that explain kind of context.
We understand -- Right.
Is that copyrightable? We understand that -- no, we understand that to be in the context of the rule-making proceeding. All right. All right.
Now -- So why is that different if -- and I think your brief made very clear, committee reports, even on failed legislation, wouldn't be copyrightable. Materials prepared for that process are not copyrightable unless the individual -- the state didn't require them or -- or create them. So why is it that an official guide to an official code where the annotations merge with that code that are prepared by the state, why aren't those copyrightable? There's a -- Why aren't they like -- There's a few things that are, I think, incorrect in the premise.
One, if you look at Callaghan, you had annotations by the official court reporter, superintended by the court, combined in a single volume, still copyrightable.
So the fact that they're together, not relevant. Second, when we're talking about annotations here, we're talking about a description of case 1.
Case 1 says the statute means X; case 2 means the statute means Y.
They reproduce both of them.
They're not saying that 1 -- Suppose that weren't true. So is it -- -- isn't the law. Suppose the Commission, when it supervised, part of its supervision, it looked over the annotations and it picked out a few that it thought were egregiously wrong in terms of interpreting the law.
Would that make a difference? You know, I think it would start to be a little harder.
It starts to sound a lot like -- more like post-enactment legislative history, if it were done by the legislature. A little bit harder, but that's still copyrightable if the -- if the Commission is saying no, that's an incorrect interpretation of law? You know, I -- We'll take out that annotation? -- I think because the Commission, is, again, making an observation with respect to what these other parties do, they don't have any particular expertise, it's not the legislature itself doing this, I think -- Okay.
Now I'm going to go back to Justice Gorsuch.
How about the legislature? Well, if the legislature did that, I think there would be a question whether that is part of the legislative process -- Isn't that -- -- for instance, for -- -- isn't that Banks? I mean, isn't that the -- potentially Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical, the distinction between Banks and Callaghan or not? Well, I think Banks -- In other words, can't you give up that hypothetical and still win? I think we could give it up, but let me -- let me take a step back and say we can look -- start looking to the fringes of this case, but when we look at the core of what -- what this is about and the way that this has arisen, the test that we think flows from Banks and Callaghan is one that takes care of the real-world consequences here. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Citron. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's useful to remember that the question Georgia presented in this case was whether the government edicts doctrine extends to documents that lack the force of law.
The answer to that question is clearly yes.
The United States agrees with us that it has to be yes.
That's required by the Court's decision in Banks.
And it seems necessary unless legislative history, agency guidance documents, unpublished judicial decisions are going to be subject to copyright. Now Georgia hasn't proposed an alternative test, but we've proposed a test that we've drawn from the language in this Court's decisions, particularly Wheaton as it was understood by Justice Story and Callaghan, which adopted that understanding, and it asks two straightforward questions: Is this a legal work and is it published under the authority of the state? If it is, then it can't be copyrighted, and that makes sense because states don't publish authentic state legal works for the purposes of making money or maximizing profit.
They publish them so that people will understand their legal obligations. And so you do not need the copyright incentive to ensure that these works get made. Why is it different if the state -- or is it? The state hires an official historian.
The historian's job is to write the history of the State of Georgia. After a committee reads it and says yes, then they stamp it official.
They have a copyright contract, so they get the -- the state gets the copyright.
Is it copyrightable? I think that is copyrightable because -- Because? Why is that copyrightable and yet a comment made by the professor's cousin, who happens to teach in law school, is not copyrightable? Uh -- The comment being on the state of the law, the comment being a summary of the cases, the comment being the -- the six things listed on page, whatever it was, page 497, the seven things.
How is that different? I guess I want to answer both parts of the question, but I'm going to take the second part first.
I don't think a law professor speaking in the voice of the state or that something a law professor publishes is published under the authority of the state, so that would be copyrightable under our test. Nor do I think that an official state history is a legal work, and so that wouldn't be captured by our test either.
And there is a difference because, when the state speaks -- when you speak in the state's voice with respect to a legal work, you're asserting a kind of authority.
That has value that it doesn't have when the state publishes its poetry. I understand, Mr. Citron, that the SG is essentially saying, well, for these annotations, the state is not telling you what it thinks about the law.
The state is doing no more and no less than what Westlaw does. So the state's view of the law is just like Westlaw's view of the law.
Why should we treat the two differently? Well, I -- I don't think they're the same for two reasons.
One is these annotations are produced in the name of and the voice of the Code Revision Commission, and the Code Revision Commission is not a non-entity. Code Revision Commissions are responsible for assembling the text of the statutes and the other things that go into the official code.
And, look, in the United States context, 27 of the titles of the United States Code are simply the product of a Code Revision Commission.
They aren't enacted as texts. So these Code Revision Commissions, they do exercise a legislative function.
They assemble the text of the statutes. How is that different from the court reporter? Because the court reporter doesn't -- isn't responsible for the text of the opinions at all, right? They're not allowed to move around the text and say, well, this would be clearer -- They're responsible for the text of what they -- they produce as the summary. What they add they are responsible for, but the court is not responsible for it, and that's the big difference.
Being the official reporter doesn't prevent you from adding whatever you want to the report. If Henry Wheaton had added things the Court didn't like to the 1815 term report, they're not required to pay him for the 1816 term, but they can't pull the 1815 term report off the shelves.
It's up to him what goes in that book.
That's the complete opposite of what happens with Lexis and the OCGA. Lexis can't add one thing to the OCGA outside the state's authority.
The hypothetical facts you pose, those are the actual facts of this case.
The undisputed material facts are that all the materials in the OCGA are finalized under the direct supervision of the Code Revision Commission. And what's the -- what's the difference between the Commission and the -- and the reporter? I'm sorry. The difference between the Commission and the reporter? Yeah, the court reporter. The Commission -- In other words, how do you deal with Callaghan and Wheaton, I guess, and Howell, if we're going to bring in the Sixth Circuit decision in Howell? I think the difference is that the classic judicial reporter, particularly in the 19th century, which is what we should try to keep in mind, spoke in their own voice when they added materials to the Court's opinion. The Code Revision Commission does not speak in its own voice.
It's not like Westlaw, something you read on the Internet.
It's speaking in the state's voice when it puts the annotations in. The annotations may not be very valuable.
They might not be worth a lot in court, just like legislative history in front of many judges is not worth a lot in court.
But it's still an authentic state legal document. It still comes through in the voice of the state.
And that's the difference. Does this amount to anything other than the label that's put on this volume? Suppose they put -- they made it clear in labeling the volume that the law itself is the official -- the code itself is the official law of the State of Georgia, all of the rest is not official. Uh -- Would that take care of the problem? I don't think it would take care of the problem in the following sense. If the state is the one that actually puts together the annotations, and it's known that these are the state's annotations, labeling part of it official and part of it unofficial is not going to do the trick. But that does go a long way.
I think our main objection is when you confer officiality on these documents and you speak in the state's voice, that's the thing you can't copyright.
If they wanted to have the official Code of Georgia with annotations by Lexis, they could certainly have that. Mr. Citron, in both Wheaton and in Callaghan, both opinion mentioned that the cover pages said that these reports were by the individuals, not by the state. Yeah. And so the state wasn't claiming ownership or title to these annotations, correct? That's right. That's different from here, where neither Lexis nor -- am I wrong? I don't think the annotation tells us who prepared the annotations, or does it? I -- I didn't look specifically. I mean, the reason the Eleventh Circuit got confused about whether these comments were -- who they were authored by and whether they were distinguishable from the other kinds of annotations in which they claim copyright is there isn't anything on the face of the annotations to tell you who wrote them or who's responsible for them. All right.
Could you please take the government's test? You articulate it, and you tell me why their conclusion is wrong under their test. Well -- I know you don't accept their test, so don't fight the hypothetical. Okay. Okay? Yes. Accept the hypothetical. Yeah. And tell me why they're wrong under their -- their test. I -- I think the simplest understanding is the following.
The Code Revision Commission is in two critical respects like the legislature or exercising a legislative or law-making function. First, it discharges its duties entirely for the behest -- at the behest of and for the benefit of the legislature, and the Georgia Supreme Court has told us that this is an exercise of the legislative authority for purposes of Georgia constitutional law. So trying to draw some line between the Code Revision Commission and the legislature would be, I think, inauthentic.
On top of that, Code Revision Commissions are exercising a legislative function.
They assemble the text of the statutes. If you were to adopt a rule that the Code Revision Commission does not speak for the state, in states like New York, where the statutory text is put together by a Code Revision Commission, you could copyright the statutory text itself because those statutory texts are just evidence of the law.
They're not binding or the force of law vis-A-vis the statutes at large or the like. And but for Section 105, Title 42 of the U.S. Code could be copyrighted too. What does the -- Mr. Citron, may I ask you a basic question of -- of what matters here? One thing is that the annotations have the official state imprimatur, and you say that that's what matters. But why instead shouldn't it matter that these annotations are in no sense the law, they're just useful information on how the law has been interpreted and applied by others? I think it's what you mean by ""in no sense the law,"" which is, I think, a complicated concept.
When it bears the state's imprimatur, it is the law in some sense. It may not be worth very much. The state can say: Look, this is just informational, just the way the IRS when it puts out an FAQ about how to file your tax returns says: Look, this is just informational.
A court might take a different view of it. But, when the state is telling you this is a good summary of the statute -- of -- of the case, you're going to treat that differently.
And it's not for nothing. Well, they're not saying it's a good summary or a bad summary. They may take comments from both sides, one interpreting it one way, one interpreting another way.
They're -- they're useful aids to research, but you say that that doesn't matter, that -- that these -- these are information, just information about how the law has been interpreted and applied without making any judgment whether those are correct or incorrect? Well, the best I can say about it is this.
You know, my colleague said, you know, I think the comments, which are often used by courts as an authentic source of law, probably shouldn't be copyrighted because they are offered as a intended gloss on the code. In their complaint, this is what they say the judicial annotations are there for: ""They must be carefully crafted by Lexis in order to illustrate and interpret the code sections of the OCGA."" That's what they're there for.
The state puts them there to illustrate and help interpret the code for its users. They aren't the law.
You can't cite them in the sense of saying, I know the statute says this, but look at this annotation here. Just the way the notes that are at the end of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure aren't going to overrule the text of the rule, but they do count for something because they come in the state's voice. That's -- that's, I think, the question.
I mean, I agree, you've clarified, everybody to me.
I mean, the question is: What function does this particular set of words play in the law? And if we look at the precedent, back where Justice Ginsburg was, it's hard for me to see that it plays much more of a precedent than Wheaton -- I mean much more of a role than Wheaton's annotations, and I can think of cases where a lot of people would say in respect to Westlaw, in respect to Lexis, and probably here, ah, yes, that's what they say, but go read the case, my friend, and it isn't as good a summary as you think.
All right? So what you'd have to show is that the official Westlaw actually plays a larger role in the law, in a law-making function, than does Westlaw.
I doubt that there's something here that shows that, but maybe there is. I'll give you my best shot, okay? There are no cases in Georgia that have ever cited West's unofficial annotated code of Georgia because it's not official and it's not something you would bring to court and say: Well, look, an editor of Westlaw tells us that this is -- that this case is relevant or that this statute became effective on this date. There are lots of cases that cite the annotations to the OCGA, as such, in Georgia for lots of different kinds of propositions. But I think one question that is -- I think Justice Ginsburg asked it, is -- is -- is some of your examples, they are government documents with a point of view, and -- and when you think about one of these annotation books, it doesn't look like it has a point of view.
It looks like there are annotations of cases on both sides of an issue. And -- and as long as we don't have any sense that the state is editing in order to create a point of view, you know, why doesn't that make a difference? So that's true of the judicial annotations because the judicial annotations are themselves summaries of the cases.
I would say they have a point of view about the cases.
They will tell you what they think is important about those cases. But they don't purport to comment this -- this was a well-decided case, the reasoning here is poor.
I will say the State wants to focus on the judicial annotations because it's hard to imagine using them this way.
You should really focus on the editor's notes, which are also an annotation over which they are asserting copyright in this case. I want to bracket, they claim copyright over everything.
In this case, they decided not to assert against some of the works, including basically everything in the code. They claim it. But the editor's notes -- So what do you mean by ""the editor's notes""? The editor's notes are notes that appear in the OCGA that describe things like when this code provision becomes effective, whether it was the product of a veto, override, or how it was enacted, and it can be extremely important to deciding a case. So one of the cases that we point to where this -- an editor's note was cited is cited for the proposition that the -- the state changed the rule for when a breathalyzer test was admissible, and it did so retroactively to all cases that were pending on -- at the time that it was signed. The state cites -- the court cites the editor's note for that proposition, and that's the reason this person is acquitted in that case. Is there -- is -- is there any other source for that proposition? Sure, you could go back to the statute at large, just like you could for all the non-positive law titles of the U.S. Code. So, if there were an award given out by the Law Review Commission every year for the best treatise in a particular area, in other words, we think this is, you know, the best treatise, and as a result, it's cited more frequently and more authoritatively than other treatises, does that change the copyright status? I don't think so because I don't think that that treatise is still speaking with the authority of the state.
You know, they can say this is a good treatise, in general, you should look at it, but none of the propositions there have been adopted.
And the treatise author certainly doesn't write with authority.
Writing Miller -- But, I mean, the fact that the courts are going to cite that treatise and, you know, with some -- probably more frequency than -- than others, so the fact that you have this editor's note that tells you it's retroactive, that's not what makes it retroactive.
The fact is there's something else that the -- that editor is looking at, and that is the official source that makes it retroactive. The fact that they cite the particular notes for ease of reference or -- or because that editor has developed a reputation as being particularly good, seems to me doesn't transform the nature of those notes. No, I -- I -- I will admit to you at the end of the day that the statute at large is going to control over the editor's note.
The editor's note doesn't have the force of law as such. But that can't be the rule.
It would be wildly over -- under-inclusive to exclude all the things that aren't the -- the best authority at the end of the day. Like I said, all the non-positive law titles of the U.S. Code are like that.
They are only prima facie evidence of the law and you have to point back to the statute at large, if there's a dispute, to say what the law is. But, if that's the rule, like I said, the actual statutory text in the official codes of most of the states can now be copyrighted because that's what Code Revision Commissions do.
They put out these non-positive law titles that are prima facie evidence of the law.
They still have a legal effect.
They just aren't the controlling authority. There's a lot of -- You gave us a -- Go ahead. You gave us a two-part test.
The first part is whether it's a legal work.
What does that mean? It's just a work -- a legal work is going to do one of two things. It's going to purport to state what the law is or interpret it, or it's going to be a part of the process of making it.
And it's not intended to be, you know, a complicated doctrine.
I think it's pretty easy to look at a work and determine whether it's a legal work or not. There's a lot of debate about what the precedents mean here. Should we interpret them in the direction of the text of the Copyright Act, which clearly says states can get copyright protection for annotations? I mean, states can get copyright protection for annotations only insofar as they meet the authorship requirement of the Act.
The authorship requirement was given a gloss in Banks.
Banks says it got that gloss in Wheaton under the Marshall court and Congress has not seen fit -- What -- -- to change it. What about Howell? Do you accept Howell as correctly decided, the Sixth Circuit decision by Justice Harlan? Yeah, we -- we accept Howell as correctly decided and we think it's a good case for us. Explain that. Okay. Because it doesn't seem that way to me, but go ahead. I'll give it my best shot. So it's really important to focus on the order of operations in Howell and how it's different from what happens here. So, in Howell, Howell compiles, acting on his own, a compilation of the Michigan statutes together with his own annotations. After he does that, Michigan passes a statute authenticating just the -- the statutory portion of his work, and it says, you can treat that statutory portion as though it were published under the authority of the state. And that causes Justice Harlan to write an opinion that says, even though Howell did that work on his own, you can cut and paste that text directly out of his book in order to republish a compilation of the laws because no one can own the laws. The other stuff, which Howell had produced first on his own and the state had never authenticated, remained Howell's property. The exact opposite happens with the OCGA. Lexis produces the annotation for and at the commission of a state commission.
The state commission exercises supervisory authority over what those annotations say.
The legislature then requires that those annotations be merged into the official state document, and then the whole document is published under the authority of the State of Georgia. If that's what happened in Howell, I don't think you could copyright the annotations. The merger can't make the difference, though, right? No, I think the merger does make a difference because that is the legislature deciding that these annotations will be part of the code and then publishing that code under the state's authority. It could do the opposite.
It could say we are only -- if it had the authentication that's in the addendum saying the statutory text is authentic, you can treat it as good for cite checking, that's fine.
That's not making the whole volume official. The problem is publishing the whole volume under the authority of the state, including the annotations, and then saying, well, actually, these annotations aren't special, they're not distinguishable from what Westlaw does or anyone else. But, if you cited the annotations as binding law, that would be wrong. Well, two -- two things about that.
One is I -- Or even -- or even instructive.
It would be wrong. I don't think that's right.
If you cited the judicial annotation in court, you said I found this in the OCGA, but -- and I haven't checked the case, but -- but this is what the case says according to the OCGA, I'm not sure each court would treat that as incorrect.
That's a -- that seems to be a plausible -- The court would do -- -- way to use -- Correct me if I'm wrong, the court would do its own independent research to determine the weight to be afforded that authority. Right.
But it does that with lots of things that we all agree are the law for purposes of this copyright rule.
Just like when a agency tells you what that -- what one of its documents means, you're going to construe it, you're going to use your own judicial authority to attempt to determine what it means before accepting the agency's determination, but it still could be a good starting place. It wouldn't be the same if it was just something you read on the Internet. Can I ask you a question from a different direction? Which is the states' amicus brief -- Uh-huh. -- which is a cross-section of states, makes a very strong argument that this is going to create problems in terms of incentives for creating these annotations in the first place, and so the net result of your position, if it wins, so the states claim, is that there will be fewer of these annotations.
Can you respond to that? Yeah, happy to. If the proposition, which has to be Georgia's view, is that the annotations are just the same as private annotations, there is at least one, and usually two, privately annotated legal codes available for every state in the union.
And that includes states that don't copyright anything, and it includes states that make an annotated code available on the Internet for free themselves. So the incentive to create these private works is not going to be affected at all -- So the states are just -- -- by the differences in this case. -- wrong about that? I mean, isn't there a cost/price issue that's involved? Or why are the states saying that if they're -- they have nothing to fear? I -- I don't think the states have anything to fear.
What they want is the official versions to exist.
The official versions bear the states' imprimatur.
They get to supervise what goes in them.
That's the source of the problem with the copyrighting of it. But the unofficial -- and the annotations themselves will exist without regard to whether or not this kind of -- Well, I thought that -- -- copyright issue is -- -- Mr. Johnson told me that they would be more expensive.
Do you dispute that? I do dispute that in two respects.
One is the actual useful versions of these codes are already plenty expensive. There's a lot of discussion of the cost for a printed volume, but online access, which is what really most practitioners need to use, most people want to use, it's much more expensive than the $400. But, even accepting that the price is lower, I think that favors us, because what's going on there is an exchange of -- you're going to accept a price cap in exchange for the right to publish this officially, not for publishing the annotations, because Westlaw makes the annotations and is allowed to charge six times as much. Lexis isn't going to agree to do the annotation work in exchange for a price cap. What it wants for the price cap is the right to publish it officially.
I hope -- I hope that makes sense. There's a good description of this in a brief from some former publishing officials that explain, you know, if -- if this is what's going on, Lexis is essentially being hoodwinked. What's your best -- what is your best evidence that the state actually edits what Lexis does or supervises the substance of what Lexis does? Well, so there's a couple of things in the publication manual that set forth how Lexis is supposed to communicate with the state, and it requires sending them memos with bracketing around what the new material is, Xeroxing the pages on which any ALR notes or opinions of the attorney general might be deleted and pointing them out for state approval. The publication manual also highlights situations in which the state is likely to tell them what kind of editor's note to create surrounding complicated amendments or the like. So the Commission is involved, but we don't have -- because the case was decided on summary judgment, we just don't have a record of how often this -- the Commission actually -- The -- I just thought of a possible -- this should shed a lot of light in a number of areas.
One of those areas is only applicable to some judges.
Some judges do look at legislative history.
So, for those who do look at legislative history, a committee report has significance.
All right? Now take the same words and imagine that a senator, long afterwards, came into court and testified that's what we meant.
Would we give that senator weight? No.
Or suppose that the committee met after it was passed.
That's called post-enactment legislative history.
Does that have some weight? Usually very little. And that's because that isn't normally their job.
That isn't normally part of the lawmaking process.
Thinking of that analogy, it seems to me that your case lies somewhere between the official post-enactment legislative history and, over here, the senator walking into the courtroom and just saying, that's what I meant. Now is that fair? Because I don't think you like me thinking that way. Oh, I'm comfortable -- You are? -- with you thinking that way.
And I think that that's one of the main points I've been trying to make here.
There is a difference between being worth very little but nonetheless being official, authentic state legal resource, and being worth nothing because you're not an authentic state legal resource. It's not even the senator walking in and testifying, right? What we need you to compare this to is somebody from the New York Times walking in and testifying that this is what people had in mind when they enacted this statute. That's not good for anything because it's not a state legal resource.
It doesn't speak in the -- in the voice of the state.
And you can disagree about how much weight to give something that is nonetheless an authentic state legal resource, but that's the thing that makes the difference. And that, again, is the difference between these cases and Howell and Wheaton. Howell and Wheaton were allowed to add whatever they wanted. Presumably, a certified copy of the committee report would not be post hoc. Whether -- I think the point I was trying to make is post hoc or not might affect how much weight you want to give it, but the fact that it's a certified committee report is the thing that really makes the difference. Now I -- I understand Justice Ginsburg's question because I do think there's -- the comments troubled me, taking the government and Petitioners' side, the editorial notes trouble me, but most of the references in the notes are just to judicial decisions and/or general research matters. If it were limited just to that, is that -- why can't the state -- I -- I'll just give you -- -- this is what -- Yeah.
I'll try to give you the best example we could find.
In one of the state cases that cites a judicial annotation, what happened was a lawyer from Florida didn't file a response to a motion for summary judgment, because he looked up the statute, and the statute says there's going to be a hearing in 30 days; you can file something up until the hearing. Turns out that there's a rule that says, no, you have to file a response or else it might be deemed forfeited.
And the court is deciding whether his failure to file a response is excusable neglect.
And the court says: Well, if you look at the annotations to this statute, it discloses the existence of Rule 6.3, which is not inconsistent with the statute. And this is what happens when you have a state legal manual like the OCGA that has official annotations in it.
Courts will find ways and regular people will find ways to attribute importance to things that are difficult to use for judicial purposes but sometimes will. And the reason they do that is because this is a legal work that speaks in the voice of the state and not just the bare work of someone who happens to be a legal editor at Westlaw or something like that. But that would be a mistake, right? I mean, isn't that -- it would be a mistake to attribute the significance to it. I don't know if it would be a mistake or not. Under -- under state law, it would be a mistake. I mean, what -- what they did was attribute significance to the fact that you could find it there in the manual, when they were trying to figure out -- But, under state law -- -- what would be -- -- isn't that -- that's wrong. Well, no, the state law would say that it would be wrong in construing the meaning of that statute, but it isn't necessarily wrong for figuring out what's excusable neglect, right? Whether it's good lawyering or bad lawyering, not to look at the annotations in the OCGA isn't governed by the statute.
The statute doesn't say -- Section 1-1-1 doesn't say anything about that. Well, but it would also be pertinent to the question of excusable neglect to look at what, you know, all the treatises said.
I mean, if I'm writing an opinion about whether the lawyer should have known that, I would say every -- all the treatises about Georgia law, you know, highlight the fact that you've got to file a response. I -- I think you and I may have different instincts about that.
I think it would be more appropriate for a judge to say, well, look, in the official state legal code, there are annotations that point to the rule that you neglected.
And I think that's more persuasive.
That's different than saying, well, if you happen to look at the unofficial codification that Westlaw does, there's an indication that that rule exists.
That's the difference. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Johnson. I want to start briefly by talking about the different portions of the OCGA, things like editors' notes. We talked in our brief about why the editors' notes should be copyrightable, why the Dominiak case that my friend on the other side just was describing doesn't undermine our copyright claim. But I think the crucial point on this is that PRO copied the entirety of the OCGA, including the judicial decision summaries that I think are clearly copyrightable under Wheaton and Callaghan. So PRO has to run the table on all portions of the OCGA to get an affirmance here, and I just don't think that they can. The PRO's main argument seems to be that the fact that the OCGA is official means that it cannot be copyrightable.
And I just don't think that that's consistent with history or this Court's precedents. Again, going back to Wheaton and Callaghan, you had official court reporters holding copyright in annotations.
And given that those were government officials, I just don't think that it can make a difference here that the state is the one holding the copyright. I think that this case is the legislative analogue of Wheaton and Callaghan. But I think it's also important to look at the history of the Copyright Act.
So the Copyright Office in the 1959 study and 1961 report interpreted the 19th century precedents we're talking about here as holding that states could hold copyright in annotations by state government employees, and then Congress passed the modern Copyright Act without in any way overriding that understanding or expanding the government edicts doctrine. Under that understanding, we win here. And then the final point that I want to touch on is how affirming the decision below would be very disruptive for states.
So about a third of states have the same regime as Georgia. They claim copyright in annotations to an annotated official code by commercial publishers. So affirming the decision below would blow up those regimes. There are at least two additional states that claim copyright in annotations by state government employees and five other states where the commercial publisher holds the copyright in the annotated official code.
Those regimes would probably also fall if the court's decision below was affirmed. So I think that statutory text and precedent compel a decision for Georgia here. Any innovations on the government edicts doctrine should come from Congress, not the courts.
The Court should reverse. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-776, Guerrero-Lasprilla versus Ovalles and Attorney General Barr. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section (2)(D) provides for review of questions of law decided by the Board of Immigration Appeals.
I'll start with where we and the government agree.
At minimum, courts may review whether the Board identified the proper legal standard.
The government agrees. For this review to be meaningful and not just a requirement of correct boilerplate, courts must determine whether the government used the proper standard.
Again, the government agrees.
Review extends to whether ""the Board actually used the wrong standard."" Despite acknowledging this, the government fails to distinguish how reviewing whether the Board actually used the correct standard is different than reviewing whether the Board correctly applied that standard.
In our view, these inquiries are effectively the same. They use the same tool, applying the correct legal standard to the facts. To the extent there is a difference, the government does not provide a test for telling them apart.
Jurisdictional rules need to be clear, but the government does not explain how courts decide whether the Board actually used the correct standard. Our rule is clear.
There is no judicial review over historical facts, but there is review over their legal significance.
The Court should adopt this construction for three reasons. First, it accords with the essential premise of judicial review which the statutory text has unmistakably established.
Second, it is necessary for Congress to have fully responded to St. Cyr.
And, third, it is a clear rule which is crucial to establish the boundaries of jurisdiction. Turning to what Congress needed to do in order to fully respond to St. Cyr, there are at least four separate points that illustrate Congress had to create jurisdiction for the application of law to fact. Well, before you get to that, I wonder if you have not read too much into the government's statement that a -- that under their theory, it would be permissible for a court to review not just whether the -- the -- the Board articulated the right theory but whether it actually used the right theory. When I read that, I thought what they were saying was that review would extend to those perhaps rare situations where, although it was in response to your argument that if the -- if the -- if the right standard was merely mentioned, that would be sufficient.
And I thought they were just saying that if it was clear that even though the right standard was mentioned, you could see that that was not at all what was being done, that there would be review there. So I thought that was a very narrow exception.
So the -- the difference between what I understood them to be arguing and your position was considerably larger than what you suggested to start out. Well, as Your Honor suggests, I think the government does agree that if the -- the decision of the Board on the face invokes the correct standard, but a reasonable reader of that decision would appreciate that that standard was not used to actually decide the case, that there would be judicial review over that. Once the government agrees with that, which I think they must, otherwise it's judicial review in substance -- or not in substance at all, only in form, once the government agrees with that, they haven't actually articulated how that test differs from applying law to fact. And our point is that -- Well, I think it's like a sham.
It's a sham exception.
So, if that's really not what's going on, they're not really applying the right theory, the theory that they claim to apply, there would be review in that situation.
That's how I read it.
Now -- Oh, well, Your Honor, I -- -- Mr. Liu can correct that. -- I think a few things about that.
First, I think it's very difficult to distinguish what makes for a sham articulation of the standard versus not actually looking to determine whether it was properly applied. How do we determine if it was a sham? You consider what the right standard is.
You consider the facts.
And if the facts turn out to be a textbook application of that standard, but the Board reached the opposite conclusion, you would find that it was a sham. But there's a big difference between your two positions, and it has to do with the application of -- of the legal standard to the facts where the -- the legal standard requires a considerable exercise of judgment, as it does with equitable tolling, where you have to determine whether there's due diligence or exceptional circumstances.
You would say all of that can be reviewed. Well, Your Honor, yes, but I think to the extent there's a difference, if there is a difference, it's a difference in degree, but the government doesn't provide a way to distinguish between when the degree is sufficiently enough to say that the standard wasn't actually used. But the other problem with this is, if that is the test that the government advances, it has the effect of merging the underlying merits of the inquiry with the jurisdictional analysis. The end result would be there would be jurisdiction if the decision of the Board was really, really wrong, but not if it was a little bit wrong.
And so that result would be that you'd -- you'd have to do the merits inquiry to figure out even if you have jurisdiction over the case. Well, suppose we -- we take their principal argument, which is that this applies -- the only thing that can be reviewed is a pure question of law, all right? That's a clear rule.
Is it not? Yes, and I don't think they actually stick with that, but that would be a clear -- a clear rule.
Yes, Your Honor. Okay.
And under your interpretation, what is the difference between the degree of review that is permitted in the case of a criminal alien and the degree of review that's permitted in the case of a non-criminal alien? So there -- It's very, very -- it's very slight, right? I don't think so, Your Honor.
There's a very substantial difference, and that's that there's no review over all of the factual determinations that are made.
And there are very substantial factual determinations that are often dispositive of removal cases that are made throughout these proceedings, and those would not be subject to judicial review. Yeah.
Well -- But those are all made under a substantial evidence standard.
It's a highly deferential standard.
So I take your point that there might be a few cases that would come out differently, but it would be rare, wouldn't it? I don't think it would necessarily be rare, Your Honor.
I think there are many cases where courts of appeals, under substantial evidence review, still reverse the -- the factual findings. But what we have here is we have a statute, (2)(D), that was written far after (2)(C), and the reason that (2)(D) was -- was written on top of (2)(C) was as a response to what this Court held in St. Cyr.
So I think, to understand what Congress was trying to accomplish in (2)(D), it's important to understand what Congress needed to do in order to respond to what this Court -- Could I take you off -- -- held in St. Cyr. I'm sorry.
You keep on wanting to talk about St. Cyr and we keep wanting to talk about other things. But, before you get to that, throughout your brief, there's this idea that really mixed questions of law are pure questions of law.
I mean, that, you know, if we have to put them in one bucket or another, they should go in the legal bucket because they're all matters of interpretation, you say; they're all essentially law-like. But, you know, I started looking around to -- to think about some of the other questions that your view might suggest is a law question, and so here are just a few that I came up with: whether a non-citizen's removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship, whether a non-citizen has been subjected to extreme cruelty, whether changed country conditions are present. I could go on, but all of these -- you know, if you just sort of look at them and say what is it mostly going to involve, it seems as though most of those questions are going to mostly involve fact-finding. So, Your Honor, a few responses to that.
First, some of the examples that you gave are ultimately issues that are discretionary.
And when we have a discretionary question, of course, there's a different framework under (2)(B) which would -- there would be review over the eligibility for the discretionary determination; for example, whether or not there's a changed country condition is likely a discretionary determination by the Board. But to -- but to get to Your Honor's principal question about how we disentangle the -- the facts and the law here, and I think the question goes to whether or not the Lakeridge style analysis, where we characterize mixed questions as more principally legal or more principally factual, should be used in this context. And I think that, of course, the Court has established that sort of framework for use in other parts of the law. Well, I wasn't even talking about using the Lakeridge framework here.
I was just sort of talking about the assumption that your briefs make that, if you were to put these in one bucket, just one bucket, it should be the legal bucket, that these are really law questions. And I guess I'm saying that when I look at the range of these questions, quite a lot of them seemed to me to be really fact questions, you know, cases where it's not only the finding of facts, but it's the weighing of facts, the making credibility judgments, the weighing, you know, the balancing of different facts against each other, that sort of thing. So, Your Honor, I -- I agree insofar as what the Board is doing is finding historic facts or finding credibility or adding historic facts to make other judgments about historic facts or predictions about future facts.
Those sorts of factual determinations are things that there would not be jurisdiction under 2(D). What our point is, is once those historic facts have been found and then a legal standard is applied to those facts, that aspect of the mixed question is legal.
So -- and let me try to clarify our briefs. We think in every mixed question, by its definition, there is a legal element and there's a factual element.
And so sometimes it's true the factual element will be far greater than the legal element. But our point is that 1252 creates a structure where there is judicial review insofar as there is the legal element of the mixed question, and that, unlike what happens in other contexts where those two are put together and there is a single standard of review provided, the structure that 1252 creates is the courts disaggregate the -- the -- the legal findings from the factual findings and they have to set those aside. So all of the examples Your Honor provided about the factual findings we agree are not reviewable.
But, to the extent there's the application of a legal standard or considering the legal significance of those historic facts, that is where the -- the -- the Board is doing legal work and there is judicial review over that, as a question of law -- I was thinking -- -- under Section 2(D). -- about this in similar terms to Justice Kagan, but what I realize gave me some clarity was a statement that my colleague made in a case involving the exceptional circumstances of diligence and where he said it's a question of law, because let's take the cruel -- cruelty issue. Whether a punch is cruel or a knife wound is or a threat to family is, all of those are facts that can be found by the BIA or a finder of fact.
But whether it constitutes or rises to the level of the legal standard is a question of law, correct? I think that's right, Your Honor.
And one example in this case is -- is the issue of whether or not the Fifth Circuit's decision in Lugo-Resendez qualifies as an extraordinary circumstance.
Either that change in the law qualifies as an extraordinary circumstance, which has substantial effects for equitable tolling, or it doesn't. But whatever the answer to that question is, that's the sort of legal issue that should be decided the same. Well, but, I -- I mean, you know, is a punch cruel? I mean, obviously, in the -- in the abstract, it could be anything to -- however soft it is, to the extent it's an offense to dignity or, you know, I mean, isn't -- wouldn't one thing to do if you're trying to figure that out to be look at the range of legal decisions, determinations, that said this conduct is cruel, this conduct is not, this conduct is cruel, and I don't know that that makes it any easier to characterize. Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, the Court has found that it is relatively easy, although there is always line drawing, but the courts are well equipped to be able to distinguish between where historic fact ends and legal conclusions begin.
That's something the courts have to do every day of the week when they resolve 12(b)(6) motions, for example, where Iqbal and Twombly instruct the courts to set aside legal conclusions that are within a complaint. So I -- But don't -- we do -- -- agree those -- -- we do know that Congress meant to restrict the court of appeals' review of orders of removal of criminal aliens, so that was Congress's purpose when it wanted the limited -- limited review in -- in the case of removal of criminal aliens. And you -- you -- your position is only fact disputes are reviewable, no law, application of law to undisputed facts, only straight out fact disputes. And how often do straight out fact disputes come to court of appeals? Because usually facts are decided in the first instance. Well, Your Honor, I can say that factual disputes are very often entirely dispositive of removal proceedings. It's true that those cases may be less often appealed because of the substantial or the standard of review that courts of appeals apply, but I can just provide a few examples of factual issues that are often dispositive. For example, an individual might claim that they were born in the United States, so, in fact, a U.S. citizen.
They might claim that examples of past persecution occurred, so they're entitled to asylum, but the Board might disagree. That can include, if they had forced sterilization or forced abortions, the Board will have to decide whether or not those things occurred. Did the individual testify credibly? That will often be dispositive of the removal proceeding.
And I can go on with a list of different issues.
For example, was the individual convicted of the particular crime or was it somebody else with the same name? Those are factual disputes that the Boards are resolving or that the immigration judges in the first instance and then the Boards are resolving on a daily basis. Mr. Hughes, along similar lines, the question we have here is reasonable diligence.
That -- that's the big question.
And when that's reviewed under 1252, where it can be reviewed, my understanding is the courts of appeals review that for abuse of discretion.
And that would typically be the case in a lot of questions where diligence is -- is the issue.
The courts of appeals will review that for -- for abuse of discretion. If that's right -- and just suppose for a moment that's right, all right? Let's not argue about that.
Let's suppose that's the right standard of review.
What does that teach us about the -- the question before us? As Your Honor suggests, I -- I -- our principal argument is to resist the premise.
We do think that the weight of the laws in this Court's precedent is treating diligence not as -- as a question of law that is reviewed de novo. But if the Court -- accepting the premise and the Court disagrees with us, which I don't think it should, but if the Court does disagree with us, what this Court still holds is, to the extent that there is deference or -- or -- a discretion that lies with the Board, still the proper way to approach Section 2(D) in these contexts is to determine whether or not the individual has shown their legal eligibility, that 2(D) provides review over that eligibility for the ultimate exercise of discretion. So even if reasonable diligence is discretionary, and we don't think it is, but there would still be the question if they've shown the threshold step of being eligible. And Your Honor's decision in Iliev in the Tenth Circuit, I think, clearly established how, even when there is an underlying discretionary determination, there is -- I think I did everything I could to avoid this question in that case, and I think you know that. But I -- I -- I -- I guess I'm just trying to disentangle what would be available for us to review legally versus what would then be left to the Board, the discretionary decision, if, in fact, we review the case for abuse of discretion in our legal review. Well, Your Honor, where I think abuse of discretion comes in is not at the question of -- of diligence.
It comes in with whether or not the Board chooses to reopen the case. The Board -- that is a decision that we agree the Board has discretion as to whether or not to reopen the case.
I think diligence, as this Court has said in Bank of Columbia, and I can cite five more cases, that is a pure question of law. But, when the Board decides a case in a different way and says we're deciding this as a matter of discretion, we're issuing what the Board calls a discretionary denial, that is the sort of issue that is not subject to judicial review. And when the Board does a discretionary denial, that is very clear on the face of it.
And let me just provide an example. We -- we just went and found a recent BIA decision from November 1, 2019.
This is Matter of CASD.
And the Board said ""we conclude that Respondent does not merit a favorable exercise of discretion because 'the equities in his case are insufficient to outweigh his history of very serious and violent criminal conduct.'"" When the Board is exercising its discretion to make a discretionary denial, it says so expressly on the face of the opinion. We agree that none of that exercise of discretion when appropriate is reviewable, and that could be the case with a motion to reopen, where the Board does have discretion. But the Board did not exercise that discretion in this case.
It found that he was ineligible for -- Mr. Hughes, I mean, I think the question that Justice Gorsuch asked is a very broad one, and it's -- it's with respect not just to the diligence but to all these other questions that you think should end up being reviewable, like the ones that I mentioned, which sound awfully factual, you know, extreme cruelty, whether there is unusual hardship, whether there's changed country conditions. All of those are reviewed generally with a highly deferential standard. And -- and that suggests that -- that -- that -- that everybody's aware that most of the work is being done at the factual level and the application of the legal standard at the end is -- is -- is not where the action is.
And given what Justice Ginsburg was saying about Congress's intent here, which was pretty clearly to withdraw review power from large categories of cases, except the ones that were principally legal in quality, you know, why -- why doesn't that suggest that you're putting too much in this reviewable basket? Well, Your Honor, to the extent those questions, as you say, are driven principally by the facts and the legal work is only doing a little tail at the end, then that would be true on appeal as well.
The legal work would not be doing a whole lot, and the decisions might be established by the facts that would be found by the Board and would not be reviewable. But let me provide an example where I think it is heavily factual, but I think we would say that review would be a question of law.
Assume for a moment in an asylum case there's a question of past persecution, which is very important in asylum cases.
Persecution is generally defined as a threat to one's life or freedom, and past persecution creates a presumption of future persecution. The Board takes a case.
They properly state that standard.
Then they find these facts: An individual was imprisoned in a particular country for a decade because of their membership in a political party.
That is a classic case of persecution.
But then the Board concludes: This individual was not subject to past persecution. Well, what do you do with that case? The Board said that they properly -- they identified the proper standard, they found the facts, and usually the facts are going to be dispositive, but there at the end where that -- the -- the law issue came in was only a very small part of the case but turned out to be dispositive. I think the government even agrees that, in circumstances like that, for judicial review to actually be substantive judicial review, there would have to be review in that case.
And we think that is critical for the Court to recognize that in cases like that, there is judicial review. On the statutory history point that Justice Kagan raised, St. Cyr involves what the Court characterized as pure questions of law.
Congress, we know, then comes in, and there are a variety of statutes, as you're aware, that refer to mixed questions, but Congress in this statute does not refer specifically to mixed questions. So, if you put those two things together, you would lean toward reading this statute to refer to what one might call pure questions of law.
That's the government's argument.
How do you respond to that statutory history? A few reasons, Your Honor.
First, I think this is the government's three-part topology, that Congress speaks of mixed questions.
And I think that's disproven by a section of the REAL ID Act that is just a couple sections after where (2)(D) was created, and that amended (b)(9), the zipper clause, in a way to deal with all of the issues that arise in immigration, and there it speaks of law or fact. So we know that Congress often speaks of law or fact to be inclusive of the whole universe. But the second point is, in order to respond to St. Cyr, what Congress knew or was attempting to do -- and this is shared ground with the government -- was take the scope of then existing habeas jurisdiction that was occurring in the district courts, keep that scope of jurisdiction the same, and move that jurisdiction into the courts of appeals for petitions for review under Section 1252. The evidence there is unanimous that four courts of appeals following St. Cyr had looked at the -- that decision and addressed the scope of jurisdiction.
All four courts had found that there was decidedly jurisdiction to resolve the application of law to fact.
If Congress had not had (2)(D)'s sweep to include applications of law to fact, that habeas jurisdiction that had been recognized in four separate circuits would have been retained. And then a final point on the history there, Your Honor, is that earlier drafts had included the -- the term ""pure questions of law."" That drew a specific objection from commentators during the markup process.
And after that objection to the word ""pure"" was lodged, Congress then struck that limitation and this Court -- But they said that was because it was redundant. Well, that was in the conference report, Your Honor, and if this Court is going to look to the conference report, where I think this is an area to be skeptical because what Congress actually did is far more probative, but if the Court looks to the conference report, I think you look a couple sentences later where the Court -- where the conference report says what happens with mixed questions, you review to the extent there are legal elements.
We think that sweeps in our rule. But, again, I think when the language actually appeared, there was an objection and it was withdrawn.
That's a little bit more probative than what the conference report says on the -- Can you succinctly tell me what the questions of law are in your two cases? Yes, Your Honor.
First, with Mr. Guerrero-Lasprilla, the question is does Lugo-Resendez qualify as an extraordinary circumstance that would then have the effect of affecting his -- his period of reasonable diligence. For Mr. -- I -- I phrased it differently in my own head, whether the existence of adverse circuit precedent serves as an obstacle to filing a timely motion to reopen. That's -- I think that's just a broader way of saying the same question, yes, Your Honor.
I think that that is a -- All right. That is yes. And Mr. Ovalles? There, I think one -- there are a few questions.
The principal one is, is an asserted period of delay alone a basis in order to find that an individual was not reasonably diligent? Is that creation of a per se rule? The Sixth Circuit in the Gordillo case, pointing to earlier Seventh Circuit precedent in the Pervaiz case, said expressly that looking just to the passage of time without considering other factors that suggest a person's diligence in the circumstances is not an appropriate way to undertake the diligence inquiry. So I think that that -- that case is -- is focused on whether or not the Board's application of an eight-month per se rule violated the underlying principles of reasonable diligence. Mr. Hughes, you haven't spoken much about the presumption of reviewability.
I just have a question about the nature of that presumption, and I -- I guess I would like Mr. Liu to answer the same question. Do you think that that presumption is a presumption about congressional intent, or do you think that that presumption is a presumption that's meant to reflect other values? I think it's -- it's both, Your Honor.
I think it's a presumption of congressional intent, but I think it's also a presumption that's meant to reflect the appropriate balance between judicial power and the administrative power because, of course, here, if the Court finds that questions are -- are factual -- lean factual and therefore assign legal work to the administrative agency, the effect that that has is ceding authority from the Article III courts to the administrative courts to have more authority to be able to decide whatever tail legal aspect there is there. So I think the presumption of reviewability goes to not just a congressional presumption but also a separation of powers principle. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress used the words ""questions of law"" in Section 1252(a)(2)(D), it meant questions of law only, not questions of fact and not mixed questions of law and fact. We know that from the text of the provision itself, which doesn't mention questions of fact or mixed questions.
But we also know it from the context in which Congress enacted the provision. In St. Cyr, this Court held that denying criminal aliens a judicial forum for pure questions of law would raise constitutional doubts.
When Congress enacted this provision following St. Cyr, it wanted to provide criminal aliens enough judicial review to avoid those doubts but no more.
Questions of law thus refers to the same questions identified in this Court's decision in St. Cyr, pure questions of law. Now Petitioners would read ""questions of law"" to extend far beyond purely legal questions to encompass every mixed question of law and fact.
But mixed questions aren't mentioned in the text of Section 1252(a)(2)(D), they're not mentioned anywhere in St. Cyr either, and construing questions of law to encompass every mixed question would all but undo Congress's efforts to limit the scope of judicial review in cases involving criminal aliens. Remember it's been Congress's goal since 1996 to streamline and expedite the removal of criminal aliens.
And yet, under Petitioners' reading, criminal and non-criminal aliens alike would get judicial review of all constitutional claims, of all questions of law, and of all mixed questions. The only difference in the judicial review that they would get would be limited to the category of questions of fact, as some of the justices this morning have already noted. That difference would be this: whereas in criminal -- cases involving criminal aliens, the Board's factual findings would be conclusive; whereas in cases involving non-criminal aliens, the Board's factual findings would be conclusive unless not supported by substantial evidence. Now that's a pretty subtle difference, given that courts don't often overturn factual findings for lack of substantial evidence, and if that's the narrow difference that Congress really sought to achieve, one would have thought they would have written these -- But the -- -- provisions differently. -- the original version of the statute had ""pure questions of law."" And to pick up on your point on the statutory history, then that's deleted, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Cohn testifies and says a mixed question of law is in effect a question with two parts, the legal part and the factual part.
The legal part, of course, is reviewable.
That's what the Justice Department said in response to the ACLU's objection to the draft. Right. Was that correct? We do think the legal part is reviewable, but I think it's important to understand what we think that legal part to be. That legal part is the same part this Court identified in Lakeridge.
It is the legal test or standard that the Board used in deciding the case. I -- I think Congress was pretty justified in thinking the word ""pure"" was superfluous.
I mean, just as a matter of ordinary English, you know, a question is a mixed question because it involves both law and fact.
If you leave off the words ""and fact"" and refer only to a question of law, then it's an unmixed question. Mr. Liu, I -- I -- I'd like to poke at that just a little bit and -- and return to Justice Alito's question at the beginning of argument. Sure. Is it the government's position that only pure questions of law are reviewable, or is it also the government's position that there can be some applications that are so egregious that they would rise to the level of being questions of law? It's the former position. So our view is that only pure questions. Okay.
If that's the case, is there any judicial review here meaningfully at all? Because all the BIA has to do is recite the legal standard and we become a rubber stamp -- Right. -- and say, yes, they have recited the correct legal standard. And no matter how unreasonable, no matter how crazy the application is, we have to provide a judicial imprimatur to that decision. Does that -- does that cause any concerns for you, for the government, and what about the clear statement rule and the idea of the presumption of reviewability here and the separation of powers concerns that Justice Kagan pointed out that undergird it? I guess I would just make maybe three points.
First is it's not -- it's not the -- the case that every case is going to involve an already-settled legal principle. There are actually issues of -- of first impression out there, and when the Board decides those legal questions, those are reviewable in the courts of appeals. Now there are going to be cases where the -- the legal standard has been settled, like it is in the -- in the case of reasonable diligence.
It's very easy for the Board to know what the applicable standard is. In those cases, when the Board does state the applicable legal standard, that is, except in the very rare instance that I think Justice Alito alluded to, that's going to be the end of the matter. Well, hold on.
Now -- now -- now you're backtracking, I think, a little bit.
Is -- is it just, if they recite the legal standard, the pure question of law correctly, we're done, or is there some further review by the -- by the court available for completely crazy applications? And I -- I -- I think I've heard you go both ways on that and I'm just trying to -- No, I -- -- nail you down on that. -- I want to give you -- maybe I can illustrate this with an example.
I mean, if -- No, no.
Just before -- before we get in -- into examples, if you could just firmly answer the question. The -- the -- in our view, the Court can never review an application of law to fact. Okay.
All right. Never review that.
What it can do is make sure the Board used the correct legal standard. So, if the Board says the -- the standard for equitable tolling is reasonable diligence, but then it goes on to cite cases from a bygone era where the standard was maximum feasible diligence and says, oh, we're -- we're going to apply this case there, apply this case there, the -- the Court doesn't need to review any part of the application of law to fact -- I understand. -- to know that the Board has used the wrong standard. Suppose the -- the issue is whether there were exceptional circumstances that might justify equitable tolling, and let's say the -- the alien in question was in a coma. What would happen there? No judicial -- and they say, well, that's not an exceptional circumstance. Well, I -- I -- I think to the extent the question is, as a categorical matter, is being in a coma an exceptional circumstance, that could be a question of law. I mean, take -- take this -- this Court's decision in Helton versus Florida.
I think the question there was -- Mr. Liu, if you -- if you -- if you accept that, haven't you given up the ghost? Then we're just into deciding whether the application given these facts is or isn't reasonable diligence as a matter of law. I -- I -- I don't think so. I mean, I think in the -- in the -- Why are comas special? Well, they -- they very well might not be.
But I think it would be a declaration of a legal principle to say they weren't special. Just like in -- in Helton versus Florida when this Court said, you know, the Eleventh Circuit had applied an overly rigid rule regarding attorney misconduct, I understand that to be a legal principle. So how is -- So when -- -- that different from the case here, where at least one of the plaintiffs says binding circuit precedent made it unreasonable for me to file a motion to reopen and the Fifth Circuit said, no, you could have filed it earlier. That seems to me to be a pure legal question -- And -- and -- -- under your definition. -- and we don't understand the -- the Fifth Circuit to have even reached that issue.
That issue throughout this case has been teed up as an issue under the extraordinary circumstances prong. Well -- Then -- then, look, what I think everyone is trying to ask you, is Hurricane Katrina blows the courthouse away, okay, the standard is you have to file within 15 days.
But there is no courthouse.
It's blown to Florida. And so, question, was that, the standard says, an unusual circumstance? Writing, the court says, if it's an unusual circumstance, well, then it's extended.
All right? We agree Katrina blew the courthouse away.
But that isn't an unusual circumstance. Now, no review? Isn't that -- I mean, that's -- that's what we're trying to find out. There's no review.
And I -- No review, but, my goodness, if we look at the cases, I mean, then you've taken from the attorneys for the person who's trying to get review any kind of check through appeal on the action of a district judge. Now that's a -- I think it's pretty hard to find statutes that do that in a country that has a presumption of judicial review.
I think it's pretty difficult to read St. Cyr as saying that, when Congress made statutory what it thought was the standard of St. Cyr and included review of mixed questions of fact and law. So, I mean, if that's actually your position, it's unbounded, and -- and I -- I -- I don't get that. I think to determine what is reviewable and what is not under our position, you look at the type of analysis that's required to evaluate that claim.
So there are going to be certain claims that entail only a purely legal analysis. You look at the statute.
You interpret it.
There's no need to -- to have recourse to -- How is the -- -- a particular -- -- how is the Katrina hypo different from the coma hypothetical? You said one's reviewable and one's not reviewable, I think, if I heard you correctly. Well, I -- I think it's because, to answer the Katrina hypo, we would need to know more about the circumstances surrounding the storm and the particular circumstances of the litigant in trying to overcome -- What would you like to know? I'll tell you the courthouse is in Florida. (Laughter.) Well, but this is -- And the litigant, by the way, has never been able to walk more than one mile and his car has been blown up. Right.
But this is exactly my point.
I think those -- those facts are extremely helpful to answering the question. Oh -- And -- and -- and it's because I need those facts to answer the question. You do? I thought that your -- your answer was that at some point the factual mistake becomes so egregious that it reflects a misunderstanding of what exceptional means, rather than a misapplication of fact, which, correct me if I'm wrong, because that does lead into Justice Gorsuch's concern that, you know, you've kind of given up the game because then it's just a question of how exceptional is the fact. Right.
Now -- Which begins to look, once you say that, it begins to look like your standard application of law to fact. Right.
And I -- I -- Mr. Chief Justice, I wouldn't draw the line in terms of how egregious the error is.
I think that does invite the sort of review of the application of law to fact in order to determine whether there's been an error of law.
I think that's sort of a reverse-engineering end run around the statute. What I really mean to say is, if the question can be answered through purely legal analysis, then it is a pure question of law -- Well, all right, here is the difficulty.
That, I think, is really a difficult question.
I didn't think the other that I asked was so difficult.
But this one, I think, is. I mean, I learned years ago that you can absolutely distinguish the factual part of a missed -- of a mixed question from the legal part, and I also learned that no class is able to grasp my clear understanding of that. I also learned that there are many lawyers, and probably even more judges, that find that difficult.
And there are many cases that are mixed up in that respect.
Is it a coerced confession? Was there, in fact -- you know, there are loads of them. Okay.
Now the difficulty is that sometimes it's important and sometimes it isn't, and sometimes it's easy to separate out and sometimes it isn't. And so, rather than produce just a confusion in the lower courts and in the bar by saying the legal part is, but the factual part isn't, why not read this as saying, when they say questions of law, they mean to include mixed questions of fact and law and leave it at that, just as St. Cyr did, just as those statutes you quoted did, and that's the end of it.
Everyone can understand it. And, of course, if the district judge has discretion, well, then the right question of law will be did he abuse his discretion. Right.
Justice Breyer, we just don't think that's consistent with the text, the history of -- The text says questions of law.
And I can find statutes that use those words, and they clearly mean both, as they say. I -- I -- I -- I think -- I think that the best reference point for what questions of law means is 1254(2), which -- which this Court itself has applied in a pretty principled way to distinguish pure questions of law from mixed questions.
I mean, identifying pure questions of law is something appellate courts are quite used to doing. Now the phrase ""questions of law"" is like the term ""jurisdiction."" It's used -- it means lots of different things.
It's used sometimes rather sloppily, and it's asked for different purposes. So I -- I don't get anything out of the arguments on either side about what is meant by ""questions of law"" in general.
The question is what Congress meant here. I think -- Anyway, that's just a -- -- I -- I think it's fair to look at the context in which Congress looked -- wrote this statute.
As I said at the outset, I think the context here points in a very clear direction.
I mean, this was a Congress whose primary policy preference was to give criminal aliens no judicial review at all. Yeah.
And I think you have to bite the bullet on the -- the issue of the -- the hypotheticals about the comatose alien or the -- the alien who can't file because the courthouse has been blown away by a hurricane.
If -- if you posit a lower-level decision-maker who's either a monster or an idiot, then, of course, you're always going to think that there's a case for judicial review. Whenever judicial review is cut off, you open up the possibility that there's going to be a decision that would otherwise be reviewed that seems really, really wrong.
So you have to -- you have to make the argument that this is what Congress wanted.
And why would they have wanted that in this situation? And I think they would have wanted that because their goal all along, since 1996, is to -- is to expedite the removal of criminal aliens.
I think it's exactly -- But why did this -- But they expedite it, though, by -- by moving it to the court of appeals and taking the district court out, so that -- that -- Well, I think -- I think that's half the equation.
I think part of the expediting -- I mean, that's a year or more, you know, in many cases that's cut out by doing that.
So that's a significant saving of time. But I think -- I think that's only half -- half the equation.
The other half is in the types of decisions -- Right. -- that the courts of appeals would have to engage in.
And under my friend's -- On that -- on that -- on the context point that you were just referencing to, what about 1252(b)(9)? That seems important.
That's amended in the REAL ID Act, and that refers to a universe where you just have questions of law and questions of fact in this statute.
And if you look at that, it doesn't refer to mixed questions separately. The only thing excluded, arguably, the argument goes, is questions of fact. Well, I -- Everything else is a question of law and thus reviewable when you combine your stat -- this statute with (b)(9). I think (b)(9), which refers to all questions of law and fact, is just a natural way of referring to all three categories.
I mean, we -- we are talking about questions of law, mixed questions of law and fact, and questions of fact.
And so, to refer to all three at once, I think it's quite natural to say all questions of law and fact. Mr. Liu -- I think that's -- I'm sorry. I was just going to say I think that's -- that's all the zipper clause is doing, and I think the language there fits naturally with our argument. Mr. Liu, there is no question that we have a presumption in favor of judicial review, correct? Yes. Now you said that's a way of divining congressional intent. I don't actually think that because I think it's much broader than that.
It has to be a presumption that we will avoid what St. Cyr pointed to as a constitutional problem or a statutory problem because St. Cyr was saying very clearly the issuance of the writ was not limited to challenges to the jurisdiction of the custodian but encompassed the tensions based on errors of law, including the erroneous application or interpretation of the statute. And so, if we take that statement with the presumption, we know that Congress wasn't intending to remove judicial review altogether. It put this in the court of appeals, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed.
I'm not sure where I get the presumption that it was going to cut St. Cyr's concern in half by not including the application of -- of -- of law to settled facts. We don't -- we don't read that line in St. Cyr to be referring to the application of law to fact.
Rather, we read that line to be about the scope of a statute's coverage, in other words, its application. It begs -- it begs the question, doesn't it? Well, I -- I don't think -- Because you don't -- -- I don't think so.
I mean, if you -- if you use the Court's opinion in St. Cyr as its own dictionary, you'll see on page 293, the Court itself uses ""application"" to describe the pure question of law in that case. And then, in Part III, where the Court actually addresses that question, it uses the word ""apply"" or ""applied"" or ""application"" no fewer than 18 times to describe the retroactive application -- Except -- Mr. Liu, I think Justice Kagan had a question on the table. Have you finished? Yep.
Sure. Here's one way to look at this case: The text gets neither side all the way home; can't possibly.
The analogy is -- this is similar to Justice Alito -- they're really different contexts on both sides.
The legislative history is basically you can't -- you don't have a clue what it means.
St. Cyr can be read multiple ways. So all of those -- I mean, you have arguments and Mr. Hughes has arguments, and -- but none of them really seem to carry the day. And that suggests to me that the presumption of reviewability should carry the day.
Why isn't this the classic case in which -- it's like it's just not clear, and so the presumption does the work and you would lose. Well, to -- to answer your question directly, we do think it's -- it's a presumption of congressional intent.
We think that's reflected in the Block Nutrition case, but I -- I guess I -- maybe I'm just going to fight the premise.
I mean, we don't think Congress's intent is at all ambiguous here, that -- that we get to a point where you need to put a thumb on the scales in favor of judicial review. Well, I take that point.
I mean, that's why I asked about what's the nature of this presumption, because, if this presumption is only about congressional intent, it has to fight against a pretty strong sense that Congress wanted to do something significant here about cutting off review for criminal aliens. But, if this presumption is about more than that, if it's a presumption that sort of stands in for important separation of powers principles, then that response isn't quite good enough. Well, I -- I think at the end of the day, the presumption, if we know anything about it, it's -- it's not a -- a sort of magic words requirement.
And I -- I think this is a case where we know exactly what Congress was responding to.
We know the goal it ultimately wanted to achieve, and we know it wanted to achieve that goal as far as possible. And I -- I think there are good structural reasons to think my friend's reading is wrong.
The one is what I said at the outset, that -- that under my friend's reading, there really would be no meaningful difference between review in cases involving criminal aliens and review involving non-criminal aliens.
And if -- But suppose that you take that presumption, very interesting and deep question that I have, and maybe you have a view on this.
I have always thought that it is really basic.
It is the presumption that assures every person in the United States of America that this government will not harm that person in ways that are unlawful, unfair, arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, or an abuse of discretion, and that if you want to have a country that has a government that is under control, there is no better way. I'm not saying judges are perfect, but that separation of powers is designed to provide a check.
Do you see how basic I say it is? And I think the separation of -- And what do you think? I don't think the separation of powers is -- is a concern for us.
I mean, what Congress has done in this provision is preserve judicial review over the most important questions. Well, I -- I don't think that quite gets to Justice Breyer's question, in fairness.
Forget about the statute.
Isn't the presumption pretty ancient really? I mean, it goes back to the common law that the king can't act arbitrarily without some check, some review, some opportunity to be heard by citizens. Isn't that where the presumption really comes from? And isn't that pretty fundamental to the separation of powers and due process and those considerations? I don't dispute any of that. What -- what I would say is St. Cyr cashed out all those concerns in its constitutional avoidance holding -- Okay.
But -- but -- but you'd agree, though, that the presumption itself has those roots? That's -- that's fair enough, Justice Gorsuch, absolutely.
But I -- I would -- I would think that when Congress makes its intent clear that it wants to foreclose judicial review in those circumstances and go up to the limits that this Court identified, the constitutional doubts that this Court identified in St. Cyr, that Congress is able to do so. But Congress knew about this.
We know that from the ACLU objection and the back and forth and the deletion of ""pure."" And Congress could have easily written a statute that said review of questions of law, no review of facts or application of law to fact.
And it has used that kind of phrasing in other statutes.
That would have been the clear language that I think you're looking for. Well, I mean, I -- I think that -- that language would have been equally clear.
But I think Congress thought all it was doing was tracking this Court's concerns in St. Cyr, which were focused on the availability of judicial review for constitutional claims and pure questions of law. Now I -- I think the problem with my friend's position is it would -- it would reduce this difference.
And his only safety valve is to say: Well, some of these mixed application decisions would be discretionary and, therefore, not reviewable. Well, that -- that's just not how this statute works.
I mean, I think he's relying on 1252(a)(2)(B), which does say that discretionary denials are unreviewable.
But the questions of law, preservation, the saving clause here applies equally to 1252(a)(2)(B). And so I don't -- I don't think that's a solution to the problem.
You see this play out in the Ninth Circuit where they've read questions of law to include every mixed question of law and fact.
And what that's done is that it's gutted the application of the discretionary denial bar, because virtually everything that you can call an exercise of discretion you can also describe as involving the application of law to fact. And if questions of law are an exception to that bar, then you're -- you're not really left with -- with much that's -- that's protected from review.
So I -- I don't think that's a solution to -- to -- to trying to make this meaningful. I did want to mention, too, the -- the administrative -- administrability issue with Petitioners' position.
They would have this Court tell -- have courts of appeals start trying to distinguish questions of historical fact from mixed questions of law.
You know, of course, this Court has experience with that. I mean, pre-AEDPA, this was the regime because factual questions got a -- a lot of deference and mixed questions and legal questions didn't.
And there was a whole line of cases that this Court decided trying to put questions on one side of the line or the other. The line we're proposing, which is a -- a -- indeed, a pure questions line, I think my friend acknowledges is a clear line to administer, and it's one that appellate courts are well suited to administer and they have been doing in -- in -- in many other contexts. I -- I think -- Justice Gorsuch mentioned the -- the lay of the land in the courts of appeals.
It -- it's absolutely the case that all 10 courts of appeals that have addressed the standard of review that applies to the very issue here, that is, reasonable diligence for purposes of equitable tolling, for purposes of seeking to reopen removal proceedings, that determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion when this bar doesn't apply. And so Petitioners' reading would create a mismatch in one of two ways: Either we would be labeling as a question of law something that would otherwise be reviewed for abuse of discretion, or we would be reviewing de novo something that would otherwise be reviewed under a highly deferential standard. I -- I -- I don't think that that's really a tenable position.
I think what the -- what those cases teach us is that the issue here is at the very least a primarily factual mixed question. Mr. Liu, on that, the way I -- I worked my way through it, and I want to give you a shot at it, is to say that when we have the abuse of discretion standard review, we often mean really two things.
One can abuse the discretion by a clear error of fact finding, and one can abuse one's discretion by misapplying the law. And both of those can be abuses of discretion.
I -- I see it breaking down into -- into those two camps.
And when I'm applying the abuse of discretion -- when I used to apply the abuse of discretion standard review, and the facts were agreed upon, it then became in my mind a legal question much as it would at summary judgment or 12(b)(6), whether these facts, as given, rise to the level that the law requires. Now I -- I know you don't agree with that, so have your shot at it. Well, I think that inquiry is still -- requires a -- a great deal of exercise of judgment on behalf of whoever is conducting the inquiry.
You are taking in all the historical facts.
You're looking at them as a whole.
You're balancing one against the other.
There are judgments made throughout the process. So, you know, you might -- you might label it one thing or the other.
But I think when you get down to what the actual nature of the inquiry is, it is one that's bound up with the facts of the case. And I think the teaching of this Court's opinion in Lakeridge is that there is a part of a mixed question where you can't unwind the factual and the legal parts, that is, there is a part where they are so intertwined that the best you can say is, well, this is either primarily factual or primarily legal. It's those mixed questions that I don't think Congress was trying to give judicial review of because, if that were the case, there really wouldn't be any -- any difference between the review that the criminal aliens got and the review that the non-criminal -- You've mentioned -- -- aliens got. -- St. Cyr and Congress was just responding to that.
But isn't it true that the courts of appeals, in the wake of that decision, reviewed mixed questions before -- so after St. Cyr, before the Real ID Act? Well, only -- only four courts of appeals did.
I don't think that's a broad enough consensus for this Court to apply any sort of -- But Congress indicated it was -- at least a committee indicated awareness of those decisions. I don't think that's right. If you look at the passage of -- of the conference report on which Petitioners rely -- Well, put aside that.
Put aside that.
Is it -- go back to the courts of appeals decisions.
They had reviewed mixed questions -- Yeah. -- in that interim. Four of them had.
That's -- that's -- that's far from the sort of consensus, I think, Congress was focused on.
There's no indication Congress was aware of those decisions. And all those decisions rested on a reading of one line of St. Cyr, which, as I said, is mistaken.
I mean, if -- even if you look at the -- at the decision cited in that line, it's Footnote 18, you'll see that each of the sources cited involves a pure question of law that is a question of statutory construction. So I don't think the word ""application"" can -- can bear all that weight. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Hughes. Thank you, Your Honor. I'll -- I'll be brief. Our -- our first point is that because Congress created judicial review, that review must, in fact, be substantive.
It is not just review over whether or not the Board wrote down the right boilerplate.
We think that's an important starting point.
And when Congress created Section 2(D), it must have meant for more than just whether or not the Board used the right statement of the standard.
It must include whether or not that standard's used. The second point is jurisdictional rules, particularly rules like this that are often implied -- applied, have to be clear. There needs to be clear direction to the courts of appeals as to, at the outset of a case, when they have jurisdiction and when they don't have jurisdiction. The rule we've offered provides the Court a clear test. The government, by contrast, if we set aside its extreme position, the position that would be you look at the boilerplate only, there is no test the government has offered as to meaningfully distinguish between whether or not a standard was actually used and whether or not the standard was correctly applied. Because the courts need clarity, we think the rule that we offer is by far the most suitable and -- and appropriate rule that will allow courts to adjudicate these cases as they arise. Third and finally, if there is any doubt here, I think the presumption of judicial review is quite important.
This does bear not just on underlying congressional intent but core separation of powers principles. The view of, if there's going to be any delegation of lawmaking authority to the agencies, that certainly needs to be clearly stated by Congress.
So any doubt as to how the various statutory interpretation factors and the history in St. Cyr all apply, to the extent that that is a wash, we don't think it is, we think it strongly favors our position, but that would strongly favor applying the presumption and ultimately concluding that there is judicial review over the application of -- of lots of facts. So, ultimately, our rule is necessary to fulfill the promise of judicial review and the premise of judicial review that's undeniably created in the statutory text.
It's also required to be a fulsome response to St. Cyr, as the -- the cases in the wake of St. Cyr, as well as the pre-1789 cases that we identify in our briefs make clear.
There would be substantial Suspension Clause problems if the Court -- if Congress had not in the Real ID Act included the application of law to fact. But then, finally and ultimately, our rule is the one that is clear, that is manageable, that gives a workable test for the lower courts that will be applying this hundreds of times each year to know where jurisdiction starts and stops. And it's the one that's ultimately true to the presumption in favor of judicial review in the event of any ambiguity. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1678, Hernandez versus Mesa. Mr. Vladeck. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this case was first argued to this Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent and counsel for the United States were both asked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on U.S. soil when he was shot and killed by Respondent.
Both said yes. The question before this Court today is, therefore, whether a Bivens action is nevertheless foreclosed because, in this case, Sergio was standing a few feet to the Mexican side of the border at the time he was shot. For two reasons, we believe that it isn't.
First, the fortuity of where a victim is standing does not, in fact, trigger any of the special factors counseling hesitation identified by Respondent or the United States. Most importantly, it is difficult to see how foreign relations could be a special factor precluding a Bivens suit here if it wouldn't have precluded a Bivens claim had Sergio been standing just a few feet away. Moreover, the government's assertion that permitting Petitioners' suit would dramatically undermine U.S. foreign relations and diplomacy is belied by the long history of successful tort claims against federal law enforcement officers, including, as in the Apollon, cases in which the victim was a foreigner harmed on foreign soil, the Court awarded damages, and the diplomatic sky did not fall. Nor does extraterritoriality cut against a Bivens remedy here.
Not only was Respondent standing on U.S. soil when he pulled the trigger, but he could not have known in that instant where the bullet would even land, let alone the nationality of anyone it might hit. Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases. All of this goes to why this Court was right in Abbasi when it explained that there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens as a remedy for individual instances of law enforcement overreach.
And it goes to why, even though Sergio was standing on Mexican soil when he was shot and killed, this case presents the exact kind of law enforcement overreach that Abbasi had in mind. I think Abbasi is a useful place to begin our analysis because, in that case, not only did this Court suggest that there were still important reasons to retain Bivens in law enforcement contexts, but this Court itself actually preserved and retained one of the plaintiffs' Bivens claims.
This Court returned to the district court, rather than dismissing, the prisoner abuse claim against the warden of the MDC. And we think that reflects four of the reasons why retaining Bivens in the law enforcement sphere makes sense.
First, as this Court said in Abbasi, it is difficult to contemplate other remedies when individual instances of law enforcement overreach are at play.
In those contexts, a damages action after the fact will usually be the only possible legal recourse.
It's going to be difficult to bring a claim in advance. Second, the deterrence effect, what this Court has called the core purpose of Bivens, which is to deter individual officers, could quite easily be lost in the absence of remedies in the law enforcement context, unlike in Abbasi, where, as this Court stressed, there were alternative remedies available to the plaintiffs. Third, the historical tradition that we note in our brief, where federal courts and state courts, going all the way back to the founding, routinely imposed tort damages against federal officers acting ultra vires, without suggesting there were separation-of-powers obstacles to doing so, without suggesting that there was anything wrong with the federal courts providing a cause of action in those cases. As opposed to, I think, where the inquiry historically has focused, immunity.
Are there reasons in these cases to actually hold the -- the defendant officer harmless, not because there's no cause of action but because he was acting in good faith or, under the modern standard, because he did not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable officer in his position would have been aware. They argue -- If the -- Go ahead. If the officer in this case had been a state officer and everything else was the same, would the victim have a claim in federal court? So, if the question is in federal court, Justice Alito, I think it would depend on diversity.
I don't believe the victim would be able to bring a claim under 1983 because, as the government points out, the language of that statute limits the class of plaintiffs to U.S. citizens and those subject to the jurisdiction thereof. But, Justice Alito, Congress, when it enacted 1983, as Judge Prado noted in his dissent below, was not thinking about limiting remedies that were otherwise available; it was thinking about expanding remedies, in that context in 1871, to newly freed slaves. So 1983 does nothing to displace whatever state tort remedies might be available against state officers.
Now, of course, that's going to vary a bit. Suppose -- suppose there were no 1983, and a state officer had done exactly what the Bureau of Narcotics agents did in Bivens.
Would there be an action against the state officer? There would be, Justice Ginsburg.
And, actually, I think it's worth in this context reminding the Court of the government's position in Bivens.
The government's position in Bivens itself was not that the federal courts should not be recognizing these remedies in any context. Rather, the government's position in Bivens was that New York State tort law would have provided an adequate remedy, Justice Ginsburg, not just against the federal officer defendants in Bivens but also had they been, say, New York City police officers, that New York trespass law would have provided the remedy. To quote from the government's brief in Bivens, a federal remedy should only be recognized when it is necessary.
And the argument in Bivens was simply as to whether a complementary federal remedy was necessary to vindicate the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights, given the existence of New York trespass law, given the government's argument that New York trespass law in that context was adequate to vindicate the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment interests. And this was the common law model.
I mean, I think we are all familiar with Henry Hart's dialectic where Professor Hart suggested that the original understanding was that even federal officers would be principally responsible to judges in state court.
There was no general federal question statute. Your -- your -- you reference the government's position in Bivens.
That was almost 50 years ago.
In the interim, there's been a fairly dramatic change in how we approach things as implying causes of action, both under statutes and under Bivens. I mean, it's been, what, 40 years, right, since the last time we recognized a cause of action in Bivens? So I -- I -- I think you need to sort of move up half a century and explain to us why we should take your -- your approach today regardless of what the -- the prevailing legal regime was in '71. I take the point, Mr. Chief Justice, and if I may offer two points in response.
The first is I say all of this by way of putting Bivens in context.
That is to say that, rather than a bolt from the blue, Bivens was a continuation of this tradition. But, to -- to wind the clock forward, which I think is, of course, the -- the task for the Court today, I think it's worth stressing that, of the nine cases this Court has decided since Carlson, which the government points out at page 11 of its amicus brief, where this Court has had the opportunity to recognize a Bivens remedy and has chosen not to do so, none of those involved a claim that an individual federal law enforcement officer was acting ultra vires.
None of the suits involved the kind of claim we have here.
None of the suits involved the context in which this historical tradition was at its richest, Mr. Chief Justice.
None of the suits or at least not all of the cases even involved claims that would have had a common law parallel. And so we certainly recognize that this Court has been increasingly skeptical of judge-made causes of action in general and of Bivens in particular.
Our point is simply that that skepticism has been reserved or at least focused on categories unlike this one. If Bivens were a statute, in effect, we would apply the presumption against extraterritorial application.
And the other side argues that, therefore, even if it were a statute, it wouldn't apply in a circumstance like this. What's your answer to that? Well, I think we have two answers, Justice Kavanaugh.
And I think the -- the first and most important is that but Bivens is not a statute and that this Court has never suggested, for example, that in looking at whether particular constitutional provisions apply extraterritorially, we would use any of the typical presumptions that we apply to statutes because it is a fundamentally different task from the perspective of looking at the extent to which the Constitution applies overseas versus what Congress would have intended. But even if this Court, nevertheless, believes that it's appropriate to map on that presumption, I actually think Kiobel helps us more than it hurts us, because, in Kiobel, this Court said there will still be cases in which the -- the underlying conduct, the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint, involves activity that touches and concerns U.S. soil with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality. And so I think this Court could assume without deciding that extraterritoriality is a special factor for purposes of Bivens and still say this case is different because Respondent was standing on U.S. soil at the time he pulled the trigger, that is touching and concerning U.S. territory from my perspective the way Kiobel meant it. What would distinguish -- But the -- the -- the victim, Hernandez, this Court has -- has said, I think, that a non-citizen who's injured abroad doesn't have any Fourth Amendment rights. So what is -- it seems like a rather arid discussion if, at the end of the day, there is no federal constitutional right that can be asserted by a non-citizen who is injured abroad. So I think -- I think, Justice Ginsburg, that Verdugo certainly stands for the proposition that in that case there was no Fourth Amendment protection for a Mexican national whose home was searched by DEA agents operating in conjunction with the Mexican government. I think this Court itself suggested in Hernandez I, two years ago, that the Fourth Amendment question in the context of a cross-border shooting is more complicated, and it is the fact that that question is unsettled -- Well, what -- -- that is -- sorry. -- what -- this is my question, too.
I want to pick up on Justice Ginsburg. What -- what then is the limiting principle? We have a foreign national injured abroad by an action in the United States. I can think of a lot of cases that that's going to encompass, right? And not just cross-border shootings but all kinds of torts that can occur transnationally.
Would you capture all of those or -- or -- Not at all, Justice Gorsuch.
And as I hope was clear -- It can't -- it can't be that this is good for one shooting only, right? No.
And, first, I mean, I think -- I think this Court is well aware that there's been more than one shooting, so -- I understand that. But -- but no, I mean, I think the -- the larger point is our position focuses on the law enforcement nature of the conduct at issue here. And so many of the hypotheticals that I suspect you are thinking of, Your Honor, that I'd be thinking of, for a context in which a U.S. government person in the United States could -- Why would it be limited to law enforcement as opposed to other governmental functions that happen here but happen to injure persons abroad? Because I think it's in the law enforcement context that there is the strongest argument, the strongest appeal to the historical tradition we note in our briefs, where there is a straight line dating all the way back to the founding where it was law enforcement, where common law remedies against federal officers were so important. There aren't many examples, I could find none, of combat operations, for example, where state courts were imposing tort remedies against federal officers. So you'd have us -- you'd draw a line there, actively in this case and say that any -- any actions involving military operations, diplomatic operations, any other operations of government are not -- there -- there's no Bivens action there, it's only for law enforcement, whatever that means, operations? So, I mean, I -- obviously, I wouldn't decide more than is necessary.
But I do think -- Ah, ah, okay. That's what -- that's what I thought you'd say. But -- but, Justice Gorsuch -- All right.
And so -- so where is, if -- if you're not willing to draw that line, where is it? And how is this Court supposed to draw it? You -- you say -- you say you could say this, but I wouldn't say it.
All right. I -- I -- I -- Where would you draw the line? I think -- I think based on this Court's jurisprudence, and based on Abbasi itself, I think the line could reasonably, plausibly, and -- No, no, not reasonably, plausibly.
Where would you have this Court draw the line? Well, I think, frankly, there are decisions this Court has handed down in the Bivens context that I think don't necessarily -- aren't necessarily consistent with this full tradition. But it has still left open law enforcement conduct, Justice Gorsuch.
And it's not just this Court that has done that. Congress, in the 1974 amendment to the Federal Tort Claims Act, went out of its way to expand the liability of the United States for intentional torts committed by law enforcement officers. Well -- They are -- -- but I -- it's not just intentional torts.
It's rogue intentional torts.
That's an important limiting principle. It absolutely is, Justice Sotomayor.
And I hope it's clear in our briefs -- And accepting the facts of this case, the use of force is on U.S. land and it's unreasonable because the claim is that this young man was doing nothing but standing on the other side of the border. And I think this might be a -- a -- sort of a more convincing answer, I hope, to Justice Gorsuch, which is I do believe that it is relevant to the claim and the strength of our claim in this case that the Respondent was, according to the plausible allegations in the plaintiff's complaint, violating not just the Constitution but his own departmental regulations, that we have not just a law enforcement officer, Justice Gorsuch, but a law enforcement officer acting ultra vires. Are we supposed to decide this? I mean, I thought -- I wrote a dissent, I guess, but I thought this is special because it's American law enforcement, American soil, and he thought he might be shooting at an American, and the -- the border in this case is rather special, it's not just the line, it was the river, and it's administered by an international commission, dah-dah-dah, okay, I have about six wonderful reasons that persuaded only me.
Okay. But the -- (Laughter.) Or now -- now -- I believe you also persuaded -- -- I thought we're taking this case on the assumption that the Fourth Amendment does apply, and the only issue in front of us is not that but, rather, we assume that the Fourth Amendment applied, that it is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment, and the question is Abbasi, whether there is a Bivens action for a clear rogue violation of the Fourth Amendment that takes place in the way this does. Is that sufficient, to use the Abbasi term that -- which I've now lost, but the Abbasi term that this is some kind of extension of the Fourth Amendment or that this is some kind of special situation? That, I thought, was the issue. And at some point, I -- I feel, I'll try to answer that question, but I'd like to hear what you say about that. I -- I -- I agree completely, Justice Breyer.
I mean, I think that Abbasi -- I don't think Abbasi -- I don't care whether you agree or not.
All I want to hear is your argument on -- I don't want to repeat myself -- but on the assumptions I gave -- Yes. -- what is your argument that this is not an extension, that this is not special, that this is not an unusual thing? I understand. What's your argument? So our argument is, first, that this Court has long recognized that claims against individual law enforcement officers for excessive force are what the Fifth Circuit called classic Bivens claims. I believe there's an opinion by then Judge Kavanaugh referring to it as the core of Bivens to bring a claim that an individual law enforcement officer is acting ultra vires. So, Justice Breyer, I think there's at least an argument that this might not even be a new context.
But, even if it is a new context, the government and Respondent have identified three special factors that they argue counsel hesitation. First, they say it's because this case implicates foreign relations and national security.
As we suggest in our briefs, we don't believe that follows simply from the fact that Sergio Hernandez was standing on the Mexican side of the border as opposed to the American side of the border. The government also argues extraterritoriality as a special factor.
As I think I hope I explained in response to Justice Kavanaugh's question, we don't think extraterritoriality is implicated here because this case touches and concerns U.S. territory with sufficient force to displace the presumption. And the third extra -- the third special factor invoked by Respondent and the government is congressional action.
And I think, in that context, there's no example of Congress specifically trying to preclude claims like Petitioners here. And the only time Congress has ever spoken to the tort liability of, again, Justice Gorsuch, this is where we get our test from, individual federal law enforcement officers, Congress has expanded that liability. Counsel -- Tell me -- -- just to go with the first of the things you mentioned, the international relations, there has been diplomatic correspondence between the Mexican government and our government with respect to this -- this -- this incident. The Border Patrol has conducted an investigation, and it reached the determination that the action of the agent was not contrary to policy. And you would have the courts look into this by avail -- providing a Bivens remedy that could well come to the opposite conclusion. So that in terms of our relations with Mexico, we'd have one agency saying this was not inconsistent with policy.
We'd have the court saying it is. And that is the type of thing that it makes it at least a -- a new context.
You can say it doesn't make a difference, but, in terms of our relations with Mexico, they've got two different things, and at least with respect to foreign relations, I thought the country was supposed to speak with one voice. So I do -- I certainly agree that the -- that the country is supposed to speak with one voice, Mr. Chief Justice.
Two -- two points in response.
The first is, of course, if the government continues to believe and if Respondent continues to believe there would be a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had simply been standing on American soil, it's not clear to me why the same concerns wouldn't be equally present. That is to say, by that logic, any time a U.S. officer harms any foreign national, even if Bivens itself -- if Bivens had been a foreign national, it's not hard to imagine similar diplomatic correspondence following from that incident. They argue it's not merely the foreign policy implications that the Chief Justice identified but that border security is also national security in some respects and that that's a different context, slightly different than the foreign relations. Can you address that? Absolutely.
And we certainly agree that border security as a policy is an important policy of the United States, that if we were here challenging one of the government's border patrol policies, this would be a different case. But I think it's important to note, back to the Chief Justice's question, that the dispute here is over whether Respondent violated the very government policy at issue.
That is to say, we are not challenging a policy of the government.
We are claiming Respondent himself did not comply with that policy. The government's entitled, Mr. Chief Justice, to its own preliminary determination of that question.
We don't think it is the kind of policy to which this Court has historically accorded deference in the foreign relations and national security sphere, if it's an after-the-fact factual determination about a single incident, as opposed to, say, a challenge to an entire border patrol policy. I thought you were challenging the -- Can you go back to -- -- I thought you were challenging the constitutionality of what was done, not whether it was consistent with border patrol policy. So, Justice Alito -- Is that -- is that -- does that provide the basis for a federal claim? If it were -- if you put the Fourth Amendment aside, but the action was contrary to border -- border patrol policy, would that provide the basis for a federal claim? Not for a damages suit, of course, but -- Yes. -- but it is our position, Justice Alito, that -- just to go back to my colloquy with Justice Gorsuch, again, the reason why we believe this is in the heartland of Bivens, notwithstanding the concerns that the Chief Justice has referred to and that Justice Kavanaugh alluded to, is because, here, we do not have a case where the claim is that a particular policy of the United States in the foreign relations or national security sphere was the source of the injury to the plaintiffs. Here, our argument is that the policy is actually coextensive with the Constitution, and so that if we are correct, which we have not yet, of course, had a chance to prove, but if we are correct that Respondent violated Petitioner's constitutional -- or Sergio Hernandez's constitutional rights, Justice Alito, there would also be a violation of policy. And so, to us, the questions blend together because it helps to drive home why this case is not like the nine cases this Court has had since Carlson -- Can -- can we -- can we go back to the question that I asked? If breaking into someone's home and searching and seizing, if that's not a Fourth Amendment violation because the person is a non-citizen and it happened abroad, you said a cross-border shooting is more complicated.
Why should it be different? So, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, I actually think it was this Court that said that in Hernandez I.
And I think the reason why is because there is some uncertainty in the lower courts, as reflected in the Ninth Circuit's decision in the Rodriguez case, the original three-judge panel decision in this case. There is some uncertainty about just how broadly this Court's decision in Verdugo-Urquidez, in which the Court said a Mexican national could not invoke the Fourth Amendment to challenge the search of his home -- the warrantless search of his home by a DEA officer, there's uncertainty about how far that sweeps.
Is that a categorical on/off switch at the border, or are there reasons to actually think the Fourth Amendment question is more complicated in the context in which you have cross-border episodes, especially after Boumediene? And that is say, does Verdugo still have the same force? Now -- Mr. Vladeck, there is one part of the Chief's question you didn't answer.
The government's speaking with one voice, and you said the government should.
But he's posited a big difference here.
The government -- the executive has said this was not a rogue action.
This security guard. They've concluded on -- based on what, we don't know -- that this officer was being attacked and that's why he shot.
The allegations of this complaint are to the contrary. If the court were to rule in favor of your client -- not the court, but a jury were to have found in favor of your client, wouldn't we be speaking in two voices? You haven't addressed that. Thank you, Justice Sotomayor.
And I think our response is I think that this Court has never suggested that every single thing the United States says that has any bearing on any possible sliver of foreign relations is the kind of foreign policy where this Court has said the -- the government should be allowed to speak with one voice. And so I think there's a meaningful distinction between a policy that is ex ante shaping the conduct of our border patrol officers, of our government officers, where a judicial decision might call into question the policy, and a context where the dispute rises and falls on whether the government's own policy prohibiting excessive force in violation of the Constitution was violated.
That is to say, it seems to me that there's merger. But what if, Mr. Vladeck, you had -- you have this one incident and the executive branch had a very different view of what happened than a court did? A court said there was unconstitutional conduct here, the use of excessive force.
But the executive branch thought he did everything by the book, and, you know, he isn't subject -- he shouldn't be subject to any action, even a disciplinary one. And then the court's decision, contrary to that -- let's say Mexico wants to extradite the border patrol officer.
And that puts, I would think, the executive branch in a quite difficult situation.
Should -- you know, Mexico is pointing at a court judgment, but the executive branch thinks that there's no earthly reason to extradite.
What happens then? Well, I think, Justice Kagan, there's a critical difference between what the preclusive effect of a civil judgment about the unconstitutional conduct by the officer would prove and whether the Mexican government would be able to satisfy the very different inquiry of whether there's sufficient evidence to sustain a criminal indictment and to warrant extradition under the terms of the U.S./Mexico extradition treaty. And I think that's the key point here, is that, on the government's logic, all it takes is the government showing up after an incident and saying, oh, there's some reason why we don't believe this was unlawful or there's some foreign relations implication to a judgment holding it's lawful.
And if it's after the fact, that won't matter; it would still preclude Bivens. Well, that's, I think, a fairly unfair characterization of what the government did in this case.
According to their representations, it was a fairly thorough investigation. And maybe it's -- at the end of the day, maybe a jury would come to a different determination than the governmental investigation, but I don't think that's fully responsive to the international relations concerns. That -- that's fair that you ask -- But, even if not fully responsive, it has to be demonstrated it's simply a new context for the Bivens question. That -- that may well be, and I think our submission is simply that the question this Court has always suggested in the Bivens context is how to preserve its core deterrent purpose, and in a context in which the government's after-the-fact factual determination that an officer had acted appropriately under the circumstances were sufficient to be a policy choice, that does not actually give rise to the kind of deference this Court has historically accorded. Right? That's what we're worried about because it's not clear how that wouldn't potentially, if not in this case, swallow the category, right? That is to say, if Abbasi meant what it said when it said there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens in the law enforcement context, we think that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, even when the government has other -- other equities at stake. Because, again, the key for us is when a court is saying an individual officer has acted ultra vires, it is not the same thing as saying the government's policy is somehow inconsistent with the Constitution. It's not the same thing as saying we are second-guessing how the government has chosen to conduct border patrol policies.
It's simply saying this one officer went out of bounds.
And that's the kind of claim that was historically available at common law.
It's the kind of claim Congress preserved in the FTCA amendment. And if I may, I think the -- the point of Abbasi at the end of the day is to draw the distinction between the kind of claim this Court rejected, which was a high-level challenge to post-9/11 policies formulated by the attorney general and the FBI director, and the individual law enforcement officer engaged in overreach. Thank you, counsel. Mr. -- Mr. Ortega. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioners are asking this Court to create a cause of action, an implied cause of action, where none has existed since the formation of our republic, by extending Bivens in a new context, where Congress has not -- has declined to provide a remedy.
And Congress's silence is telling.
They've addressed this issue in the FTCA, which bars foreign claims. They've addressed it again in the Alien Tort Statute.
And they addressed it again in Westfall, that carved out an exception for Bivens. The new context in this case is not only the transnational aspect but also the utilization of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.
The new context itself fails, and the argument that there's a lack of a remedy fails when the Court takes into consideration the special factors that are involved in this case: intruding on the separation of powers, where Congress and the executive have their domain; national security -- and border patrol is national security. The border patrol is the forefront of our national security.
The border patrol, much like the military, is a paramilitary organization charged with protecting our borders.
Congress has chosen, and non-inadvertently, not to create a damages remedy. And if a damages remedy is appropriate, it is the unique domain of Congress to consider the public policy, to balance the projected costs.
And it requires an assessment of its impact system-wide. The executive is in charge of foreign affairs.
There's an actual dispute in this case as Mexico would like a remedy and the United States has argued against a remedy.
Mexico -- If we can go back to the -- this complaint, and at this stage, this very preliminary stage, we're supposed to accept the complaint's allegations as true, which is that, here, we have a rogue officer acting in violation of the agency's own instruction, using excessive force to kill a child at play, how does that call into question any foreign policy or national security policy? Well, it would create a chilling effect as to the border patrol agents in conducting their day-to-day activities, but not only a chilling effect, you would be -- the lower courts would be in chaos.
There would be -- Well, doesn't that happen if the shooting happened in our own land? Meaning a border patrol agent who sees a child at play and kills him two feet from the line is not chilled.
He knows he can't do that. What makes it chilling to tell a border patrol agent don't shoot indiscriminately at children standing a few feet from the border? We have to accept the facts of the complaint on their face. That's correct. All right.
On their face, the complaint says that's what the border agent did. But -- but you can't view it in a vacuum.
It would be applicable -- Well, the vacuum -- what -- this doesn't involve a Mexican defendant, Mexican law, or Mexican courts.
It involves a U.S. defendant acting on U.S. soil, pulling the trigger on U.S. soil, and subject to U.S. law.
We're not dragging the border patrol agent into a Mexican court. So how would we be interfering? Your Honor, are you -- are you suggesting that the decedent would be inside of the border of the United States? No, I just said to you it involves a U.S. defendant, the border patrol agent, acting on U.S. soil, pulling the trigger on U.S. soil, and subjecting the U.S. border agent to a U.S. court. But the -- We're not dragging the agent anywhere else. That's correct, but the agent would know when he took his actions that he was inside of the jurisdiction of the United States. He always knows he's inside and subject to U.S. law.
Don't -- that never changes no matter what we do here. That's correct.
But, in this case, you're asking for -- the Petitioners are asking for an extension of the Constitution into a foreign republic, which is quite -- We assume -- we assume here that it is extended.
We assume the Fourth Amendment applies, my understanding is. So we know this place by picture. It's a culvert.
It's a big culvert like here to the end of the room.
And there's a bridge.
And across this bridge, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people walk each day on their way to work or on their way home. Now a border agent who's standing near the bridge picks up a gun and shoots one of them.
If he's crossed that imaginary line in the center of the bridge, I take it, you agree that you can bring a Bivens action? That's correct. And if he is an American and on the other side, you agree he can bring a Bivens action? That would be correct, Your Honor. Okay.
So the only person who cannot bring a Bivens action -- and the border agent has no idea whether he's shooting such a person -- is someone who is just on the Mexican side of the imaginary line on the bridge and whom he shot deliberately or roguely or whatever. That would be correct, but -- See, all right, now here is the standard.
Justice Kennedy writes it.
The necessary inference is that the -- the necessary -- the inquiry that we're after about whether this is an extension of a Bivens action, must concentrate on whether the judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action, to weigh the costs and benefits of allowing the action to proceed, okay? That's my standard.
I've given you the facts.
What's the problem? We would like -- we ordinarily have such actions.
The Mexicans want it.
They want the action.
So what's the special problem? It would become a matter of line drawing.
Where would the court -- No, no, not line drawing.
There's no line drawing problem.
We assume -- the line drawing problem may come in as to whether the Fourth Amendment applies, but, here, we're assuming it does.
And assuming it applies, what's the problem with the Bivens action? What's the line drawing problem there? It would be the extending of Bivens into a new country. Why is it extending? I mean, after all, maybe in Hawaii there's never been a Bivens action brought before on the 14th island.
Is that an extension? It's not.
It's within the United States.
Here, we have -- Oh, I understand that.
And this is on the other side of the line.
Also, by the way, it was at 7:00 in the evening, in fact, 7:02.
And there never has been a Bivens action brought at 7:02. But there's never been a Bivens action that involves a transnational shooting. Ah, I got that point. All I am saying is, why is that different in terms of a problem caused than the fact that it was 7:02:59 on the fourth island of Hawaii? You got my point? I do. Good.
All right.
He got it.
Now what's -- what is it? It's -- it's -- (Laughter.) Don't ask my point. I want to know your answer. I have to go back to -- to it being different in so much as it is transnational.
And it -- Well, you've said that.
All I'm asking you is why that makes a difference? Where it's on a bridge, in the culvert, the -- I won't repeat myself, but I went through every factor I thought that I could -- seems to me very, very similar, and I just don't understand it. So far, what you've said is: It will freeze the border patrol, to which I think good. I don't think there's an American who -- anywhere in the world who wouldn't want to stop the kind of action here, so that doesn't seem a factor cutting against. And, anyway, he can do it if it's an American, and he doesn't even know if it's an American. If there was a remedy to be fashioned, that would be for Congress to decide. That's a conclusion. And my answer -- my question is, why? Because they'll be able to weigh the costs and benefits of the actual remedy itself, the limits of the remedy, the parameters of the remedy for the courts to be able to provide guidance to the lower courts. There would be very little guidance to the lower courts -- I -- I don't understand your answer.
You can't shoot an unarmed juvenile playing.
And the remedies limit is that one.
That -- that's the only thing that a court would be deciding, whether there truly was cause or no cause for this shooting. But -- but then wouldn't the -- the determination would be on an ad hoc basis, creating instability in the lower courts. Why? What's the greater instability when you already admit that Bivens -- Bivens would apply if that child was standing two feet from the border? And it even would apply, according to you, if it was an American child standing two feet on the Mexican border.
I don't see where the greater instability arises in that situation. Well, the instability would rise because of the -- the actual areas where you're at.
It's a national border with the border patrol providing national security in that area. So why -- what you're basically saying is Bivens shouldn't apply ever against a border -- a rogue border patrol who just stands there shooting people both on the U.S. side, indiscriminately, takes a gun and just sweeps both sides of the border? Well, it would apply to those standing on the United States side certainly. Well -- Let -- let me ask because I'm putting all my -- this is actually bothering me.
I'm not asking you to -- look, if we were talking about extending the Fourth Amendment, I would see a problem.
I might think we should or I might think we shouldn't, but I might think we should, but I certainly would say there is a problem. But, once we say the Fourth Amendment is there in just the same way it is two feet on the other side, at that point, what's the special problem of giving a damages remedy to a Mexican youth just as you would give it to an American youth, whether that American youth is over on one side of the border or the other? Assuming -- That's where I -- that's -- at that point, I hesitate.
I say, well, that's what we're supposed to find here under the statute.
And -- and what is it? Assuming Verdugo did not foreclose that, then there would not be a difference. Well, if there's no difference, then that's the end of it, isn't it, because Kennedy says, look, he says, you've got to find -- he's not talking about the Fourth Amendment.
He's actually not even thinking about that, possibly.
I don't know.
We're thinking about Sixth Amendment, Eighth, Tenth Amendment.
I don't know.
But -- but assuming he is, once we're there, the Fourth Amendment really does apply. You say you can't think of a difference.
And I can't think of a difference. So we send the case back.
Now consider the Fourth Amendment. Consider the Fourth -- Is that what we should do? Well, the Fourth Amendment, I believe, is foreclosed by Verdugo in its language claiming that a U.S. agent, even acting on foreign soil, is not constrained by the Fourth Amendment. I thought your -- I'm not sure -- I thought your point was the foreign policy implications are triggered when it's on the other side of the border, and that's why we give significance to the border, but I want to press on that because wouldn't there be foreign policy implications even if the victim were a Mexican -- Mexican national and killed even on the U.S. side of the border? Those kinds of incidents create lots of international and foreign policy implications as well. So why do foreign policy implications track the border so neatly in your view? They track the border because the border is a paramilitary area that the border patrol patrols under the guidance of the executive. But do you agree there could be serious foreign policy implications even from a incident inside the United States with a victim who's a Mexican national? Absolutely, just the way that there were in this case dealing with the extradition and the damage -- damages remedy asked for by the Mexican government and the U.S. government deciding -- or opposing their request for a damages remedy. So it's been 40 years and there's been no extension of Bivens beyond the trilogy that this Court has -- has outlined.
The presumption against the extension provides the lower courts stability versus an ad hoc application of the law. Should we think about the lack of alternative remedies? Mr. Vladeck mentioned that, there's just no remedy at all, which is unlike not all the Bivens cases but certainly some of them? But, when you look at the myriad of special factors, including the separation of powers, national security, foreign diplomacy, public policy, and the projected costs, I think that that creates quite a different -- a different picture of that.
And it's better left for Congress and the executive to decide those issues and, specifically, Congress to balance the public policy, the limits of the law, and to provide guidance for this Court to interpret an actual statute that they would have created. I believe the new context of this nature in a transnational shooting should be dispositive.
An injury to a foreign national on foreign soil is untenable because excessive force that relates to a seizure, as we've discussed, is covered by the Fourth Amendment and is not a substantive due process claim. It would require an extension of Boumediene to a foreign country where the U.S. maintains no jurisdiction whatsoever, whether de facto or actual.
It would create line drawing. It would create an unpredictable application. Even if this Court were to fashion a damages remedy, the application of that remedy would be very difficult and would create chaos, in my opinion, of the lower courts in its very application. Why -- why chaos? I guess I'm not seeing that.
You would just extend it and it would apply just like Bivens applies to lots of cases all the time. Well, it would be line drawing, wouldn't it? The line drawing of the border, extension of the border. Well, Justice Sotomayor gave you the line.
You have a defendant on U.S. soil who's a U.S. official. Well, if he's on -- if they're in -- And then you just look -- -- the United States, there's no question -- -- and then you just look at the actions to see whether it was excessive force.
I guess I'm -- I take your point on the new context, but I guess the chaos argument's not resonating with me. The lower courts have stood on this Court's presumption against the extension in order to provide stability and guidance to them in their decisions. Extending it again and extending it transnationally would create a myriad of problems. Mr. Ortega, I think I'm a little bit confused.
Do you or do you not contest -- suppose there were a -- a border patrol officer used excessive force but 10 miles from the border while carrying out border security operations. Ten miles from the border inside of the United States? Yeah, he's a border patrol officer, he's acting within the scope of his employment, it's very important, he's trying to find people who have crossed the border. He's engaged in, you know, usual law enforcement work. Can you bring a Bivens action against that officer? The injury is occurring in the United States or outside of the United States? You know -- yes, it's -- it's -- it's in the United States, but this is border patrol work.
This is border work. This is border security work. Well, you can bring the Bivens action if he was actually a rogue officer acting outside of policy, which does not present itself here. Well, yeah -- I mean, if -- if -- if we are assuming that the officer used excessive force, you can bring the Bivens action, is that correct? If it fell outside the policy, correct.
Excessive force. Okay.
Now we're bringing it 10 miles up to the border, except the person involved -- this is Mr. Vladeck's hypo -- is -- is on the U.S. side of the border. Still a Bivens action? Inside of the -- the United States border, correct. Okay.
So a lot of foreign affairs concerns are present there, so too a lot of national security concerns, if we're saying that border security is a facet of national security, right? Correct. Okay.
So then the question is why, when we just moved three inches over, there's a different answer? That, I think, is the question that many people have been asking you. That's correct.
And I believe that the border is real.
It's a real line.
And it can't be extended.
The Constitution cannot be extended into a foreign country.
But -- Yes, it is a real line.
And, you know, one way to line-draw is find a real line, I suppose. (Laughter.) But I guess, you know, usually, the -- the -- the analysis that we go through in a Bivens claim -- and I think that this is the analysis that the government wants us to go through -- is to ask about, are there special foreign affairs concerns? Are there special national security concerns? And the question is, why would there be special foreign affairs and national security concerns with respect to a shooting that occurs three inches on one side of the border versus three inches on the other side of the border or even a little bit away from the border but very much involving border security work? If it keeps going, extending into Mexico, then there would be no line.
It would just keep going and going.
It could be all of Juarez, it could be all of Chihuahua, it could be all of Mexico.
It would never end.
It would be no different than a drone pilot in Colorado hitting the wrong village in Syria.
He would still be -- Well, I think we're positing a defendant who is in the United States and who is committing his action in the United States.
So, unless this is a very far-reaching bullet, I don't think so. That's correct.
And that was the -- the hypothetical I gave you regarding a drone pilot in Colorado who happens to hit a village in Syria.
It would be the same action. He would be in the United States, the victims would be in Syria, the injury would -- would occur in Syria. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A foreign national was killed on foreign soil by a federal officer patrolling an international border.
That is plainly a new context for Bivens purposes, and several special factors counsel hesitation here: clear foreign relations concerns with Mexico and the need for border security, clear extraterritoriality, and clear signals from Congress in 1983 and the FTCA that it does not approve of damages liability for injuries abroad. Taking a step back, Abbasi and other decisions have made lower courts markedly less willing to imply causes of action for damages. If this Court extends Bivens here, on these facts, it will threaten to reverse that trend by undermining this Court's consistent message about the importance of caution and judicial modesty in this area. To turn to the first of the three special factors, the foreign relations with Mexico, I don't think it's difficult to figure out exactly why we think Congress might pause, as it has in 1983 and the FTCA, before extending damages liability here. The United States and Mexico have an active disagreement over what happened here.
We have bilateral mechanisms for working it out, like the Border Violence Prevention Council, which meets and talks about things like use of force. When we are conducting those negotiations, if we are taking positions about what has happened at the border and courts -- Mr. Wall, the problem is that the allegation here is not about their meeting and talking about policies.
It's about rogue actions. And -- and I take a look at the amici, the former, like the CPB, but others who tell me pretty persuasively and extensively that the border patrol might be a bit of a mess and that disciplining is at a minimum here, investigating, et cetera, is not done in the way that others of us would think would be appropriate to an agency. All of those things suggest to me that the class you want to create is a class of border patrol agents, whether they shoot across the border or shoot in the border. Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy to go through all the reports and the evidence.
I'm happy to say, look, there were 55 incidents of use of force with firearms in fiscal year '12.
There were 15 last year in fiscal year '18.
That's a more than 70 percent drop. We can go back and forth about whether we think the Customs and Border Patrol is doing a good job at the border or not. I think my bottom line point, though, is that all of that is the subject of legislative debate.
There is a body that can consider these kinds of questions and tailor a damages scheme to whatever -- But that -- -- the facts on the -- -- that would mean -- -- ground are, but -- But that would have been -- -- that's Congress. -- that would have been true in Bivens itself.
Someone could have said there are all sorts of things that control the FBI, and we shouldn't extend Bivens, but we did because there's a fundamental belief that unconstitutional actions that stem from the United States, this agent fired that gun from here, should provide a remedy. Yes, as you said in Abbasi, Bivens was a product of an era in which you freely and judiciously -- No, it's not a product of an era. But that's to be -- I -- I mean -- Justice Sotomayor, that's what the Court said in Abbasi.
You said -- No, no, no.
It -- it -- Abbasi -- that's what Abbasi said, but if you look at Bivens itself, it was based on a historical finding that rogue actions, even in foreign soils, taking a ship improperly, doing other things across the border, required a remedy. I -- Justice Sotomayor, if I may, they're very different.
And I want to be really clear on this with the Court. Yes, it is certainly true that courts for a long time applied the same common law rules for trespass and the rest to federal officers that they applied to everybody else. And that was perfectly fine under federal common law up until Erie.
And it was perfectly fine under state, statutory, and common law right up to the Westfall Act. But that's not what the Court was doing in Bivens and that's not the way it's conceived of Bivens in its later cases. It was implying a special rule, not for everybody, but for federal officers directly under the Constitution in the absence of any statutory authorization from Congress.
That's a very different animal from what state and federal courts were doing for a -- I would like -- -- really long time. -- at some point to hear your three reasons.
You had three reasons. And I hope you -- leave you enough time to go to the same question I've asked 15 times: Look, isn't this all a problem for the Fourth Amendment? But if you assume the Fourth Amendment applies, what's the added problem? So -- After all, the Fourth Amendment suppresses evidence. So -- We're not going to change that, are we? And if the Fourth Amendment applies, suppressing evidence will still happen when there's a violation and, after all, that's arguable in Congress.
It creates a mess in the court, dah-dah-dah.
Okay. So what's special about this? So I'll try to get through a couple of things really quickly.
One, the friction with Mexico, which I think is pretty obvious and exemplified by this very case. Two, extraterritoriality.
I don't have much to add to what Justice Kavanaugh said in Meshal in the D.C. Circuit.
If there were a statute and it were the same as 1983 for federal officers, I don't take anybody to be disputing that, absent some clear indication in the language, that it wouldn't pick up an entry across the border.
And it seems in passing strange that if this express statute didn't get -- get it, an implied cause of action wouldn't. And even if you disagreed with me on that, then I think you'd say, look, Congress has made judgments in this area.
It cut off all liability in the FTCA for things that happened across the border, injuries abroad.
And you couldn't get it if you were a state officer under 1983. So at least as far as we can tell in the judgments Congress has made, it has recognized that the border is really significant. And why? Mr. Wall -- Because, when you're injured abroad, you don't work it out through damages lawsuits.
You work it out through diplomatic and administrative processes.
And that's always been how Congress has done it. I mean, I think I need to -- somebody to explain to me a little bit the kind of foreign affairs concerns that you're worried about.
And, you know, it's easy to just sort of wave your hands and say foreign affairs when there's been a cross-border shooting. But I think it would help me at least to have some specifics about what kind of situations you're worried about. I mean, here, obviously, Mexico would prefer that a Bivens action be -- be given.
And that's not dispositive by any means. But I guess I'm wondering, what is the problem? I guess the -- the problem is that the United States and Mexico actively discuss incidents at the border, both specific incidents and general policies, right, as they have for years. And, for instance, CBP revised its use of force -- And as they did in this case even while the Bivens suit was going forward.
The Bivens claims does not seem to have prevented Mexico and the United States from having discussions and negotiations about this very incident.
Did it? That's right.
But the question under Abbasi isn't, look, can you show that in every case this is always the kind of thing -- I'm looking for any case. Right.
And what I'm saying is I -- take this case.
We disagree with Mexico.
We had a pair of cases.
In one of them, we thought the agent acted unlawfully. In the other, we did a very thorough investigation, it's not in the record, but I've reviewed all the evidence and would be happy to talk about it, we concluded he hadn't acted unlawfully. Mexico believes that we're wrong about that.
It believes we ought to extradite him, they ought to get their crack. It may believe as a result of this incident that we're not taking seriously our policy at the border.
That's exactly the sort of thing that we have an ambassador and a foreign minister.
We have a State Department and they have one and they talk about these issues.
And there's a -- I guess I'm -- I'm still looking for, you have -- in one state of the world, you don't have a Bivens claim, in Mr. Hernandez's position.
In another state of the world, he does have a Bivens claim. How does that interfere with the United States' foreign policy? Justice Kagan, do you really think that the next time we go in to talk to Mexico and we take a position on something at the border they won't say, how is your representation credible? You told us last time that your officer didn't do anything wrong.
And your own courts, potentially even your Supreme Court, told you you were wrong.
I think it does directly undermine the credibility of the executive branch in working with a foreign government. But, even if you thought I were wrong, you still know -- Yeah, why wouldn't -- -- under Chappell -- -- why wouldn't the United States then say, you know, we live in a country in which courts play an important role in determining whether conduct is lawful.
And that's not an embarrassment to the United States or to the executive branch. Of course, courts play a role, but the role under Abbasi is a limited one where, if there are special factors that counsel hesitation, the court says we leave it to Congress, even if you disagree with me on foreign relations, you still have clear signals from Congress in terms of the statutes it's passed and you have clear extraterritoriality. And we know from Chappell that you weigh the special factors in aggregate.
So the question just is, across all of these things, is there enough here to think that we ought to pause before we judicially imply a cause of action, and we ought to leave it to Congress. And I just think looking at the balance, there's clearly enough to say there is a body that can address these kinds of on-the-grounds concerns at the border.
But it's Congress.
It's not the courts. And I guess the -- the last thing I'd say is, you know, the Fifth Circuit looking at this said, look, the facts are tragic.
This Court said last time it's a heartbreaking loss of life but said this is not a close case under Abbasi. I -- I disagree with Respondent's counsel about some of the hypotheticals, three inches inside of the line or 10 miles inside the line, but you don't have to agree with us on those or disagree whether there is a Bivens to think that once you've crossed the border and you're dealing with foreign nationals on foreign soil, now you've crossed into territory where Congress has never gone. Did you say you disagree, Mr. Wall? I do. So the three inches inside the line, what would be the -- the case there? I think if you're talk -- I mean, so take the easiest hypothetical.
You have just foreign nationals going across the border, right.
Certainly grant that a couple of the special factors aren't going to apply, extraterritoriality and congressional action. I think you've still likely got foreign relations and national security concerns.
I think probably best answer is there's not a Bivens action. And how about 10 miles from the border but doing border security work? I think maybe you've still got foreign relations and border security.
But, again, whether or not you agree with us on that, this is the easy case where all of those special factors are triggered. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Vladeck, three minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me just say briefly that I take Mr. Wall's answer to Justice Kagan's last question to mean that the government has now changed its position from Hernandez I, where the government argued that the inside the border hypothetical would be actionable under Bivens. That aside, I mean, I do want to go back to putting this case in the broader context because I think it's important to understand how we got here.
Historically, the whole way that the tort liability regime worked for government misconduct was that this Court and state courts looked to existing common law causes of action and focused on immunity defenses as the way of calibrating the harm that citizens and others faced when injured by government officers against the need to protect officers acting in good faith, back to Judge Hand in Gregoire versus Biddle. The Court struck this balance by fashioning immunity defenses where the fight would be over whether the officer was entitled to immunity or not.
And for law enforcement officers specifically, this Court has long rejected the argument that there should be any context in which law enforcement officers, because of the frequency with which they interact with average individuals, because of the nature of their interactions, because of the powers they have to search, to seize, to arrest in this context, to use lethal force, did not justify absolute immunity and instead justified a more narrower, qualified kind of immunity for those most likely to come face-to-face with private citizens. Distilled to its simplest, the government's position in this case is that officers in what is self-described as the nation's largest law enforcement agency should have a functional absolute immunity at least where foreign nationals are concerned. And our submission is that that is not consistent with how this Court has always understood the relationship between causes of action and immunity defenses in this context. It is not required by any of this Court's Bivens decisions.
It does not abide by this Court's suggestion in Abbasi that there are strong reasons and powerful reasons to retain Bivens in this context. And it would eliminate the one deterrence that is meaningfully available to ensure that officers in the nation's largest law enforcement agency are complying with the law. Our rule is -- Before you finish -- -- not case-specific. -- before you finish, can you address one decision that the government seems to put a lot of stock -- stock in, and that is RJR -- RS -- what is it -- R -- is it RJR Nabisco? So, Justice Ginsburg, that goes again to the question of whether extraterritoriality is a special factor counseling hesitation.
And I want to be clear, we agree that there will be much harder cases, if, say, for example, Agent Mesa was miles into Mexico, somehow acting under legal authority. But RJR Nabisco reinforces, it does not distinguish Kiobel in its suggestion that the presumption against extraterritoriality -- Mr. Chief Justice -- can be displaced when the underlying conduct touches and concerns U.S. territory with sufficient force to displace the presumption. If ever there was a case, Your Honors, where the underlying conduct touched and concerned U.S. territory with sufficient force, it's when a U.S. law enforcement officer standing on U.S. soil uses lethal force. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-7739, Holguin-Hernandez versus United States. Ms. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 51 tells parties to criminal proceedings how to preserve claims of error for appeal.
A party does so by telling the court what action the party wants the court to take when a ruling is made or sought.
There's no need to tell the court twice. In every federal court of appeals except the Fifth Circuit, this rule means what it says in the context of sentencing proceedings.
Specifically, it means that a criminal defendant who argues for a particular sentence in district court preserves for appeal a challenge to a longer sentence. In the Fifth Circuit, however, a criminal defendant, like Petitioner here, must argue for a particular sentence in district court during the sentencing hearing and must object to any longer sentence as substantively unreasonable after the sentence issues.
That post-sentencing objection requirement flouts Rule 51, which expressly says that exceptions are not required. Nor is there any practical merit to the Fifth Circuit's rule.
In fact, there's no evidence that a district court has ever reconsidered a sentence in light of a post-sentencing objection.
And that makes sense.
The sentencing court will have just heard and rejected the same arguments in issuing a sentence. Recognizing that the Fifth Circuit's rule is indefensible, the government does not defend it.
Instead, it supports amicus -- or Petitioner here.
An amicus tries to defend the judgment below on alternative grounds. According to amicus, a party must identify the length beyond which a sentence is substantively unreasonable. But substantive reasonableness is not a free-standing requirement under the Sentencing Reform Act.
It is simply a standard of appellate review.
And there is no need for parties to frame their claims in terms of that standard of appellate review while they are still in district court, just as they need not frame their objections to evidentiary rulings in terms of abuse of discretion or to factual findings in terms of clear error while they are still in the trial court. Because Petitioner here adequately preserved his challenge to the length of his sentence, this Court should reverse. I'm open to questions.
But, if you have none, there are really two problems. Well, I'll ask -- The defense said -- -- I'll ask -- Counsel -- counsel argued for the preferred -- the defendant's preferred sentence.
Didn't say that anything other than that would be excessive. That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
And that is fine to put the court on notice of his claim that his sentence is too long. And there are sort of two parts to my answer.
The first is that the better reading of Section 3553(a) is that the district court's task is to identify the particular sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary to serve the statute's objectives.
And ""sufficient but not greater than necessary"" necessarily means that there is a sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary.
If one -- if 10 months is sufficient, 15 months is obviously greater.
So, by asking the court for a particular sentence, the party puts the district court on notice of their objections to any other sentence. But even if you don't agree with that reading of Section 3553(a), there is no need to inform the court of all possible actions it might take.
There's no -- there's no basis for that requirement in Rule 51 and in other areas of the law where there are -- or a district court can take a range of actions.
For example, in the context of Rule 11 sanctions or a length of continuance or reasonable attorneys' fees, a party simply has to ask for the result it wants. It doesn't have to identify all possible actions the district court might take to preserve that claim for appeal. But, I mean, let's say the -- the defendant says I think my sentence should be, you know, two years, and the district court says in its decision: Well, I think I'm going to sentence you to two years and six months because I think you've, you know, misunderstood this particular provision about, you know, history or deterrence or -- or whichever. And is the district court supposed to appreciate, and the court of appeals, if the defendant does nothing else, that he thinks it's substantively unreasonable for the district court to have added those six months, for a reason that the -- may not even have been addressed by the defendant in his submission? So two points, Your Honor.
The first is that, you know, the district court doesn't really have to appreciate that it is substantively unreasonable because, again, that's just the appellate standard of review.
The district court just has to understand that the party objects to the particular sentence.
But also -- Well, but -- but I don't know how the district court knows that if you don't require an objection after the district court has explained why he's adding the six months.
As far as he knows, well, maybe that's okay with the defendant; he wanted two years, but he can't really say that it's unreasonable to get two years and six months. Particularly since I pointed out to him precisely why I'm adding those six months. So, again, we think the better view of Section 3553(a) is that it really instructs the district court to identify a particular sentence, and so, by identifying a particular sentence, the defendant necessarily communicates that other sentences -- that he doesn't agree with other sentences. And while it's true that a defendant might not have identified every factor in Section 3553(a) in requesting a particular sentence -- you know, there are only five, I think -- and district courts and defense attorneys are familiar with those factors and there's no need to specifically run through them. Similarly, in other contexts, other areas of the law, there's no need to -- for -- to -- example, when someone -- when a district court makes a evidentiary ruling that a party disagrees with, the party doesn't have to say this is an abuse of discretion, even if the district court identifies reasons -- Yeah, but, I mean, it could end up to particularly odd results.
I mean, without a particular objection, the district judge might, you know, be sitting there in the court of appeals and the brief that is filed is, you know, 40 pages objecting to, you know, a particular provision. And the district court says: Well, that's not what I was looking at at all.
I was looking at something else. In this -- in this hypothetical, the party is raising different arguments on appeal, is that -- Well, the whole point, I -- I guess, of a post-decision objection -- Yes. -- is that it puts people on notice as to what the defendant is objecting to.
And that can shape, you know, whether it's subsequent proceedings in the district court or appellate review, when, instead, if you just say, well, so long as it's more than the defendant asked for, in a regime where there are a lot of factors -- I'd count more than five despite the subsections -- it's particularly helpful to the process that people know what the concern really is going forward. But, again, that is just the appellate standard of review.
And Rule 51 is explicit in saying that post-ruling objections are not required if you have already informed the court of the action that you wish it to take.
And there's no reason to -- to alter that approach in the sentencing context. Do you think that under the so-called parsimony principle, there is one precise sentence in every case that serves all the interests of sentencing but doesn't do so to an excessive extent? That is the district court's task, is to find the sentence the district court determines is sufficient but not -- And there's just one. So it's -- let's say it's 11 months, that is the -- that is the sentence called for by the Sentencing Reform Act, not 10, not 12.
Eleven. So it's not that there is some Platonically correct sentence.
But the district court's task is to determine the sentence that, in its view, is sufficient but not greater than necessary.
And that's, you know, inherent in sort of this parsimony principle.
I mean, that's what that language means.
If 10 months is sufficient but not greater than necessary, 10 months and one day is greater than necessary. Well, if that -- if it is not the case that there -- the parsimony principle identifies one particular, precise sentence that is the correct sentence, then saying -- then for defense counsel to say 11 -- I -- I -- I urge you to sentence my client to no more than 11 months, that's different from saying that a -- a sentence of 12 months would be outside the range of reasonableness -- Again, Your Honor, it -- -- which is what would have to be shown on appeal. -- it -- you know, it is sort of a different argument on appeal, but it is no different than, again, if you were on appeal and you had to argue that the district court's ruling was an abuse of discretion, you -- you don't have to make that abuse of discretion argument in district court, even though that is how you would have to frame your argument on appeal.
It's exactly the same here. And we're just asking for those same rules to apply in this context. What if -- Ms. Kendall -- I'm sorry. What if defense -- just along the same lines very quickly. What if defense counsel says, look, I understand that the -- the guidelines range is 10 to 12 months and I -- and I know that that's presumptively reasonable and I'm not going to argue with that, but I urge you to sentence my client to no more than 10.
And the judge says, well, I'm sorry, I'm going to choose 11. Can the defense counsel then argue on appeal 11 was unreasonable? If the defense counsel has said -- has said that 10 to 12 would be acceptable or if he's only asked for 10? He says, I understand that's the range and that's a reasonable range, but I think the appropriate sentence here is 10. So, if -- if the defense counsel simply identified the guidelines range and then asked for a particular sentence, then, yes, I think that defense counsel could argue on appeal that 11 months was substantively unreasonable. However, if a district court -- or if a defense counsel said something like, anything in the 10 to 12 months range is fine with us and we think that's -- you can do that, in that case, arguably, he has not preserved an objection to an 11-month sentence, but it -- you know, it would depend on the context of what exactly defense counsel had said. And there's no reason to craft unique rules in this context. Ms. Kendall, the amici seems in my mind to be arguing not differently than you are, that you don't need to make necessarily an objection after the fact in all circumstances. He seems to be arguing that the circumstances, though, in which you don't have to renew afterward are those where you lay forth the reasons for why you want something, and so that you merely saying, I think 10 months is enough is not enough, that that doesn't put the district court on notice of the reasons you think 10 months are enough. And so that he's basically, I think, he'll speak for himself, obviously, but assuming his argument in my question, that you need to put the district court on some sort of notice what the basis is for you believing that 10 or 12 or 11 months is the right number, and that if you don't do that, then you do need to -- you haven't preserved your objection adequately. How do you address that argument? So, as a -- just as a first point and a practical matter, it is vanishingly rare that a defense attorney will have not filed objections to the PSR and will simply stand up and say, Section 3553(a) requires a shorter sentence and sit down. I -- I agree with you.
It -- it never happened in my experience, but it doesn't mean it can't.
And so the question is for a reviewing court, when it gets that situation, what is it looking at -- So -- -- to make a judgment as to whether or not the objection was adequately preserved when it wasn't restated at the end? I'm sorry. Thank you. The Court's simply applying the same fair notice standard that it applies in every other context to determine whether a factual -- an argument is preserved.
It's the test that this Court laid out in Beech Aircraft. And anything more specific, requiring very specific facts and circumstances, as amicus tends to suggest, is unwise because it would create new problems for this Court to resolve, such as if someone argued in district court that his client was sick and deserved a shorter sentence and then argued on appeal that he was going to die and deserved a shorter sentence, the Court would have to determine whether that was the same fact and circumstance. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ratner. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to be very clear about what is and is not preserved when a defendant argues for a lower sentence than he receives.
There are three key points. First, a defendant who argues for a lower sentence does preserve the claim that the district court unreasonably declined to grant the leniency requested. Second, a defendant does not preserve any procedural challenges or any challenges, however labeled, that go to something other than the length of the sentence. And, third, a defendant who argues for leniency on one ground in the district court does not preserve a claim for leniency on a different ground. Those three points all come from the same overarching principle that parties need to give the district court an opportunity to consider and resolve their claims.
But, under Rule 51, they need to give the district court one opportunity, not two.
And that's fundamentally where the court below erred. I think that Petitioner has highlighted some of the problems. On your -- on your first two points, in my experience, a substantive unreasonableness claim is almost always coupled with a procedural failure to explain claim.
And you're saying you don't need to object for the first, but you do need to object for the second, when they're almost always coupled. So let me make this very clear.
We think Rule 51 applies equally to both of those.
We think that, as a practical matter, the first half of Rule 51, the affirmative request, is often going to be the way that substantive reasonableness claims are preserved, whereas, as a practical matter, the second half of Rule 51 is often going to be the way the procedural reasonableness claims are preserved. And that's just because of the way sentencing hearings occur.
So the whole point of a sentence hearing -- sentencing hearing is for parties to advocate to the Court what they think the appropriate sentence is.
They put the district court then on notice of those arguments. By contrast, a party isn't going to have the opportunity to tell the district court in advance, we think you've given an insufficient explanation until they've actually heard the explanation.
And so it's just because of that practical reason that those are -- are going to tend to be after-the-fact objections instead of in-advance requests. And that we -- we really do think is the key point here, that we're not asking for any sort of exception for Rule 51.
It applies the same in the sentencing context as outside the sentencing context.
It applies to substantive reasonableness claims and procedural reasonableness claims. We're just asking, is this particular claim one that the district court has already had an opportunity to consider? And -- On your -- on your third point about providing the ground for the -- the -- the claim on -- on appeal, by that, do you mean just a citation to the -- a general category of -- of sentencing consideration, or do you mean a specific argument or pointing out specific facts? What do you mean? We mean that the circumstances that the defendant feels are important under Section 3553(a) in order to entitle him to the lower sentence he's asking for. And so, to -- to give a simple hypothetical, a defendant who is in the district court and says: I deserve a below-guidelines sentence because of my family background and mitigating circumstances in my family history, has not preserved a claim for appeal that he deserves a below-guidelines sentence because of his reduced role in the offense. That hasn't fairly put the district court on notice of the substance of his claim, and so that can't be thought of as having sufficiently preserved the -- But how -- I take it that you're not suggesting that one of those grounds has to be specifically linked to a statutory factor, is that correct? We aren't -- again, the overarching question is going to be an issue of fair notice.
So, as a general matter, no, it's not necessarily the case that those types of factual circumstances have to be particularly tied up to deterrence or the seriousness of the offense or what have you. I -- I could imagine a case where a defendant's argument is so intimately tied to one of those factors that it hasn't really given the district court notice, fair notice, which, again, we think is the touchstone, but, in the ordinary case, no, we don't think that that's going to have to be tied up that neatly. How do we write -- In your -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. How do we write this opinion? Do we need to get into all of this? Are you asking us to give a sort of bible, this preserves enough, that doesn't preserve enough? Is it adequate for us just to say it's too absolute a rule to require a specific objection under all circumstances so long as a defendant has given us a fair -- given the district court notice of its grounds for a particular different sentence than given, that that's enough? So, Justice Sotomayor, I think that you could write an opinion that says the Fifth Circuit's rule is wrong; it's too absolute a rule in requiring a post hoc objection.
But I do think there would be significant value in the Court offering some clarity, not just -- For you, obviously, but -- Well, I -- Justice Sotomayor, the reason that I'm saying that is that I think the courts of appeals have largely got these questions correct.
There's really just one outlier in one direction or another. And I do think there could be some potential in this Court's decision here to introduce confusion if it's not clear about just what is -- what is and is not preserved when a defendant makes these sorts of arguments. As for what an opinion would look like, we would -- we think that Just -- Judge Sutton's opinion for the en banc Sixth Circuit in United States against Vonner navigates these various issues.
It describes how Rule 51 applies in these contexts and, again, doesn't suggest that there are any exceptions to Rule 51 but explains how, as a practical matter, that analysis is going to look a little different in some contexts than others. Back to your hypothetical with Justice Alito, I'm not sure how appellate courts are supposed to do this because it's not that it's not preserved; it's that it's reviewed under plain error.
So you would have, say, family history reviewed under substantive unreasonableness and reduced role in the offense reviewed under plain error for one inquiry of overall substantive unreasonableness, when substantive unreasonableness -- let me just add this -- itself, when you actually apply it in practice, is a lot like plain error.
Obvious it's so deferential in most courts of appeals, the kind of obvious errors when you say substantive -- substantively unreasonable. So I'm not sure how a judge can keep all that straight. Well, I think, in practice, it hasn't been that complicated, Justice Kavanaugh, and courts -- again, this is the rule that we think is in play in -- Well, I think that supports -- -- most of the courts of appeals.
And -- Keep going. The way that that shakes out is usually one of two ways.
So, first, a court of appeals might say, looking at all of those circumstances that you preserved, we don't see this as a substantively unreasonable sentence or we don't see this as an abuse of discretion.
And then, if we look to the circumstances you are raising for the first time, nothing in there suggests that our analysis of substantive reasonableness is plain error.
That's sort of option 1 they do. Option 2, and -- and sort of going to your second point that this is already a deferential standard, we see fairly often courts say, well, even assuming that all of this had been preserved, it wouldn't be a substantively unreasonable sentence, or it wouldn't be an abuse of discretion. Would -- can you imagine a sentence that's substantively unreasonable but not plain error? Yes, we do think that there is a small sliver of daylight between these standards.
I -- It's extremely small? It is very small.
We think that's exactly why, if this case is vacated and remanded, we would advocate for the same outcome under a substantive reasonable review. You might think of it as analogous to double deference under AEDPA, that -- there's already a deferential standard of review, but if you were to add plain error on top, you'd get sort of an extra little bit of deference. Again, it probably wouldn't be dispositive in most cases, and that's why it doesn't create that many difficulties for courts in practice. But, at the end of the day, the key problem with the Fifth Circuit's rule here is that it's requiring parties to say, in the district court, the applicable appellate standard of review.
And that's just not something that litigants are required to do in any other context. The district court's job, under Rita and Kimbrough and Gall, is to decide the sentence that is appropriate under the Section 3553(a) factors.
And reasonableness is just not an inquiry that comes into play until the case is appealed, and that's the inquiry that the court of appeals will apply in the first instance. If there are no further questions, we would ask the Court to vacate and remand. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is what a party must do in the district court to preserve a substantive reasonableness argument for appeal.
In particular, under Rule 51, what must a party argue and when must they argue it? Let me start with the what. To preserve a substantive reasonableness argument, a party must argue two things.
One, they must make the distinct legal argument that an imposed sentence is beyond the range of choice a district court has under 3553(a) and, two, identify the facts and circumstances supporting that argument. Those are the legal and factual grounds underpinning a substantive reasonableness argument.
And under the best interpretation of Rule 51, a statement of grounds is necessary to preserve a claim of error. Now let me turn to the when.
In most cases, these arguments are most sensibly made after sentencing because it's only then that the parties know the imposed sentence and the district court's reasoning for it.
And in most cases, I think you need to know those things to really determine whether you have a viable substantive reasonableness argument to assert. But, technically, nothing in Rule 51 stops a party from making those arguments prior to imposition of a sentence, and so preservation pre-sentencing is possible in certain cases. The government appears to agree with at least part of this rule; in particular, the government agrees that a party must present the district court with the facts and circumstances supporting a substantive reasonableness argument in order to rely -- rely on those same facts and circumstances on appeal. And, frankly, that does not seem to be a controversial or novel proposition.
A party that never argued below that a sentence was substantively impermissible, because, for example, it created unwarranted sentencing disparities, should not be able to advance that same argument for the first time on appeal. The somewhat harder question, and the question on which I part ways with the -- with the government, concerns the first part of the rule.
To preserve a substantive reasonableness argument, is it simply enough to ask for a shorter sentence in the district court, or must a party do more than that? And for several reasons, I think the Fifth Circuit is required -- correct to require parties to do more.
Most fundamentally, merely arguing for a shorter sentence does not address the same issue that is before the court of appeals on a substantive reasonableness challenge. The court of appeals will not evaluate the reasonableness of the defendant's requested sentence.
Rather, the court will evaluate the reasonableness of the imposed sentence.
A party seeking to preserve a substantive reasonableness argument must present that same issue to the district court, but -- I think one of the strongest things Ms. Turner said, in addition to her legal arguments, was that, in practice, this never produces a different result because the judge, presumably, has already -- and in reality, has already thought about what is the reasonable sentence.
So for them to object I think that's unreasonable is going to go nowhere.
So why, in addition to the legal points, as a practical matter require that? A couple responses to that, Justice Kavanaugh.
First of all, I fully concede that in most cases it probably won't make much of a difference, but I think that's more because of the very limited nature of substantive reasonableness challenges than it is because of the preservation rules. Substantive reasonableness challenges are very difficult to win because, most of the time, district courts are sentencing well within the discretion that they have.
So I fully concede that most of the time it won't make a difference. However, I don't think that means that it won't always have some benefit.
And I think it will have benefit in those cases where a substantive reasonableness argument is likely to have the most viability.
And that's a case in which, for whatever reason, the imposed sentence differs dramatically from the sentence that -- from the guidelines range and from the sentence the parties have requested.
For example, if a defendant requests a 40-month sentence and the government -- the court imposes a 200-month sentence.
And these cases do happen from time to time in the courts of appeals. In that circumstance, I think it's likely that the -- that the district court has used reasoning and rationales that the parties might not theretofore have addressed or had an opportunity to argue about.
And so, in that situation, there is some benefit, I think, to having a party to -- to -- to apprise the court to say: Your Honor, I think the sentence you imposed is not only one I disagree with but is so excessive, it's outside the range of permissible sentences you could impose, and let me explain to you why that is.
Let me engage with you on some of the reasoning you gave, why the party thinks the court -- the court might have put too much weight on an impermissible factor, not enough weight on a very important factor. So the short answer is, in most cases, it probably won't make much of a difference, but in the cases where a substantive reasonableness argument is likely to matter the most, it very well could have -- could make a difference. In the case -- in the hypo you raised, the counsel almost always raise a procedural failure to explain. Objection -- in your hypo -- Judge, you haven't explained that sufficiently.
Right? Correct.
You know, so -- and I think that gets to two points.
One is I think what's procedural and what's substance in this circumstance can get very difficult sometimes, and it's an issue that the courts of appeals have struggled with.
For example, if you disagree with the district court's reasoning, is it a procedural problem because the court failed to adequately explain it, or is it a substantive problem because the court explained it, you just disagree with the reasoning the court gave? I think it could be argued either way.
And I think the courts of appeals have sometimes struggled with what it is. Well, they mostly get funneled into procedural. A lot of times they do. And, you know, as -- as this Court said very clearly in Gall, you know, failure to adequately explain a chosen sentence is a procedural problem that I think everybody standing up here arguing today agrees that if you think a district court has not adequately explained its chosen sentence, a party should object to that in the district court and give the district court judge an opportunity to correct it. Well, if that's not true -- if that's true, I guess it's hard for me to see why a party shouldn't also object if they disagree with some of the reasoning the district court gave and that reasoning hadn't been discussed previously in sentencing. In that circumstance, it would seem to serve the purposes of Rule 51 to have a rule that asks the parties to apprise the court of -- of the -- that the court has used reasoning or rationales that the parties disagree with, that it believes are incorrect, that it believes are impermissible and have the court -- have the parties engage with the court on that to give the district court an opportunity to address that in the first instance, such that the court of appeals aren't having to address it for the first time on appeal. I do think, in thinking about this, the jury instruction analogy is somewhat helpful, and I would concede that the jury instructions are governed by a specific rule, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 30.
But, in the jury instruction context, we do require parties to object to a provided instruction if they believe it's impermissible, and we require that even if they had previously proposed an instruction to the district court that has been rejected. I think the same principle applies here.
Just because a party has requested a particular sentence does not mean they've necessarily and inevitably argued that the actually imposed sentence is so excessive and so extreme that it's outside the range of -- of -- of permissible sentences the court could have imposed.
The district court -- Is that -- is that the standard, so excessive and so extreme? I mean, the argument really is simply that it doesn't comply with the factors in 3553, right? That is the -- you know, that's the -- the argument on appeal -- the excessive or extreme is my shorthand.
That's not the standard that a substantive reasonableness is, but I think when you view substantive reasonableness through the deferential analysis that this Court has said courts of appeals are to apply to district courts, generally, what courts of appeals are doing is saying, we think the sentence you've imposed is outside the discretion you had to impose the sentence based off the 33(a) factors and the reasons you gave, the reasons just -- even though district courts have substantial discretion, the reasons the court gave do not support the sentence it imposed. And so, yes, it's a -- it's -- the way this Court put it in Gall, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, was, if there's an unusually harsh or unusually lenient sentence that's not justified by the reasons the district court gave. But, Mr. Allen, in saying what you just did, are you suggesting that substantive reasonableness is the standard that a district court should use in -- in assessing what the proper punishment is? I don't think so, Justice Kagan.
What I -- I think my argument is not so much that a district court should be asking whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable or a party should be saying it's substantively unreasonable in the district court.
I think I'm asking that the -- the party assert the grounds for that argument, the basis for that argument in the district court. And so, when you think about the purposes of Rule 51, we want parties to argue the same thing in the district court that they're then going to argue -- go on to argue on appeal. And the basis for a substantive reasonableness argument, I think, are two things.
One is the sentence is -- is outside the range of permissible sentences that could have been imposed under 3553(a) in light of the specific facts of the case and, two, the reasons for why that's true. And I think the rule that we've put to the Court and the rule that I think the Fifth Circuit applies is just asking parties to make those same arguments in the district court. That's going to be what they present to the Fifth Circuit or a court of appeals when they appeal it.
We want parties to make those same -- the exact same arguments in the district court. That doesn't seem to be what the question presented is.
I mean, yes, there might be questions in a particular case, you know, if you say the sentence should be X because I cooperated with the government and then the appeals court, you say, the sentence should be X because I'm a very sick man, you know, then you have an issue about what grounds you presented. But that's not the issue that's presented by the Fifth Circuit's practice, is it? The issue that's presented by the Fifth Circuit's practice is this requirement that -- that in -- that after the sentence is given in the district court, the defendant have to step up and say, you know, I object to that, Your Honor. So I don't think that's actually what the Fifth Circuit's doing in practice.
And I think this is an important point that might help the Court. I think the Fifth Circuit's rule is much more about what a party must say than when a party must say it.
We found no Fifth Circuit case in which the Fifth Circuit has said the timing of an objection is dispositive, that where the Fifth Circuit said, you clearly objected to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence before imposition of a sentence, but you didn't repeat it after -- If the Fifth Circuit had the rule that I'm suggesting the Fifth Circuit has and that you're saying it doesn't have, the -- if the Fifth Circuit had that rule, would it be a violation of the rules? I -- I -- I don't think that would be the best reading of Rule 51 and that's not the -- the approach we've put to the Court.
Again, I don't think the timing of the objection should matter. I hate to press that a little bit -- No, go ahead. -- but not the best reading of Rule 51? It -- it -- it -- Is that -- -- it would be an incorrect reading of Rule 51 -- Okay. -- to answer the question directly.
I don't think Rule 51 requires these objections to be made at any specific point in time during the sentencing proceeding.
All they require is that a party state the grounds at some point.
And the grounds are what I started off articulating my argument with. Now I think most sensibly, I think these are arguments that should really be made after sentencing because it's only then that you know what your sentence is and what the district court's reasons for it.
And I think only then would you be in a position to determine whether you have a viable substantive reasonableness argument to make.
But -- Well, and maybe not even then.
I mean, the question of what arguments you're going to raise on appeal is not something that's immediately obvious when -- when the sentence comes down.
It's something that usually requires some consideration, some tactical analysis, all sorts of things. So I wonder what specificity you're requiring in this, I won't call it an exception since that's a problem for you, but this objection, this post hoc objection? So two responses to that, Mr. Chief Justice.
One is the concern about having to think about arguments on your feet isn't unique to the sentencing context, obviously.
There's all kinds of circumstances in criminal trials and -- and other proceedings where we do expect lawyers to be on their toes in court and to raise arguments that -- that come up to them on the spot. Well, yeah, but I'm not trying -- I don't mean think of every argument you have.
I mean, do some -- figure out, well, we do have an argument on this point, but we don't think we're going to -- if we don't win on this point, we don't think we'll win on that, so we're only going to make this. I mean, it's a little more nuanced than objections during the course of the trial. Perhaps.
But I also think that parties do do a tremendous amount of work going in to preparing for a sentencing proceeding.
You know, they review the PSR. They know what they're going to go in and argue for on behalf of their client, and then they can hear the district court's reasoning and determine whether there's something in that reasoning that they think is factually wrong or the court is putting too much weight on an inappropriate factor or not enough weight on a factor that they think is very important. So it might be more difficult in --- in cases where sentencing proceedings go for an entire day than it will be for a case like this one, where it took five or six minutes.
But I don't think it's unreasonable to require parties to do that, and, in fact, you know, it -- it -- it's what I think the purpose of Rule 51 is intended to serve, which is to keep defense counsel on their toes and to alert the court that they think the court has made some error that has caused it to reach an incorrect result, so that the district court is considering that in the first instance and that courts of appeals aren't having to consider that. Most of the grounds will have been identified in the sentencing memos after the PSR and at the sentencing hearing, presumably.
If they've all been identified there, do they -- do you have to raise it again in your view? Do you think that's the best reading of -- I don't think you have to raise anything again.
I -- I think that would be an unreasonable reading of Rule 51.
I think you just have to preserve them at some point during the entire process.
So you don't have to repeat arguments you might have raised in a presentencing memo or raised earlier in the proceeding. I just think you have to apprise the court at some point that the sentence that's imposed is outside the range of permissible sentences it could impose and explain why and explain -- Do you think there's a lot of daylight between your position and what the government has been saying? The only daylight I see is in the first part of my rule.
Remember, my rule has two points: One is you have to make the distinct legal argument that an imposed sentence is beyond the range of permissible choice; and then two is you have to state the facts and circumstances. The government agrees with part 2.
So really all it is, I think, is my requirement to require some more specificity that, hey, I'm raising the grounds for a substantive reasonableness argument as opposed to just simply asking for a shorter sentence. So if -- And you -- Please. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead. This outside the range, where -- where do you think that that comes from? Because it seems to me that that comes from the reasonableness, the substantive reasonableness standard, which is an appellate standard. 3553, which is the statute that's directed to the trial judge, doesn't talk about ranges.
To the contrary, it talks about, you know, there's a particular point. And, of course, your particular point, your particular sentence might be different from somebody else's particular point and particular sentence, and the appellate court can say, you know, both of those are within the range of reasonableness. But the range seems a task for the appellate court and not for the district court. Well, so the way I read this Court's decisions in Rita, Booker, and Gall, that they all emphasize the extraordinary amount of discretion that courts of -- that district courts have in sentencing. And I guess, Justice Kagan, I have trouble envisioning, kind of imagining what that discretion is if it's not discretion to pick amongst a number of sentence all -- sentences, all of which are sufficient but not greater than necessary to serve the sentencing purposes. I think those decisions seem to recognize that you could have the same defendant convicted of the same crime presented to three different district court judges, all of whom -- Let me give -- -- reach different sentences. -- you an example from a different context, and it's much like the one that Ms. Turner gave.
I mean, suppose we had some decision which is subject to an abuse of discretion standard. What we wouldn't want to have happen is for the trial court to be making that decision and saying, I -- this is -- is this an abuse of discretion? No, we would want the trial court to be making the best decision that the court can make and then leave it to the appellate court to make -- to apply the abuse of discretion standard. And so too here, why isn't the directive to the trial court to say: Pick the sentence that's the appropriate -- the single appropriate sentence you think under 3553, and then it's for the appellate court to say whether that falls within the range of reasonableness? So I -- I -- I want to be very clear.
I do think it's still the district court's job to pick the sentence that's sufficient but not greater than necessary.
And I -- I don't think courts should be thinking about this in terms of what's reasonable or abuse of discretion. But I do think that -- that we still want to require parties to speak up and object if they believe that -- that the sentence the district court has imposed is not just one that they disagree with but one that has given rise to a new argument that they're going to make on appeal, which is that, Your Honor, the sentence is not just one that I think is an exercise of discretion that I disagree with; it's one that's outside the range of discretion that I think this Court has in the -- in the first instance. But there are many examples where that might occur, you know, you ask the trial court to do something, it says no. And then, in all these non-sentencing contexts, do you have to say, you know, Your Honor, not only is that not what I asked you to do, but it's also an abuse of discretion? The short answer is no, I don't think so in those other contexts.
The longer answer is I do think there are some contexts in which we do require something similar to what I'm asking for here.
Jury instructions is probably the best example, because district court judges do have discretion in how they shape jury instructions, and Rule 30 does require that if you think the district court has kind of gone outside the bounds of what it can do in the jury instruction context, you do have to apprise the court of that. I think sentencing should be a -- a context in which we require something similar to that because of the parsimony principle in 3553(a), because of the -- the significance -- the -- the -- you know, the significant guided nature of the court's discretion and the obligation -- special obligation the court has to explain its sentencing -- sentence under 3553(c). So the short answer is I would not require the same requirement in those other contexts.
The reason we would -- I think we should require it here is sentencing -- sentencing is meaningfully different. Even -- under the Fifth Circuit's rule, even if you don't object, it's going to be reviewed for plain error on appeal.
And I'll ask the same question I asked Ms. Ratner, which is, can you imagine a sentence that's substantively unreasonable but not plain error? Because, usually, when judges find -- appellate judges find it's substantively unreasonable, they're saying, wow, the district judge really jumped the rails there. Yeah. And that sounds -- and that's the common reaction that -- to a sentence that is found substantively unreasonable, and that sounds like plain error. I agree with Ms. Ratner on this.
I -- I -- I think there is some daylight between plain error and abuse of discretion, probably not much.
I do think many sentences that are deemed substantively unreasonable will like satisfy plain error review.
But I don't think the -- It's exceedingly rare for an appellate court to find a sentence substantively unreasonable. It's exceedingly rare. Yes, Justice Kavanaugh.
But I don't think that's an issue this Court should prejudge because plain error review, as this Court has said, is a very fact-intensive case-by-case determination, and so I don't think the Court should just say, well, every substantively unreasonable sentence will be plain error.
It might well turn out to be the case -- Yeah. -- but I don't think the Court should prejudge that.
And just -- By substantively unreasonable, you mean nothing more than an erroneous application of the 3553 standards, right? Well, correct, Mr. Chief Justice, although it would have to be so erroneous that it falls outside the range of substantial discretion that we understand district courts to have at sentencing.
So it's not just it's wrong. And the way it's -- It's very wrong. -- the way it's articulated in many of the appellate courts is very deferentially articulated. That's correct, Justice Kavanaugh. There's one question you asked that -- that I did want to address.
You asked the government of -- what would happen in a situation where we -- you have some preserved arguments and some unpreserved arguments and some of which are subject to plain error and some of which subject to harmless error review, for example. That does come up in other circumstances.
We were looking into this.
It -- it comes up in cumulative error circumstance where parties are arguing cumulative error, there were a number of errors below, some of which were preserved, some of which were not. It can come up in the ineffective assistance of counsel area, where you argue that counsel was ineffective for some reasons but not others. The short answer is it's -- it can be difficult, but courts of appeals have found ways to deal with it.
And the way they do it is typically what Ms. Ratner said, they start by looking at the preserved errors, sort through those to see whether there's any grounds to reverse on that, and then go to the -- to the unpreserved errors. But I guess the point I would make is courts of appeals have found a way to deal with it.
They haven't just said, oh, just because -- you know, because we have this problem, we're just going to assume everything is preserved and -- and go on to -- to consider it. A couple more points, Mr. Chief Justice.
One thing this Court had said in Gall I think is helpful in thinking about this.
This Court said in Gall that if a district court judge determines that an outside guideline sentence is warranted, he must ""consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance."" Well, I think, in most cases, you won't know whether the district court's justification is sufficiently compelling until you hear the court's sentence and the reasons for it.
It's only then whether you can assess whether the justifications are sufficient to support the unusually harsh or unusually lenient sentence. And if it's not, I -- I think it's reasonable, I think, to require a party to object and explain to the court why that's true. And I think that's something that Rule 51 reasonably requires in -- in asking parties to preserve their grounds for the argument. If there are no further questions, let me leave the Court with one final thought in thinking about this case.
I think it's beneficial to consider not the run-of-the-mill sentencing case but the sentencing proceeding in which a -- a substantive reasonableness argument is likely to have the most viability. And that's when an imposed sentence differs dramatically from the guidelines range and likely the sentence that the parties have been advocating before it.
In that circumstance, I think it's important to craft a rule that asks the parties to engage with the district court about the sentence it imposed and the reasons that it gave for doing so. Otherwise, courts of appeals will have to address that -- that -- address those issues in the first instance. The better rule, I think, is if a party believes that an imposed sentence is so excessive that it's beyond the range of choice that 3553(a) allows, they should make that specific argument to the district court and identify the facts and circumstances supporting it. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Ms. Ratner.
I'm sorry, Ms. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The amicus's test is trying to fix a problem that does not exist.
Nine courts of appeals show that the Fifth Circuit's rule is not necessary to the effective functioning of courts.
Not only is it not necessary to the effective functioning of courts, it is inconsistent with Rule 51 in two ways. First is insofar as it requires a post-sentencing objection that is inconsistent with both part (a) and part (b) of the rule, which express -- part (b) expressly makes clear that exceptions are not required. Second, to frame the argument in terms of substantive reasonableness or the other articulations that my friend used, outside the range of reasonableness, abuse of discretion, that's just the appellate standard of review. And there is no need to frame objections in district court in terms -- in those terms. And, second, Rule 51 just says that parties are required to tell the court what action the party wants the court to take. This facts-and-circumstances argument is, as Justice Kagan remarked, outside the question presented.
But just to briefly say a few things, all we are asking this Court to do is to leave it to -- to lower courts to apply the same fair notice standard that they apply in other contexts in this context, and the grounds language that my friend is relying on is not found anywhere in Rule 51.
It is only -- Where do you disagree with the government? Where do you disagree with the government? The -- well, I think the government's position and our position is -- are very close.
I think -- Where is the window where it's not? Where we might disagree is about when arguments are preserved, when a district court has fair notice.
I think we both agree that the fair notice standard applies, but we might find more arguments -- that the district court had more -- had fair notice of more arguments than the -- than the government is willing to concede. So, for example, here, I think they -- they are not -- don't expressly address the public dangerousness argument that we raised below.
But that's an area where we disagree. But, as I was saying, in Rule 46, there is this grounds language.
It is not present in Rule 51, and Rule 51 postdates Rule 46.
So the rule enactors clearly knew how to require that if they wanted to.
But even if you think there is some sort of grounds requirement in Rule 51 that's sort of implied, all that means is that the party needs to preserve the legal grounds on which they are relying.
It does not mean they have to preserve every fact and circumstance. Finally, as I mentioned earlier in response to Justice Sotomayor's questions, this facts-and-circumstances test would mire the courts in very fact-bound disputes. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Allen, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below.
You have ably discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1116, Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee versus Sulyma. Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1113(2) of ERISA requires that claims for breach of fiduciary duty be brought within three years of when the plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach.
In 2015, the Respondent, Sulyma, sued, claiming that his retirement plans imprudently overinvested in hedge funds and commodities.
But more than three years before that suit was filed, Sulyma received plan disclosures that apprised him of the precise investment allocations he later claimed were imprudent. The Ninth Circuit held that those disclosures would not trigger the three-year bar because Sulyma testified that he had not read them and Intel, therefore, had not established that he had subjective awareness of what was disclosed.
The Ninth Circuit was wrong to read the statute to require proof of subjective awareness. Under Section 1113(2), plan participants have actual knowledge of facts that are actually given to them in mandatory ERISA disclosures.
That reading respects ERISA's text and the statutory emphasis on -- the structural emphasis in the statute on robust disclosure by plan fiduciaries and private policing by plan participants. The Ninth Circuit's reading upends that balance.
It effectively doubles from three to six years the period in which plaintiffs can exploit hindsight bias to second-guess investments, even when plans have fully disclosed the basis for those investments, and it introduces arbitrariness and intractable proof problems. Now one way to bring the correct interpretation of Section 1 -- 1113(2) into focus is by considering the provision as it was originally enacted in 1974, and that's reproduced at pages 38 and 39 of the Blue Brief. The original statute provided that the three-year limitations period would be triggered either when a plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or when the plan filed with the Department of Labor a report that included facts from which a participant could reasonably learn of the facts of the breach. Now, if you read the statute in the way that the Ninth Circuit read it, it doesn't make any sense as it was originally enacted because the three-year period would be triggered in a situation in which the plan disclosed to the Department of Labor the facts that establish the breach but not when the -- when the plan disclosed to the plan participants themselves in mandatory disclosures the very same facts that would trigger it if provided to the Department of Labor. That just doesn't make any sense of the statute.
Our reading, in contrast, makes perfect sense of the statute.
And if I could, I -- I will start with the text and -- and, I think, try to take a minute and explain why we've got a perfectly reasonable linguistic understanding of Section 1113(2). And it's this: A plaintiff has actual knowledge of facts actually provided to him in mandatory disclosures because, when the plaintiff receives the disclosure, he has, in the word of the statute's past tense ""had,"" but he has in his possession a body -- the body of knowledge contained in the disclosures.
He possesses that knowledge.
And that's the knowledge he actually has. Most people don't read them. You know, I -- I -- I -- Or many.
Many people don't read them.
So how do you have actual knowledge if you haven't read it? So I -- you know, Your Honor, I don't know that that's correct.
I think, actually, with respect to these -- Well, suppose -- -- kinds of documents -- -- for the group of people who don't read them, how can you say that they have actual knowledge if they haven't read something? So I -- I think the reason is because the -- the phrase ""actual knowledge"" in this context in particular, but, frankly, in any context, isn't limited to subjective awareness in the way that the Ninth Circuit limited it, and I think that the willful blindness doctrine demonstrates that.
We -- But, Mr. Verrilli, we do have the six-year outer limit, and then there's a special shorter limit if you have actual knowledge.
And it's hard to read the word ""actual"" to mean something other than yes, I, in fact, know. And as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, there are many people who don't read these mailings.
I must say I don't read all the mailings that I get about my investments. (Laughter.) So I think, with respect to what ""actual knowledge"" means in this statute, it's important to think about it in context, and it's really -- the idea of taking the phrase ""actual knowledge"" and treating it in this context as though it means the same thing in the other contexts in which it's used is a mistake. This is really a unicorn when it comes to statutes of limitations.
This is the only place in the United States Code that we could find the phrase ""actual knowledge"" used in the statute of limitations.
And our friends on the other side haven't identified any state statute of limitations that uses the phrase ""actual knowledge"" either. Mr. Verrilli, I -- I think you were about to push back on -- on Justice Kavanaugh's assertion that people don't read these.
Do you have any -- any -- is there any reason for us to assume the opposite of what I gather is a common personal experience? So I -- look -- (Laughter.) I won't -- I won't ask for a show of hands, but -- (Laughter.) -- do you have any reason to suppose that many people or -- Yes.
Yes, I do.
I mean, this is -- What -- what is that? It's -- well, I -- I do think that this is important information.
For many people, this information, how their retirement plans are going to be -- how their retirement funds are going to be invested, is very important.
Many people's -- Well, I'm sure -- I'm sure -- I mean -- -- economic security depends on this. -- the -- the fact is important, but whether people think the information is important, I think -- I'm just not -- well, I'd be surprised. I mean, it's one of those things, the more and more disclosures that are required, the less and less likely it is that people are going to look at them.
And -- and it seems to me that your argument depends upon the assumption that these are actually going to be read so that we would dispense with the requirement of showing that they were actually read because we assume that they were most often actually read.
And I just don't think that's an accurate assumption. I don't think I -- I don't think our argument does depend on that assumption.
I think that the -- Congress set this system up in 1974.
It made clear that the disclosure regime was a very important part of the regulatory -- of the regulatory program. And the point, as Congress said in 1974, of these robust disclosures was to give plan participants the information they would need to police their rights.
And so, when Congress enacted -- that's what the Senate report says in 1974 repeatedly.
And, of course, in 1974, Congress also granted a private right of action to plan participants to sue for breach of fiduciary duty. So I do think the system was set up on the understanding that this was important information and it had to be conveyed to plan participants according to the statute and its implementing regulations in a manner that was readily comprehensible so that the average plan participant could understand it and could take action as necessary to police his or her rights. So I do think that the -- that the understanding that Congress is operating under here is that people do read these -- do read these disclosures when they come.
And if one looks at the -- for example, the email that Mr. Sulyma got, and you can see this at page, I think, 149 of the Joint Appendix with respect to the qualified default investment alternative disclosure, he gets an email that says -- the heading says important information about your retirement plan. And it contains a link.
And the link says -- it says you should read the document in this link.
And if you click on the link, it takes you not to some big giant document but to an eight- or ten-page document that describes the investments in the various target fund plans. And if one looks at page 236 of the Joint Appendix, one will see that for Mr. Sulyma's plan, it specifically says the target asset allocation in this fund is 10 percent bond funds and short-term investments, 60 percent equity funds, 25 percent hedge funds, and 5 percent commodities. That's the precise thing he says is a breach of fiduciary duty and -- I mean -- and the precise thing that he says was a breach of fiduciary duty and it's disclosed to him right there in this document. But, Mr. Verrilli, what role does willful blindness play in your argument? Are you claiming that anybody who doesn't read these documents is being willfully blind? No. Or is there a different argument that you're making? No.
I'm -- we're making a different argument, and it -- and it -- and it's why I said, Mr. Chief Justice, that I thought our argument didn't depend on the empirical assumption that people -- everyone actually reads these -- these documents when they get them. Willful blindness is -- is not constructive knowledge.
Willful blindness is a form of actual knowledge.
And that's how this Court addressed it in Global-Tech.
In Global-Tech, of course, the Court struggled in the patent inducement context to decide first whether the inducement cause of action required proof of actual knowledge or proof of constructive knowledge.
It concluded it required proof of actual knowledge. And then the Court went on to say: But actual knowledge can be satisfied by proof of willful blindness.
And what that demonstrates is that there are situations in which the actual knowledge standard can be satisfied by imputing knowledge, even a -- in a situation where it can't be proved. Who would have thought -- But you say this is not -- this is not willful, though? No, we're not saying that.
We're using it by analogy to demonstrate the point that the outer bound of actual knowledge is not subjective awareness, which is the standard that the Ninth Circuit adopted; that there are circumstances in which the Court, as -- as -- by operation of law, will recognize that something other than subjective awareness can satisfy an actual knowledge standard. I guess I would have thought about it a little bit differently, not that the willful blindness is satisfying the actual knowledge inquiry but, rather, that, because you've been willfully blind, because you've deliberately ignored some piece of evidence, we will treat it as if you actually knew. But -- but, still, the willful blindness is a -- is a different thing.
It's just that given your intent, we're going to treat it as one and the same. Well, but I think the -- the way I would -- the way I would give that a little bit of a different nuance, Your Honor, is that I think with respect to willful blindness, what you're saying is, even a situation where it's not possible to prove that a defendant -- and it's usually a criminal defendant or a defendant in some kind of enforcement action -- has the subjective awareness necessary to satisfy an actual knowledge standard, you're going to impute that subjective awareness to the defendant.
It's an imputation. Correct, because of their bad intent, shall we say. Right.
And so -- Because of their saying I'm purposefully not going to know this. Right. But, here, you're saying not everybody -- But -- -- who has actual knowledge -- -- I think this gets -- -- is willfully blind in that way. That's -- that's correct, but I think that -- but we're not -- what we're saying is that by analogy, once you think here about the context, because what's happened with this actual knowledge standard, as I said, this is the only statute of limitations we can find in which it exists. It's -- the overwhelming number of situations in which it exists are the ones that we've been talking about here, situations in which you're trying to ascertain the level of culpability in a criminal action or an enforcement action. So you're transplanting it into a totally different environment here.
And then not only that, but normally, in statutes of limitations, when -- when there's a knowledge element in a statute of limitations, it's something that works to the benefit of the plaintiff. In a typical statute of limitations, you'd say the statute runs six years from a certain act or occurrence, but it will be either the later of that or three years after the plaintiff has or should have had knowledge. Here, the knowledge requirement is -- is operating for a totally different reason. It's in the statute to protect the interests of the defendant.
It takes the six-year period of repose and cuts it in half when a plaintiff has actual knowledge. And I submit that, therefore, the right way to think about this is by thinking about this in terms of the interest that this provision is in the statute to advance.
And the interest that it's in the statute to advance, it seems to me, are per -- synch up perfectly with the disclosure requirements that the -- that the statute imposes on plan fiduciaries. If the statute had said ""should have had knowledge,"" you would plainly prevail, but it doesn't say ""should have had knowledge."" It says ""actual knowledge."" And you're reading the word ""actual"" out of the statute. I disagree with that characterization.
We think the word ""actual"" does real and substantial work in our reading of the statute.
We're not arguing that you should read this language as though it were a broad constructive knowledge standard. A broad constructive knowledge standard would be a knew or should have known standard.
And if it were a broad constructive knowledge standard, then the disclosure of the information to the plan participant -- even if the information disclosed itself wouldn't establish the facts of a -- of a breach of fiduciary duty, if it put the plan participant on notice such that a -- a reasonable person would inquire further, that would be a constructive knowledge, a should have known standard. Does an entity like your client have the ability to determine whether someone to whom one of these emails with the link is sent has opened up the link? So we -- with respect to this, you know, in this case, no.
Generally, it's difficult. But you could do that, certainly Intel would have the ability to do that, wouldn't it? It could, I think, yes. I think it would be very difficult and time-consuming.
And I don't think it would change the issue because I think, even if we could establish that the -- that the plan participant clicked on the link, then -- then the argument is going to be the same argument. It's going to be, yeah, I clicked on it, but I didn't read it, or I read it, but I didn't remember it, and, therefore, I don't have the subjective awareness that the Ninth Circuit said is required. And so I -- I don't think -- I mean, I understand why you might think that that's a solution, Your Honor, but I -- but I don't think it is.
I think it just shifts the problem over a little bit, but it's the -- it's the exact same problem. And I think it points up why the right way to read this statute.
Now we are -- we are arguing for an imputation of knowledge, not an empirical assumption.
We are doing that.
But we're doing that because we think that is the most sensible way to synch up what the statute has done here, which is to impose a very robust disclosure, set of disclosure obligations, for the purpose of giving plan participants the ability to police their rights. Why isn't the -- And -- -- way -- sorry -- why isn't the way to think about this that, as you say, this is an unusual provision, and you make a lot of strong policy arguments, but, for whatever reason, in the amendment of the statute, it just came out in -- as actual knowledge, and it's an unusual statute, but we stick to the words of the statute, and Congress can, of course, fix it to bring it in line with the other constructive knowledge statutes if Congress so chooses, but we shouldn't rewrite it ourselves. What -- what's wrong with thinking about this that way? Well, Your Honor, in -- in Yates, the Court concluded that Fish was not a tangible object, even though, in ordinary English, it's obviously a tangible object.
You can hold it in your hand. In Brown & Williamson, the Court concluded that nicotine was not a drug for purposes of the -- of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, even though, in common understanding, it can -- But if we start rewriting -- -- obviously be a drug. -- if -- And so I -- what I guess I would say is that I don't think it's rewriting the statute at all.
It's taking a -- what it's doing is reading those words in context in order to make sense of the statute as a whole, which was exactly the analysis in Yates and Brown & Williamson and last term in Jackson with respect to what the word ""defendant"" means and in King against Burwell.
And it's that -- that -- all we're urging is the Court apply that same weight. Don't take the words in isolation and just look them up in the dictionary.
And particularly don't do it here because this -- this actual knowledge standard that my friends on the other side are transplanting here, what they're transplanting is a body of -- of law that applies in a totally different context that doesn't have anything to do with a regime of disclosure on a statute of limitations. It's about assessing personal culpability in the criminal and enforcement context.
And in this context, I think that you've got to read these words in conjunction with -- But, if we -- if we were to say what you want us to say here, actual knowledge is, in effect, a form of constructive knowledge, that could open up all sorts of problems in other statutes down the road that we can't even foresee here where the argument would be the constructive knowledge is enough to satisfy a knowledge requirement at this point. I don't -- I don't think so for two reasons, Your Honor.
First, we're not asking you to adopt a constructive knowledge standard.
We're asking you to interpret the words ""actual knowledge"" to include the information, the knowledge that is transmitted to, the information that is made known to the plan participants through -- That sounds like -- -- its disclosures. -- constructive knowledge to me. I don't think so, Your Honor, in the same way that you -- you might say the same thing about willful blindness being constructive knowledge.
But -- but I think it's -- it is -- it is an imputation, to be sure, but it's an imputation with -- that's legitimately within the meaning of the words ""actual knowledge."" And the other thing I would point out, Your Honor, is that, you know, until the Ninth Circuit ruled in this case, the rule that everybody's been living under, ERISA, is our rule.
This is the way the courts had uniformly interpreted it until the Ninth Circuit in this case and everybody understood that that's the way the statute operated. And -- and so the -- in the -- so, in that sense, I don't think that the problem that Your Honor -- if the problem that Your Honor has identified is a problem, you would have seen it already. Are you -- are you relying on court -- other court of appeals decisions that says ""actual knowledge"" means you had access to the information, the information was available to you? Have -- what courts have held that? So the -- the -- the -- the Eighth Circuit decision that created the conflict and -- and -- and that this case created the conflict with, held that when you've received the information, you have actual -- you have it.
I mean, the statute says had actual knowledge.
So -- But are there other -- so we have the Eighth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit. And the -- the Second Circuit interpreted the language ""had actual knowledge"" in a different context.
We discuss this in our brief.
So it's not a precise holding on this issue.
But it interpreted it in a way that we've interpreted it in a -- in a related ERISA statute of limitations context. And then you have the consensus in the district courts, which actually have got to grapple with this issue as a practical matter in case after case after case.
They've all come to the conclusion that you should read the actual knowledge standard to be satisfied when you can demonstrate that the -- that the plan participant has -- How -- how many district courts? So I think there are -- I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but I think it's at least a half a dozen or so, maybe more than that, that have grappled with it and they've all come to that conclusion. And so -- and I think there's a reason for that, because it's -- it's an understanding that the way this system is supposed to work is that plan par -- plan participants are supposed to be apprised of the information they need to, in the words of the Senate report of 1974, police their rights. And the way -- and they're given an express private right of action in ERISA to police their rights.
And so -- It is difficult to imagine a half dozen out of 98, 99 district courts as establishing a firm pattern, but put that aside. You were -- not you, but I think whoever handled this case below -- was asked whether a comatose person who received an email with this plan disclosure, would that person have actual knowledge? Could you answer that question? And let's put aside the comatose person.
Is there an obligation on plan participants to actually open emails? There's no legal obligation to do that.
And with respect to some -- So how -- I know plenty of people who never open emails or only open emails from certain individuals or in certain situations.
So, under your theory of the case, those people, the knowledge is imputed merely because they received the email? So let me take the comatose person first, that I think in extreme cases like that, the way the law would handle it is the way the law always handles it, through the doctrine of equitable tolling.
In a situation like that, I can't imagine that equitable tolling wouldn't apply in that kind of an extreme case. Now I will say -- How about -- how about handling it through the language of the statute, actual knowledge? That person doesn't have actual knowledge. Well, I think but then the -- the problem with reading it that way is you create a situation in which there can never be summary judgment in one of these cases with respect to the three-year statute of limitations, and so you're imposing very substantial burdens on -- No, no, no -- -- virtually everyone else. -- there's -- there's plenty of emails that I get that require me to say that I've read the terms and conditions. Yes, Your Honor, but I think that what the -- what the plaintiff -- Your Honor wouldn't do this, but what a plaintiff would do in that situation, I think, would say yes, I clicked on the box, but I didn't actually read them, so I didn't actually have knowledge. And I do think that points up something about the argument my friends on the other side make.
They do say on page 1 of their brief, well, if you read it, you have actual knowledge. But you don't actually have -- proof of you read it doesn't establish subjective awareness. Well, there's always a possibility that a plaintiff under oath will tell the truth. Of course.
Of course, that's right, Your Honor, but -- And so he'll say, I read it.
And his attorney will say if you read it and you say you didn't, you're in trouble. That's correct, Your Honor. All right.
So what's the problem? But even in the best of circumstances, the -- the -- people's ability to recollect whether they read things four or five and six years earlier, I think, is going to be, you know, quite -- Well, if they didn't read it -- I mean, you've been -- you've heard the argument.
I mean, if they didn't -- if they didn't read it, I mean, why -- why -- why should they? I mean, these are ordinary workers across the country.
They don't read everything.
And if they didn't read it, then they didn't read it.
Then it's six years they have.
Why -- why is that a problem? Well, I think it's a problem for -- for -- I can think of at least three reasons why it's a problem.
You're going to -- you're -- you're taking the period in which a plan is subject to hindsight bias with respect to its investment decisions and doubling it from three years to six years, which means not only are the plans going to be vulnerable to litigation over that whole six-year period, but the amount of damages could be considerably higher. And I would think, if anything, in a case where you're talking about breach of fiduciary duty, what you'd want is an intervention sooner rather than later to get to -- to -- to cure the breach.
So that seems to me a very substantial problem and a problem that inures to the detriment of plan participants, of course, because those are costs to the plan and those -- and that kind of excessive liability can discourage the creations of plans in the first place, which is why this Court has always said you -- you have to approach ERISA in a balanced manner.
And that kind of balance is what we're advocating for here. Second, I think it will introduce an element of randomness and inadministrability to the statute because it's always -- virtually always -- maybe there's going to be the rare case that Your Honor hypothesized where the -- where the -- the plaintiff testifies, yes, I did read it; yes, I did remember it.
But, in most cases, it's going to be inferences from circumstantial evidence.
And I think it's going to be some courts going one way based on inferences from circumstantial evidence, other courts going a different way based on inferences -- inferences from the same kind of -- Mr. Verrilli, you seem to -- What would the circumstantial evidence be? Well, I -- you know, I suppose it would be evidence like we had in this case, that -- that -- that the plaintiff visited the website 68 times and clicked on 1,000 links and -- and clicked on -- in particular on a link that said that he was going to attend a seminar explaining the investment options, which he then said he didn't attend.
I mean -- but I think that's what -- you're just going to have random results in district court. And I think with respect to a statute of limitations, one thing that one would want is consistent application so that -- Mr. Verrilli, we have -- we have consistent application.
We have a backstop of six years, as Justice Ginsburg's pointed out.
And these are very good policy arguments for maybe making that shorter, but those aren't our -- that's not our province. That belongs across the street. So I guess I'm wondering, what -- what cut do these policy arguments have? You're not suggesting that an irrational Congress -- only an irrational Congress could -- could come up with a scheme in which six years is the backstop, such that it's -- you know, it would be beyond the pale to imagine a Congress -- Well, I would -- -- that could come up with a scheme that would require -- May I answer? Yes. Thank you. So, Justice Gorsuch, what I -- with respect to that, I think that you have to impart the rationality to Congress also with respect to the three years, that it's in there for a reason. Uh-huh. The reason is to protect plans when they have -- Well, both sides agree that there's a reason for it.
They just disagree what that reason is. Well, I -- but I think -- respectfully, what I would suggest is -- All right. -- we're -- we're suggesting a real reason that makes sense in light of the disclosure obligations.
They're coming a hair's breadth within reading it out of the statute. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wessler. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress said that a plaintiff must have actual knowledge, it meant what we all understand that phrase to mean, that the plaintiff himself must have real awareness.
The ordinary definition of ""actual knowledge"" controls here because it accords with the fundamental rule that statutory interpretation begins and often ends with the plain meaning of the text. Congress chose to require actual knowledge, not constructive knowledge, before the general six-year limitations period for breach of fiduciary duty claims will be cut in half, and that deliberate decision must be honored. Now a common-sense distinction I think is all that's necessary to resolve this case, but there are important reasons, as I think I heard just -- just now, for why Congress would have made the choice to require actual knowledge here. Setting the bar high before the six-year limitations period will be cut in half reflects what I think is a basic real-world fact.
Most people don't read these complicated financial disclosures cover to cover. If you open the Joint Appendix to almost any page, you can see why.
These documents are chock-a-block full of dense financial market projections, asset allocations, and other jargon.
People with busy lives and with little or no financial investment experience or training are not poring over these disclosures line by line to splice back every statement on the possibility that it might contain the -- the kernel of breach under ERISA. I think it's actually just to the contrary.
Because fiduciaries owe an unyielding duty to act in participants' best interests, most people trust that their fiduciaries are not breaching their obligations. Given that real-world understanding, I think it's perfectly sensible that Congress decided not to start the three-year clock running the moment a participant receives these disclosures. And -- and I want to emphasize this, I think it's all the more true because a general six-year period does provide a concrete cutoff for most breach of fiduciary duty claims, and that six-year cutoff is among the shortest general limitations period in ERISA. With Section 1113, Congress set an important balance.
Although there's a high bar to trigger the three-year exception, fiduciaries can count on six years being the outside limit. And there's almost no other limitations provision in ERISA that provides this level of protection for defendants. Well, what would -- But the problem is how easy one can say I didn't read it.
Is it your position that that's enough? If the plaintiff says, I didn't read it, the court has to accept that? I mean, how -- how can the veracity of that statement be tested? Well, I -- I think that there are a number of ways.
I do think that a plaintiff -- if a plaintiff did not read a statement, that is likely enough to survive summary judgment and -- and -- and take this question to a fact finder in the same way, Justice Ginsburg, that all sorts of fact-specific questions that come up in the context of statutes of limitations are not amenable to summary judgment. But, of course, as was surfaced in the first half of this argument, it is entirely possible that circumstantial evidence would prove that a plaintiff either read or knew of a particular fact. What -- what would the -- what would the circumstantial evidence be? This case, I think, provides a useful illustration.
In this case, there were pages of -- of -- of printouts of -- of websites that the plaintiff had visited. Now he testified, I didn't go to the specific pages that contained what you say is the relevant information.
And throughout the entire course of this litigation, up through now, the -- the defendants were never able to come forward with specific page views to contradict that testimony. But your position is, even with all that evidence, your client would not be subject to summary judgment, right? I -- I think there would be a disputed issue of fact at that point that would reach -- would have to go to a fact finder, that's correct.
But, again, I don't think that's any different from the way fact issues come up in the context of statutes of limitations. Well, you make -- everything that you've said makes a good policy argument for saying let's just have a six-year period because people don't read these things and they're -- they're hard to understand. But why would Congress add to the six-year statute of repose this requirement of actual knowledge, which is very unusual in -- in statutes of limitations and will almost always prevent summary judgment? It will almost always raise a difficult factual question that requires the district court to make a credibility determination. Sure. Why would that be -- Sure. -- why would Congress think that's worthwhile? So, of course, we don't know because there is no relevant legislative history that cuts one way or the other on this question.
But, I mean, I think it's worth emphasizing that this statute covers a broad range of different kinds of breach of fiduciary duty claims. It includes, for instance, co-fiduciary claims, right, a claim in which a co-fiduciary knows that there has been a breach of a -- of a -- of -- of another fiduciary's duty of prudence to the participants or to the plan. And this three-year period triggers and incentivizes that co-fiduciary to come forward and bring a claim to minimize the losses to the plan.
That's an example of -- of -- of a kind of claim that would be subject to this three-year exception and wouldn't require any kind of, you know, fact dispute about what the co-fiduciary knew because they were involved in the decision-making. The same is true, Your Honor, for -- for claims that arise when one party is subject to the transaction that forms the basis of the breach, right? There's a whole range of prohibited transactions where the transaction itself is the breach and a party who is -- someone who is a party to that transaction has knowledge. But, in -- in all those cases, the potential plaintiff would have reason to know, right? So, if the test were reason to know, it would be easily satisfied. Well -- You wouldn't need to require actual knowledge. -- yeah, I mean, I think that -- that is entirely possible that Congress could have drafted this statute in a different way, but it chose to draft this -- this statute in this way, and I think that deliberate choice deserves and is entitled to -- to respect and it must be honored by -- by -- by this Court because it used the plain text actual knowledge, which I think, as we all sort of understand, is -- is defined in contradistinction to a -- a rule that would allow a court to imply or impute knowledge to a person who does not themselves personally -- Mr. Wessler -- -- have it. -- suppose a -- a plaintiff says, you know, I -- I did read it.
I just didn't understand it.
Does that always get -- Yes.
I -- I -- -- past summary judgment? -- don't think reading is sufficient to establish knowledge. Now, as this case comes to the Court, though, the Petitioners have asked the Court to assume that, had one just read all the relevant disclosures in this case, that reading would have imparted the necessary knowledge to know that there was a breach. And so I don't think that the Court needs to reach this question of how much did you need to read or how much did you need to understand. But your view is if -- if somebody said just I -- I didn't -- I didn't get it? I -- I -- I think that's -- that's insufficient to meet this high bar. So I don't think that if -- if -- I don't think that you could come in and say I just read it and that would be enough.
If you didn't understand it, you didn't know it. But, again, as -- as -- as the -- as the question has been presented to the Court, the only issue is whether ""actual knowledge"" means you knew it or you can -- a court can conclude as a matter of law that, even though someone didn't read it, they, nevertheless, have actual knowledge. Do you -- What if they -- they knew, yeah, I read it and I saw where they were investing, but I didn't really understand the nature of these companies they were investing in? Would that be enough? I don't think so, Your Honor.
I think that it depends on the -- So then this is meaningless, the actual knowledge is meaningless? Oh -- oh, not at all. It -- it absolutely depends on the nature of the -- of the kind of breach claim that is at issue in the case.
Again, this statute covers a broad range of different kinds of claims; in addition to the co-fiduciary claims I explained earlier, take the fact pattern that this Court had in LaRue, which was a -- which was a -- an account liquidation delay breach of fiduciary duty claim. A participant calls up the fiduciary and says: Please liquidate the assets from my account tomorrow.
A fiduciary fails to liquidate the assets, and there's a resulting loss.
Well, the -- the -- the participant in that case has actual knowledge that there's been a breach, and the three-year clock is ticking. But what Congress didn't want to have happen is exactly what the Petitioners are asking this Court to do, which is to allow fiduciaries to stick into these documents sentences, paragraphs, that will never be read and, as a result, have this three-year exception ticking before anybody really knows -- How about -- -- what's going on. -- Mr. Wessler, just coming back to the circumstances of this case or -- or the context of this case, how about a person who says, I read it, I thought I understood it, I didn't -- what I didn't really get was that it could be the foundation of an ERISA claim? Right.
So there is this, I think, separate question that is not in front of the Court right now, which is, Justice Kagan, what you've identified, how much do you need to know that there's been a breach of Now I think the Ninth Circuit articulated the correct standard in this case. But this Court is not being asked in this case to decide that question because, as -- again, as I said, as the Petitioners have framed this question, they've asked the Court to assume that all the relevant information was contained in the disclosures and that, had a participant read those disclosures, they would have the necessary knowledge. You styled this case a class action.
How does the Court determine who are the members of the court -- members of the class? That is, some will have read the disclosures, some will have not. How does the Court determine who is properly within the class of non-readers? Does every plan participant have to come into court and -- and say, I read it or I didn't read it? Sure.
So, I mean, what I think Your Honor is asking is a good question, which is whether and when individualized issues that might relate to the statute of limitations could affect class certification, and I think Rule 23 has mechanisms that are designed precisely to assist courts in making those decisions. But I think that's a Rule 23 question, not a question about how we interpret the plain words of -- of -- of this statute. It is a little bit like be careful what you wish for, isn't it? I -- I -- I understand. But I think you can find rafts of cases where courts are struggling with individualized statutes of limitations issues in all sorts of contexts. I mean, this -- this question, what does an individual know and when, doesn't just come up in this context.
It comes up in all sorts of limitations periods questions, equitable tolling, actual knowledge in a statute that says actually knew or should have known, where what's at issue is an individual's actual knowledge. And courts have developed methods to determine whether, for instance, the named plaintiff is adequate or typical or whether those individualized issues might affect the -- Is there anything here -- It's not like -- -- look, the way I listen to this theory is there is nothing, virtually nothing a fund can do to make certain that a member, or someone who has interest in it, the worker, actually does know about a bad investment decision, which is a big class of things, not the ones you brought up. Sure. Nothing.
They can put someone on the lawn shouting.
I shudder to think about the telephone calls: You must listen to the -- you know, not even that will work.
Thank goodness. But -- but, therefore, it used to be that were this legislation in a Senate committee, there would be a report, and the report would be this particular provision is likely to make a difference in the cases you mentioned, but it is not likely to make much difference in cases of bad investment decisions and there we intend a six-year statute of limitations. So my question is -- you've probably looked into this, maybe not any more, but I'd hoped you'd looked into it, and is there anything in that history that says that that's what we want, we want six-year statutes of limitations for bad investment decisions, but we'll take three-year statutes where he was, for example, and then you have the six examples you gave.
Is there anything? No.
We have -- No? I mean, no one has been able to find -- I mean, I -- Yeah, yeah. -- I wish I could tell you a different answer, but I can't.
There -- there's nothing in the history that suggests one way or the other what Congress had in mind specifically when it adopted this framework. But I will say I think that the 1987 amendments, which, you know, you heard a little bit about during the first half of the argument, indicate pretty strongly that Congress wanted to remove the one mechanism it had in place in this statute to start the clock running for a broader set of claims, which is the constructive knowledge trigger. Well, what about Mr. Verrilli's argument that that would have seemed -- in the original version, would have seemed a bit insane, right? If -- if -- if the secretary knows, you can't sue, but if you have gotten the disclosure -- Right. -- then you -- then -- Right.
So I -- sorry. No, go ahead.
Got it. So I think that is a nice and perhaps clever theory, but it's demonstrably wrong, and here's why: If you look at the original version of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1021 of the 1974 act, and it's this provision that governed those disclosures that needed to be sent to participants and those disclosures that needed to be sent to the Department of Labor, it was in effect all the way up through the 1987 amendments, those documents that were required to be sent to participants, including the SPD and a statement of the plan's assets and liabilities, were among -- were all among the documents that were also being sent to the Department of Labor. So, under the pre-amendment version, even if you kind of think maybe Congress was doing something funky with actual knowledge, participants were, in fact, charged with constructive knowledge of all the documents that ERISA required fiduciaries to send to them in exactly the same way as the Department of Labor was -- had constructive knowledge of the documents that were being provided to it. So there's no gap between the constructive knowledge trigger for those documents provided to participants and those that are provided to the Department of Labor. And I think, you know, what we can see, given that, is that, you know, although there's no legislative history, we do have this D.C. Circuit opinion called Fink, which the court issued about a year before the 1987 amendments, and -- and what they said -- what the court said in Fink is, look, these documents that are being filed with the Department of Labor, they're complex, they're complicated, it's even hard for the Department to -- to -- to get on top of everything that's going on here. To have the clock running on this three-year exception based just on the filing of these documents doesn't seem to us to make very good sense. And shortly after that opinion, what happens? Congress amends the statute to take out that constructive knowledge trigger. Everything that was -- everything that was sent to the Department of Labor was also sent to the participants.
Was anything sent to the Department of Labor that wasn't sent to the participants? Yes, the universe of documents that went to the Department of Labor was broader than those documents that were being sent to participants, but what the participants were getting was also being sent to the Department of Labor. Well, if -- if what was sent to the Department of Labor was broader, then I don't know what's left of your argument, because the participants would be out of court based on things that were sent to the Department of Labor but never sent to them. I -- I agree.
I think on the -- on the old version -- I don't agree that that's the end for us, but I agree that under the old version of this statute, participants were -- were being charged with knowledge of documents that they themselves were not receiving. But I don't take the Petitioners here to be arguing that the fact that the Department of Labor was getting more documents suggests that the -- the language that Congress used when it -- or what had in mind when it used ""actual knowledge"" was something other than the ordinary meaning of that term. I think the argument in their view is how -- how would it make sense if the participants were getting documents and didn't have any constructive knowledge being assessed against them based on those documents.
That, I think, does -- is not borne out based on the original version of the statute that was in place up through the amendments. I think just to return to -- to the one kind of final point I'd like to make, which is that when you boil it down, the Petitioners' argument amounts to a theory that ""actual knowledge"" really means implied actual knowledge.
A court can imply something even if an individual personally doesn't have it. But that's about as oxymoronic as it sounds.
And Section 1113 doesn't contain an implied ""implied."" And reading that term into the statute here would essentially do the exact opposite of what Congress deliberately chose to do when it eliminated any constructive knowledge trigger in 1987. What would you do with cases of willful blindness? I mean, suppose somebody says, you know, I am specifically not going to read this because I want to keep my three-year statute of limitations? Right.
So, I mean, just to be clear, willful blindness, all it is, is a jury instruction.
So it doesn't permit a court to impute as a matter of law anything about an individual's knowledge.
It's the ostrich instruction.
You know, you stuck your head in the sand and a jury gets to decide as a -- as the fact finder -- although, here, it would be a judge because we're in ERISA -- you know, whether -- whose credibility -- who's credible and what that actually means. But I will say Congress knows how to adopt willful blindness into a knowledge statute.
It has done so on many occasions.
It writes a statute, it says you either have actual knowledge of a fact or you took action to avoid obtaining such knowledge.
There are dozens of statutes that look like that. Congress has not done that here. Tell me what -- So that person still has the six-year statute? I mean, willful blindness has never been imported into ERISA, and -- and I don't think there's any statutory basis to do so here, Justice Kagan.
As yourself -- as you pointed out earlier, willful blindness itself is not the same as actual knowledge.
And I think that's what this Court said -- Well, but, counsel -- -- in Global-Tech. -- you started this by -- by acknowledging that often it is a jury instruction.
And -- and my understanding is similar, that it's -- it can be evidence -- Yes. -- of actual knowledge. Yes. Right? That if someone protests too much that they have failed -- that they don't know anything about it, I was -- I had my head stuck in the sand over here, a reasonable juror can say I just don't believe that and I want to -- that's actually evidence that you knew what was going on. And -- and you're not suggesting that that kind of use of willful blindness is impermissible here, are you? I -- I -- I think that -- just -- just to back up, since we're in ERISA, you know, you're -- you wouldn't be in front of a jury. Of course. You would have -- Of course. -- a judge making this fact-finding decision, and I think absolutely, at that stage, credibility plays an enormous role and -- and likely will play an enormous role in whether somebody was -- was either not being accurate when they said they didn't read something or that they didn't understand it. And I think that's precisely the way that these statutes of limitations issues get resolved when they pass through the summary judgment stage to -- to reach a fact finder. But I guess what I'd -- my fault for not expressing the question clearly enough, but does one get past the summary judgment stage if it's clear that one was being willfully blind? I -- I still think that there's a -- yes, because I still think there's a credibility issue in play, and willful blindness itself is a fact-finding tool.
It's a -- it's a -- it's -- it's an instruction to the fact finder to draw inferences about an individual's behavior or conduct. Can I follow up on one question Justice Ginsburg asked, which -- and read you something in the reply brief? The reply brief says ""the need for individualized timing determinations should preclude class certification in virtually every case."" And I just want to give you a chance to respond to that. If I may.
I mean, we -- we don't agree with that characterization.
And it may be that in certain cases individualized issues will pose difficulties for certifying classes.
You can find that across the range of statutes of limitations issues when they arise at the Rule 23 stage.
But to say as a -- as a matter of -- that it's a categorical rule that that would be true is, I think, inaccurate and -- and would -- would, I think, undermine the point of Rule 23 itself. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guarnieri. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case can begin and end with the plain language of Section 1113(2).
The three-year limitations period in Section 1113(2) begins to run only when the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the breach or violation.
To have actual knowledge, the plaintiff's knowledge must exist as a matter of fact.
Knowledge that is imputed or implied to the plaintiff as a matter of law does not suffice.
That is what ""actual"" means in this context.
If that standard is not met, then the default six-year period in Section 1113(1) governs the timeliness of the plaintiff's claims. Now Petitioners argue that in applying Section 1113(2), a court should presume that the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the contents of the ERISA disclosures that the plaintiff receives at the precise moment that the plaintiff receives them, even if the plaintiff indisputably never read those disclosures. That approach cannot be squared with the language of the statute.
In ordinary English, no one would say that a person has actual knowledge of the contents of a document that the person has never read.
So too here, the three-year period begins to run only when a plaintiff is, in fact, aware of the relevant information.
Constructive knowledge is not sufficient. How far do you go with the requirement of actual knowledge? The question that was asked earlier, do you have to understand what the words mean? Or -- Yes, we think you do, Mr. Chief Justice. So even if it's in -- you'd say you have actual knowledge of the significance of the information, even though you don't know what a leveraged, diversified, you know, hedge, whatever is? As a general matter, the statute requires knowledge, and we think knowledge connotes that there has to be some degree of comprehension. Now, as Mr. Wessler alluded to earlier, there is a distinct question not presented here, which is, you know, what do you need to have actual knowledge of, what does it mean to have actual knowledge of the breach or violation? But at least with respect to the question here, I mean, the statute requires actual knowledge.
And we think that means you have to sort of actually be aware of the relevant information. One can imagine, to -- to take a simple example, one can imagine a circumstance in which the -- the plan participant does not speak English and receives disclosures that are written in English. And in that case, I think it would be silly to say that the -- the plan participant, nonetheless, should be conclusively presumed to have actual knowledge of the contents of disclosures that, by hypothesis, that plaintiff would not have understood even if she had read them. I -- I'd like to follow through on the Justice -- the Chief Justice's question.
I am reading it, actual knowledge of the breach or violation.
Let's assume someone read it.
Go through Justice Kagan's question, earlier questions. Someone read it and says: I didn't understand it was a breach.
I didn't understand it was a violation. If -- if you do not understand -- I read the facts. I read it.
I saw it.
I saw exactly what was here, the distribution of investment here. Well, if -- if you do not understand the disclosures that you have received, we do not think that as a matter of ordinary English you can be said to have actual knowledge of the contents of those disclosures. Now, stepping back, as a general matter, with respect to that separate question that I alluded to earlier, what is the breach or violation, you know, what is it that you have to have actual knowledge of, in -- every court to examine that has concluded that you do not need to have knowledge that it is a legal violation of ERISA.
So we don't think the standard would go that far. But, you know, if the -- if the testimony is, if the evidence is that the plaintiff says, you know, I -- I looked at that disclosure, but I -- I did not understand the import of the terms used in that -- in it, then -- That's a -- -- you -- you have not met -- -- line that -- -- the actual knowledge standard. I'm having -- that line is what I don't understand. But, in any event, the conclusive legal presumption of actual knowledge that Petitioners are seeking in this case is nothing like that. The rule that Petitioners are advocating here would impute to every plan participant actual knowledge of the contents of all of the mandatory ERISA disclosures that the -- that the plaintiff receives. Mr. Guarnieri, I mean, if we're going to be a textualist, it's -- it's actual knowledge of the breach or the violation. It's not actual knowledge of the contents of the disclosure statement.
So that would suggest that your position has to go even further, that you have to have actual knowledge of the breach, meaning that you need to know that, you know, whatever investment allocation it was, in fact, breached ERISA. Well, I -- I don't think that that's correct, Justice Kagan.
We don't think you actually have to know that it was a legal violation of ERISA.
We think in that respect, the Ninth Circuit got this basically right in its articulation of the standard. The -- the idea is that the plaintiff has to have actual knowledge of the essential nature of the breach or violation. So that makes sense. So it's generally -- I guess I'm just pointing out that that's not -- I mean, if you're really taking the text seriously, I think you would come out in a different place. Well, we are trying to take the text quite seriously and we do think Congress used precise language in -- in this particular limitations provision, which requires actual knowledge as opposed to simply knowledge. But, you know, to know that there's a breach, I think, in this context, for example, in a -- in a duty of prudence, if the -- if the claim is that the fiduciary violated the duty of prudence, then the plaintiff would need to know that what the fiduciary did was imprudent but not necessarily that what the fiduciary did violated ERISA. And the same would be true for claims sounding in the duty of loyalty or prohibited transactions.
You need to know sort of the essential nature of the wrongdoing but not that it violated ERISA. But, look, you have a strong textual argument.
There's no question about that. But even putting aside the issue of whether the potential plaintiff has to know that it was a breach, even assuming that all the plaintiff has to know are the facts constituting the breach, why would Congress think it was worthwhile to put this actual knowledge requirement in? Why not just have the six-year period in recognition of the fact that a lot of people, maybe most people, maybe nearly everybody, doesn't read these things, doesn't understand them.
Why is it worth the effort? Well, Justice Alito, I think the statute reflects the following intuition.
I mean, the -- the -- the six-year provision really is the backstop.
So, in general, you have six years from the breach or violation in order to bring suit. The three-year provision only comes into play if the plaintiff acquires actual knowledge of the breach or violation, in years 1, 2, or 3, because after that point, the six-year period will expire before the three-year period. Yeah, I under -- So, basically, the information is -- -- I understand that. But -- but, you know, putting aside the -- the -- the super honest plaintiff who is an expert on investments and actually did read it and actually did understand it and testifies, yeah, okay, you got me, I did it, what else is this going to achieve? The idea is that the plaintiff who does happen to acquire actual knowledge of the relevant information within those first three years can be expected to bring suit within three years and does not need the full six-year period in which to bring suit. And -- I think Mr. -- keep going. There are -- there are reasons that Congress would not have wanted a plaintiff in those circumstances.
The plaintiff who really does have actual knowledge to delay bringing suit, delay bringing -- many of these suits are brought for the benefit of the plan as a whole, and a delay of a substantial period of time -- of time can redound to the disadvantage of other plan participants who would have been better served had the suit been brought earlier. I think -- That's the basic logic of having the two standards in the statute. I think Mr. Verrilli's point, though, is that it's impossible to prove actual knowledge under the answers that have been given here, and, therefore, you end up with a de facto six-year statute of limitations, which is very unusual, a long period of time, going to cause a lot of negative consequences, he says, and, therefore, that context means that we must be reading actual knowledge wrong.
So -- Well -- -- how do you respond to that? -- of course, we -- we disagree with Mr. Verrilli's articulation of the policy balance that's at issue here. But just to take the question on directly, there are many reported decisions applying the actual knowledge standard to find a suit is time barred even under the correct understanding of the statute, meaning the knowledge must, in fact, be actual and not merely imputed to the plaintiff as a matter of law. Now -- Well, give me an example where that could be done on summary judgment, a real-world, realistic example of where that could be done on summary judgment. Well, for example, I mean, a common fact pattern is that a plan participant will consult with another financial professional who will explain to the plan participant, you know, the investments that are in your retirement fund are imprudent for someone in your circumstances. A conversation like that would give that plaintiff actual knowledge of the breach or violation if the claim is that the investment was imprudent.
So -- and that's not fanciful. There are cases like that. So it's -- it's not the case that rejecting the rule that Petitioners advocate here would make the three-year limitations period a nullity.
It does have real force and effect, and it has had real force and effect in the many circuits that have adopted the correct interpretation of the statute. And on that point, I'd like to address one claim that Mr. Verrilli had earlier -- Can you -- can you make sure to address Justice Ginsburg's class certification question before you finish? Sure.
Well, I entirely agree with Mr. Wessler's answer on that question.
I mean, in general, the fact that you may have an individualized limitations defense with respect to some members of a putative class would not necessarily foreclose certification of that class, I mean, in the same way you might have a -- a -- a release and settlement defense with respect to some plaintiffs or not -- and not others.
The injuries may be different for members of the class. Well, except -- The fact that there are -- -- if you think that the actual knowledge issue would be satisfied, or requirement, in most cases.
In other words, there -- there'll be few members of a purported class action because most people are not going to have actual knowledge. Well, I -- I think in general, the Rule 23 question would be whether the -- the -- the injuries asserted by the plaintiffs are amenable to class-wide treatment. And the fact that there is a defense that might be applicable to some but not other members of their class would not necessarily preclude class certification. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Verrilli, five minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Three points: First, I'd like to return to the 1974 version of the statute and I -- and in particular to the question that Justice Gorsuch asked me at -- at the end of my opening argument. I think what we heard from my friends on the other side here is that -- there's two things.
First, that the -- with respect to the 1974 statute, the extreme anomaly that I identified is there, that it doesn't make any sense to think that the statute -- that Congress would have adopted a statute that said the three-year statute of limitations is going to be triggered based on the information provided to DOL but not on the information -- I'm sorry, Mr. -- -- provided to you. -- Verrilli, I went back to that statute, and what it says: ""On which a report from which he could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge of such brief."" I read that as potentially excluding those documents that only the secretary has.
I think your -- your adversary was right, that the documents that the individual received could give them reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge, but not necessarily those that only the secretary receives. So, Justice Sotomayor, I -- I understood my friend on the other side to say the opposite, which is to say that it would -- it wouldn't -- there was no need to have any -- any knowledge provision triggered by the disclosures that went to the individual because everything that went to the DOL was going to trigger the three years anyway. And I think, if you think about that for a minute, that blows up their whole theory of the statute, because what they're saying is in 1974 Congress enacted a statute that was actually quite harsh, that the default was going to be a three-year statute of limitations if the information sufficient to show breach was sent to DOL whether you got it or not. It would actually be the odd case that was the six years under that theory, not the normal case. And -- and, of course, when Congress amended the statute in 1987, it did not change the words ""had actual knowledge."" So the meaning you're trying to ascertain is the meaning that those words had in 1974. And so I -- I just think that their whole -- the whole theory, nobody reads as a -- you know, that's all blown up by their -- what they said about what happened in 1974. Now the second point, if I could, with respect to the -- the -- Justice Breyer, you asked about consequences and there was a robust discussion about the class action impact here. I -- I do think what my friends on the other side are saying essentially is that -- they didn't put it exactly this way, they spoke at a higher level of abstraction -- but, basically, what they're saying is here's what will happen in class actions.
You'll just defer the question of whether there's a statute of limitations defense to the remedial phase. And then you'll have trials at the remedial phase of a class action about whether every single one of the class members had this actual knowledge or not based on these kinds of circumstantial proof that we were talking about. Just think of what a catastrophe that's going to be in the class action context. So, in the unlikely event that this Court disagrees with our position on the merits, I would hope that there would be clarity here as to how this -- this reading will play out in a class action context, because that would be a staggering, enormous negative consequence. After all, it does put the cart before the horse because statute of limitations is a threshold defense.
And so the idea that you would do it in that manner I think is just -- I -- it's a catastrophic problem. And then, with respect to the discussion, the colloquy on willful blindness, I understand my friend's position that it's just a jury instruction that allows an inference of actual knowledge.
But, respectfully, I don't think that's the way this Court described it in the Global-Tech decision. The Court basically said, as I read Global-Tech, that -- that it's not -- that proof of willful blindness, proof of the circumstances that would allow you to establish willful blindness, is not proof of subjective awareness, but it's something that you might consider as being just as culpable or that -- or -- or that they, in effect, have actual knowledge but not that they actually have actual knowledge.
It's an imputation. I -- I just think that's as clear as can be from what this Court said in Global-Tech. And so I think the question here is whether in this very different context, where, you know, as I said, these actual knowledge standards come virtually exclusively from criminal enforcement proceedings where you're trying to measure the individual defendant's culpability. And, of course, there should be an inquiry in that situation into the specific state of mind of the defendant.
That's what the whole culpability inquiry is about. Here, you're talking about a statute of limitations.
And in particular -- if I might finish -- a statute of limitations that's designed this three-year period to protect the interests of defendants.
And so it's important to balance those interests when reading the statute. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1323, June Medical Services versus Russo, and the cross-petition, 18-1460, Russo versus June Medical Services. Ms. Rikelman. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about respect for the Court's precedent.
Just four years ago, the Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The Louisiana law at issue here, Act 620, is identical to the Texas law and was expressly modeled on it.
After a trial, the district court ruled Act 620 unconstitutional, finding no material differences between this case and Whole Woman's Health.
On burdens, it found that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions.
At the same time, it found that Act 620 would do nothing for women's health. In reversing the district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit committed two fundamental errors.
First, it usurped the role of the district court and disregarded nearly all of its factual findings.
Second, the Fifth Circuit accepted legal arguments that this Court rejected four years ago. Nothing, however, has changed that would justify such a legal about-face.
In fact, even more medical organizations have joined the AMA and ACOG to say that admitting privileges impose barriers to abortion with no benefit to patients and that this impact is not state dependent. Finally, the state's eleventh-hour objection to third-party standing runs up against still more binding precedent.
The Court squarely held in Craig versus Boren that such objections are waiveable, and the state deliberately and strategically waived the issue in the district court.
And even if the state could get past waiver, denying standing here would contradict decades of this Court's precedent in numerous areas of the law. In short, Petitioners have third-party standing, especially because Act 620 restricts abortion by regulating them, rather than their patients. Would you have done anything different if it had been -- if the third-party standing had been timely raised? Your Honor, we certainly could have submitted additional evidence in the court, but we believe that the evidence that is already there is sufficient to find third-party standing. This Court has squarely found third-party standing in at least four abortion cases that are on point, as well as a number of other cases such as Meyer, Craig, Carey, and the Court's cases have been consistent in saying that a plaintiff who is directly regulated by a law has third-party standing. Would you agree with the general proposition that a party should not be able to sue ostensibly to protect the rights of other people, if there is a real conflict of interest between the party who is suing and those whose rights the party claims to be attempting to defend? No, Your Honor, not if that party is directly regulated by the law in question.
And, in fact, this Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where the state argued that the third parties were protected by the law and in a sense protected from the plaintiffs. Really? That's amazing.
You think that if the plaintiff actually has interests that are directly contrary to those of the -- those individuals on whose behalf the plaintiff is claiming to sue, nevertheless that plaintiff can have standing? If the plaintiff is directly regulated by the law.
This Court has allowed an attorney to bring third-party claims against a statute that capped attorneys' fees in favor of clients. Well, that's amazing. Let's -- I mean -- I -- I -- suppose -- I know you think that the admitting privileges requirement serves no safety purpose, but suppose that the regulation that was being challenged was one that a lot of people might think really did serve a safety purpose. Let's say we're in a state where physicians' assistants can perform abortions, and a -- an abortion clinic wants to challenge the training requirements for physicians' assistants.
It just thinks those are too onerous and there's no justification for them. Now, if they're wrong about that, it implicates the interests of the women who may want to get an abortion, but you would say the clinic nevertheless can sue on behalf of those women? This Court has squarely held in many cases that a plaintiff directly regulated by the law can sue, and those cases make sense for at least two reasons, Your Honor. First, because a plaintiff should not be subject to severe penalties under an unconstitutional rule.
And, second, if the plaintiff is the one directly regulated, then they're -- it makes sense that they are the appropriate plaintiff. And that -- And that's clearly true -- That sounds -- that sounds like a direct standing, not third-party standing.
But in this case, is there anything like the conflict that Justice Alito had mentioned? Is there a conflict? No, Your Honor, there is not even a plausible conflict in this case because this Court already held that admitting privileges served no medical benefit, and the district court here, after a trial, specifically found that this law would serve no benefit and, in fact, would harm the health of women in Louisiana. But, you know, your argument is using the merits to defeat -- to -- to support standing.
There's a serious problem with that. No, Your Honor.
I believe it's the state that's collapsing standing and merits.
And, again, this Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where one could argue that the state law in question was protecting third parties from the plaintiffs. In addition to Triplett, that was the issue in Craig versus Boren.
The law there was a state law in Oklahoma, and the state claimed that it was designed to protect young men from buying beer in order to make sure that they were safe and didn't get into traffic accidents. Counsel -- That -- -- is this -- I -- I'm just wondering, are these doctors in any different position than potential plaintiffs, women, who feel burdened by this law? No, Your Honor.
And, in fact, the state has not pointed to a single thing that would have been different if one woman had been joined in this lawsuit. To the contrary, the issues that the state says are the key issues in this case, whether this law serves health and safety benefits and how difficult it is for physicians to obtain privileges, are issues that the physicians are particularly well suited to litigate. And, again, this is a law -- So the point is you have standing on behalf of those women who feel burdened? Yes, Your Honor. To the extent that other women may not have brought a suit, that's irrelevant to the fact that there are some, those burdened, who could have and would have, if situations had permitted them to? That's absolutely right -- Well, then -- -- Your Honor. -- why can't -- why shouldn't they be the ones to bring suit? Your Honor, this is a law that restricts abortion by regulating the physicians, rather than their patients.
And so it's appropriate for them to be the plaintiffs here. Again, the -- Well, but -- -- state has pointed to -- -- the -- the constitutional right at issue is not a constitutional right of abortion clinics, is it? It's a right of women. That's correct, Your Honor, but in order for women to access their right to abortion, they need to be able to access those services. Do -- do you think a party can have third-party -- there can be third-party standing if there is no hindrance whatsoever to the bringing of suit by the people whose rights are at stake? This Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where the law directly regulates the plaintiff without a showing of hindrance.
For instance, in Craig versus Boren, there was clearly no hindrance. But I would also say that the Court doesn't need to reach these issues here because the state strategically and deliberately waived third-party standing. Well, I think that's highly debatable that they waived it.
They certainly didn't raise it in the district court, but whether they -- they affirmatively waived it is quite debatable. Your Honor at JA 45, the state explicitly conceded third-party standing and urged the district court to reach the undue burden claim, saying that it had a keen interest in removing any cloud upon the validity of its law, that this case was the proper vehicle for doing so. It's a -- it's a highly debatable interpretation of that passage, which I've read numerous times. What the state was saying was that the -- while the temp -- if a temporary restraining order was issued, the lawsuit should continue to go forward.
And they said there wouldn't be an impediment to the lawsuit going forward, because the doctors would have standing. And what I think they may have been saying in that instance is that they would have standing under the law that was applicable at that time.
We -- and we could debate what was actually said, but I think it's quite a stretch of the record for you to say there was an affirmative waiver. Your Honor, at JA 45 there was a deliberate waiver.
And the -- and the state did it strategically because it was attempting to take advantage of favorable Fifth Circuit precedent at the time because the Fifth Circuit had just upheld the Texas admitting privileges law. Again, the state specifically urged the district court to decide the undue burden claim, saying that this case was the proper -- proper vehicle for resolving the constitutional issues and that any delay wouldn't serve judicial efficiency. It wasn't raised in -- in the district court or in the court of appeals.
It was -- it cropped up in a -- wasn't it a cross-petition for cert? That's correct, Your Honor. And might you have, if you had a timely notice, just as insurance, joined a patient or two? Yes, Your Honor.
And, in fact, it would be profoundly unfair to allow the state to raise the objection for the first time five years into this litigation after it urged the district court to decide the undue burden claim and then pursued the undue burden claim through multiple rounds of appeals. It didn't even raise the issue when this case came before the Court in 2016 on the stay.
The first time that it raised an objection was when it filed its cross-petition for cert. And, again, at JA 45, it deliberately and strategically waived this issue. How many abortion cases has -- has the Court either expressly or silently allowed the doctors to sue on behalf of the women? I -- I counted eight, but maybe that's overstating it. How many abortion cases in this Court? At least eight, Your Honor.
And I believe at least four of them squarely allowed standing in precisely these circumstances. So if we didn't in this case, it would require either directly or indirectly overruling eight cases of this Court? That's correct.
And, in fact, in Danforth and Akron the same type of law was at issue.
It was a law that the state claimed was designed to protect the health and safety of women but the Court allowed the physicians to bring the claim and to show that, in fact, the law didn't further health and safety. In how many of those cases did the Court discuss the issue of conflict of interest? The Court in Danforth specifically said that the plaintiffs had standing.
It wasn't discussed in terms of the words conflict, Your Honor, but, again, the same types of arguments were in front of the Court -- Was it -- -- because the state -- Was it a footnote in Danforth? I don't believe so, Your Honor.
I believe it was a foot -- footnote in Akron but in Danforth it was -- Yeah, but -- You made a point about Craig against Boren, that the ostensible purpose of the law was to save the vulnerable young men from the evils of 3.2 beer? That's correct, Your Honor, and the Court allowed the saloon keeper to bring the third-party standing claim.
Again, in Triplet the Court allowed an attorney to challenge a law designed to cap attorneys' fees. And in Carey the Court allowed a mail order contraceptive company to challenge a law that was designed to limit the prescription of contraceptives to pharmacists, again, claiming that that was about protecting the health and safety of people. So the Court has allowed third-party standing in many cases that are squarely on point. Counsel, do you agree that the inquiry under Hellerstedt is a factual one that has to proceed state-by-state? Your Honor, I think that facts may vary, but what we know is that the district court held a trial here and found that there were no material differences between this case and -- No, no, I know, but if -- if the issue, the statutes are on the books in other states, and if the issues are raised there, is the same inquiry required in each case? You have to have the district court examine the availability of specific clinics and the admitting privileges of doctors so that the litigation could be -- the results could be different in different states? Two points, if I may, Your Honor.
This Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law was medically unnecessary and its burdens were undue.
That holding should clearly apply to Louisiana's identical law, and certainly the Court's reasoning is applicable in Louisiana. Now, the burdens of a law may vary, but a law that has no benefits and doesn't serve any valid state interest is much more likely to impose an undue burden.
And -- If a -- if a state passed an admitting privileges law therefor, and suppose a state had ten clinics and two doctors for each clinic, but all 20 doctors could easily get the admitting privileges, so that there'd be no effect on the clinics, no effect on the doctors who perform abortions, and, therefore, no effect on the women who obtain abortions, would a law be constitutional in that state? That law may still be unconstitutional if it's restricting access because of the 30-mile limit, Your Honor, but that's very different from the situation here where the district court concluded -- If it didn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- if it didn't, though, put aside the 30-mile, assume all the doctors who currently perform abortions can obtain admitting privileges, could you say that the law still imposes an undue burden, even if there were no effect? That law would have no benefit, Your Honor, and it may pose a much harder question than this case. But in this case the district court after a trial explicitly found that the burdens of this law would be severe, and it would leave only one physician to serve 10,000 people per year in the entire state.
And the -- Well, the Fifth Circuit went through what the district court had said about the various doctors.
And it was proper for the Fifth Circuit to review the district court's findings for clear error, was it not? Yes, Your Honor.
Clear error is the standard.
And we believe that the district court's findings are more than plausible under the standard here. Well, let's take one example.
Let's take Doe Number 2.
Doe Number 2 is a plaintiff in this case, right? Yes, Your Honor. So he had -- he didn't have -- it would be counter to his own interests for him to make a super effort to get admitting privileges, wouldn't it, because he'd be defeating his own claim? No, Your Honor.
Doe 2's -- brought this lawsuit to protect the rights of his patients.
And the district court found that he was competent and qualified and that he made good faith efforts to obtain -- All right.
So if -- all right.
We can argue about whether he had a conflict of interest or not. He previously had admitting privileges at a hospital in the Shreveport area, did he not? Yes, Your Honor. A predecessor of Christus Schumpert? Yes, Your Honor. He testified that he didn't apply for admitting privileges there because it's a Catholic hospital; isn't that right? That was part of the testimony.
But, in addition, the bylaws of that hospital showed that there would be admissions requirements that Doe 2 couldn't meet. All right.
Well, he testified directly: I did not apply there because it's a Catholic hospital.
Is that not correct? That's correct, Your Honor. All right.
Doe Number 3 performs abortions, does he not? Yes. Doe Number 3 has admitting privileges there? He has admitting privileges that require 50 admissions per year which he is able to satisfy because he has an obstetrics practice.
And that's why he was the only physician with privileges. The state's own credentialing expert in this case conceded that outpatient physicians like these who never intend to treat patients in the hospital will not be able to get privileges, and the hospital bylaws included many criteria that these physicians could never satisfy -- When Doe -- -- including residency. -- Number 2 explained why he didn't apply to this hospital, he said, in part, because it's not a place where I would feel comfortable.
Didn't he say that? He did, Your Honor. Doe 2 focused his efforts on hospitals where he thought he had the best chance of obtaining privileges.
He had had privileges at LSU and wasn't even able to get privileges there. Did the district court mention any of these facts? Yes, Your Honor.
The district court's opinion was very careful, and its -- its decision and finding that these physicians would not be able to get privileges was based on at least four points. One, the fact that they applied and attempted to get privileges at 15 hospitals over one-and-a-half years. Two, that the state's key credentialing expert conceded that physicians who never intended to treat patients in the hospital will not get privileges. Footnote: That's Doctor Number 6. All of these physicians are outpatient physicians, Your Honor.
I think -- No, but Number 6 is only a medical doctor. That's correct. He hasn't done any surgical procedures since 2004 and 2005. That's correct.
And the state's expert also conceded that a physician who provides only medication and counseling would never be able to get privileges. In addition, the district court's burdens findings were supported by what happened when this law actually took effect for a brief time in 2016 and abortion access in Louisiana was devastated. And, of course, the finding of every district court that has held a trial on a similar law has been that these laws will restrict access to abortion.
And here the district court found that this law would leave Louisiana with just one clinic in one state to serve about 10,000 people per year. And that would mean that hundreds of thousands of women would now live more than 150 miles from the closest provider.
And the burdens were actually more severe than this Court found in Whole Woman's Health. Can we go to Doe 3, the doctor who had the active OB-GYN practice? He's only a part-time doctor in Hope. That's correct. There's been much talk about his statement or findings by the district court that he was a superseding cause to the Act because he, on his own, will not practice in that -- in Hope if this law goes into effect because he would be the only doctor. But putting that aside, he also testified -- I'm sorry -- the Hope manager testified that he only does a limited number of abortions, and without the other doctor, that clinic would have to close. That's absolutely right, Your Honor.
The district court found that without Doe 1, the primary provider at Hope, Hope would not be a viable going concern. So regardless of Doe 3's testimony, Hope would have to close because Doe 3 was providing fewer than 30 percent of the abortion services of that clinic. The primary provider was unable to get privileges, and Hope would close, meaning that women living in northern Louisiana would now have to travel hundreds of additional miles, for a law that has no benefit, in order to access abortion services. Could I -- There's no dispute here about Doe 1. That's correct. The other side, that finding it says it's right.
Now Doe 3, whether or not he would quit or not, the clinic would have to close because it wouldn't have a Doe 1? Correct. So, at least with respect to that.
With respect to Doe 6, that's a medical doctor only who hasn't been in a hospital for over ten years.
So it seems implausible, given that every single hospital mentioned by the district court in that area has requirements of in-patient -- of receiving patients by the doctor, and he can't fulfill that under any circumstances, correct? That's correct. All right. Can I follow up on the Chief Justice's earlier question and mine as well? Are you saying that admitting privileges laws are always unconstitutional, such that we don't have to look at the facts in -- state by state? Or are you saying that actually you do look at the facts state by state, and in some states, admitting privileges laws could be constitutional, if they impose no burdens? Your Honor, the burdens may vary, but a law that has no benefit and serves no valid state interest, which is what this Court held in Whole Woman's Health, is much more likely to be an undue burden. Could an admitting privileges law of this kind ever have a valid purpose, in your view? No, Your Honor.
The medical consensus against these laws is clear. So your view is that they're unconstitutional in any state, regardless of the facts? They certainly serve no valid state interest.
And, in fact, the district court here found that this law was a solution for a problem that didn't exist and would actually jeopardize this -- health and safety of people -- Would this be -- -- in Louisiana. -- different if -- if they did something as limited as, for example, you have to be admitted somewhere, because some -- being admitted somewhere does further credentialing benefits? But this was you have to be admitted within 30 miles.
Some of these doctors were admitted further away, but they still were credentialed by someone, correct? That's correct, Your Honor.
If credentialing were the true goal of this law, the 30-mile limit would make no sense. And one of the practical real-world impacts, if this law were to take effect, is that women in the Baton Rouge area would now have to travel 320 miles back and forth to New Orleans to see the same exact physician that they previously could have seen -- How many -- -- in Baton Rouge. -- miles from the northern -- from the Hope area? It's 320 miles, Your Honor, from Shreveport to New Orleans.
And from Baton Rouge back and forth, because of the two-trip law, it's 320 miles.
And, again, they would be making that trip to see the same exact physician who had been previously providing services in Baton Rouge.
And that has no benefit to women's health.
It will only hurt their health, which is exactly what the district court found here. You haven't mentioned, and it's odd, the 30 mile from the clinic, when most of these abortions don't have any complications and the patient never gets near a hospital, but if she needs a hospital, it's certainly not going to be the one near the clinic.
She will be home. That -- And so -- That's exactly right, Your Honor.
That's what this Court recognized in Whole Woman's Health and one of the reasons why it concluded the law is medically unnecessary, because the -- the complication rate is extremely small to begin with, but when complications do occur, it's almost always after the woman has been left the clinic. And the standard of care at that point is for her to go to the hospital closest to her home.
And, of course, about 40 percent of abortions in Louisiana are medication abortions, and any complication from those abortions will always happen when the patient is at home, which, again, is what this Court recognized in Whole Woman's Health. And that is one of the reasons why the AMA and ACOG are clear that these laws have no medical benefits whatsoever and only impose barriers to abortion.
And that is true in every state, regardless of the state circumstances. These laws will always put barriers to abortion while serving no health and safety benefits.
And, in fact, the district court here found that abortion in Louisiana in the years before the law was extremely safe, with a very low rate of complications, that Hope had an excellent safety record, and that its physicians were competent and qualified to provide abortion services. And, again, it concluded that there is no basis to distinguish this case from Whole Woman's Health and instead the burdens of this law would be even more severe than the Texas law that this Court struck down in Whole Woman's Health. Hope is the -- the name under which June Medical does business; is that correct? Yes, Your Honor. Was -- was June Medical's license suspended for regulatory violations? It was briefly, Your Honor, in 2010.
And the court heard testimony about that and rejected the state's allegations after listening to the clinic's administrator and looking at the evidence in the record.
It concluded that Hope has an excellent safety record and that its physicians are qualified and competent. Thank you, counsel. General Murrill. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit correctly held that the plaintiffs in this case failed to carry their burden -- their heavy burden of proof that is required to facially invalidate a state law. Louisiana's decision to require abortion providers to have admitting privileges was justified by abundant evidence of life-threatening health and safety violations, malpractice, noncompliance with professional licensing rules, legislative testimony from post-abortive women, testimony from doctors who took care of abortion providers' abandoned patients. The substantive due process claim that plaintiffs assert on their patients' behalf hinged upon their assertion that they would not be able to get privileges, but they can and they did.
Their claims also fail for an independent reason. So they do not meet the modern, rigorous rule for third-party standing.
So, instead, they invite this Court to exempt them from the rule. This Court should decline to make abortion providers unique among federal plaintiffs and reaffirm that even abortion providers must comply with the same rules as all the other litigants. Doctors and healthcare providers and healthcare facilities are heavily regulated for ethics reasons and for consumer protection.
And in this context, the conflict between the plaintiffs and the individuals that the law seeks to protect should defeat the close relationship prong of third-party standing. Apart from that conflict, the record shows that they do not have a close relationship with their patients and individual women have litigated abortion cases on their own for decades. I'd like to first address why this case is different from Hellerstedt and then address standing and waiver. The -- the -- the state presented abundant evidence of how this case is different. The law was different, the facts are different. The regulatory structure is different.
And the record is different.
And all of those things dictated a different result. So the Fifth Circuit focused on -- one of the things that the Fifth Circuit focused on was credentialing.
The record in this case demonstrates that there is no credentialing that is performed by these facilities.
They alleged that they had robust policies, but they don't read them and they don't follow them. What -- They -- -- sense does the 30-mile limit make, considering that -- certainly for medication abortions and for the overwhelming number of other abortions? Justice Ginsburg -- If the woman has a problem, it will be her local hospital that will -- she will need to go to for the care, not something 30 miles from the clinic, which does have no necessary relationship to where she lives. Justice Ginsburg, that regulation is consistent with the regulation that we have in our office surgery regulations and our ambulatory surgery regulations, so it is consistent with our regulatory structure. We also had evidence in the record of women who did require transfers.
I think there is at least -- Doe 3 testified unambiguously that he had to transfer four patients who had punctured uteruses and were hemorrhaging -- What about -- -- and he took care of them. What about a D&C after a miscarriage? As I understand it, these two procedures are very much alike. Are similar regulations, about 30 miles, and admitting privileges applicable to a D&C following a miscarriage? Under the ambulatory surgery center regs, yes.
Under the office practice regs which do not regulate abortion clinics, a doctor who doesn't have a -- have a residency in the proper scope of care would have to have admitting privileges and would have to have them within a 30-mile radius of -- of the clinic.
So it's the same requirement. It is the same. Yes. I thought there was something in the record suggesting there was no such requirement for D&C following a miscarriage. The office practice regulations are not as tightly regulated as ambulatory surgery centers, which are facility licensing.
These are separate licensing constructs. Facilities are licensed by the Louisiana Department of Health, as are ambulatory surgery centers.
And both require all the medical staff to have admitting privileges. The -- the requirement under ASC says geographically close, and it is interpreted under the regs as the same way.
So we don't interpret it differently.
We're applying them consistently and we're reading those regulations the same. Do you agree that the benefits inquiry under the law is going to be the same in every case, regardless of which state we're talking about? I mean, I understand the idea that the impact might be different in different places, but as far as the benefits of the law, that's going to be the same in each state, isn't it? No.
I don't think the benefit -- I mean, I think that a state could certainly show greater benefits, depending on what their regulatory structure is and what the facts are on the ground in that state.
I think we absolutely could show that we -- that it serves a greater benefit. In our situation, for example, we've demonstrated that the doctors don't do credentialing, that the -- the LSBME testimony from the executive director from Dr. Mutah in the record, at JA 1373, she testified specifically that the LSBME doesn't do credentialing for procedures. That's what the hospital would do. And that's what, if the clinic had -- I'm sorry. -- robust policies, it would do. I'm sorry.
There are laws that require credentialing to be done by the state with respect to these doctors, correct? They have to get a license and they have to have certain competencies to get the license. And they also -- the license is suspended if they're committed -- if they are convicted of a criminal act.
You're -- you're making it sound like there is no state licensing of these doctors.
They are licensed.
They are -- Justice -- -- regulated.
You -- -- Sotomayor, they are -- they are licensed by the state as -- and Doctor -- Dr. Cecllia Mouton testified specifically at JA 1373 that the Board does not do credentialing.
That is not our role. But didn't -- Our role is -- -- they also -- -- to licensing generally. -- testify that they -- but they did ensure that each of these doctors was skilled in the procedures that they were performing? No.
In fact, Doe 3 hired a radiologist and an ophthalmologist to perform abortions at one point in time.
So they clearly were not -- But he was -- -- complying. -- supervising what they were doing.
That's what he testified to. That is not within the scope of care.
And our record clearly demonstrates that you should have a residency and you should have training in the area in which you are performing surgical procedures. So it would not comply even with our office practice regs for a doctor to -- a radiologist to perform abortions.
That would not comply -- Was he doing -- -- with our standard of care. -- a surgical procedure or was he doing a medical abortion? He was performing surgical abortions, to the best of my knowledge. There is no indication that he wasn't.
I believe that the testimony is that he was performing all -- there -- he wasn't restricting his practice. There's not a lot of testimony in the record about what he -- those doctors were doing, other than he hired them. But to your -- to your question -- We're not even talking about them.
We're talking about these doctors and their credentials. And -- Oh. And I don't -- and I'm sort of still at a mystery to me why, if what's important to you is the credentialing, why the 30-mile limit has significance? Because it's not just credentialing.
It is all of the other factors that also play into it.
It does provide continuity of care.
It does cover for -- it does address -- How can the -- -- the non-compliance with health -- If there is no -- -- and safety regulations. -- continuity of care, this law itself permits a doctor to either have admitting privileges or to be in contract with someone who does. So it's not necessary that there be continuity of care in a hospital.
The -- the only thing is the credential, you said, is to make sure that they have the skill level. But if they're credentialed somewhere else, they have the skill level. Justice Sotomayor, they did not even comply with the transfer requirement.
They did not comply with multiple health -- health and safety requirements in the state. So part of what the credentialing -- Was this all -- -- part of what -- -- before the district court? Yes. All right.
And the district court looked at it and found explanations that were adequate for each and didn't come to the conclusions you did or the legislature did. I thought the standard of review for the Fifth Circuit here was whether there was a plausible basis in the record for the conclusions the district court reached? The district court judge ignored all of the health and safety violations. He ignored an entire category of courtesy privileges if we're talking about compliance.
I mean, I would -- I would like to take us back to the point that they could and did get privileges.
And their primary -- General Murrill, before you -- -- assumption from the beginning was -- -- do that -- before you do that, please.
On this credentialing point, which you've mentioned several times, and of course Whole Woman's Health discussed that and said a state can't say it's doing this for credentialing purposes if the hospital's reasons for denying admitting privileges have nothing to do with the doctor's quality. And that was true in Whole Woman's Health and it's true here, too, that there's a great deal of evidence in the record that indicates that admissions privileges rest on many things. It could rest on qualifications, but it could rest on the number of patients a doctor has.
It could rest on whether a doctor -- whether a particular hospital needs more providers. It could rest, too, it could rest on a general view that they don't want abortion providers in that hospital. So given that that's all true, it was true in Texas and it's true here, it seems that Whole Woman's Health precludes you from making this credentialing argument, doesn't it? No, I don't think that it does at all.
I mean, in our case it was demonstrably different.
They could and did get privileges.
So all of the -- the -- the conjecture and the speculation about the reasons why they might be denied privileges were proved to be untrue. Is it not -- They were able to get privileges. Is it not the fact that most hospitals in Louisiana, in order to get admitting privileges, you have to admit a certain number of patients? Abortion providers will never, if that's -- if they're not also doing obstetrics and gynecology, they will never qualify because their patients don't go to the hospital. There's one finding in that respect, and you can tell me if there's any dispute about it, but this circuit didn't seem to contest this finding of the district court, that a hospital transfer was required far less than once a year or less than one per several thousand patients. Most of the people who get abortions never have any need to go to a hospital.
Isn't that so? Justice Ginsburg, to your first point about the -- the privileging and the minimum requirements, every -- every set of bylaws in our record shows that there is a category of courtesy privileges that permits low admit from anywhere -- My question is -- -- from zero to a dozen. I -- I -- -- is there anything inaccurate about this determination that access to a hospital -- I think, yes. -- was required far less than once a year, less than one per several thousand patients? Yes.
It is inaccurate because what the record demonstrated is that they don't know what their qualification -- what their complication rates are.
They all testified that they don't know because women don't follow up with them or they don't follow up with women. So they really don't know what their complication rates are.
And they did testify that they had direct transfers that resulted in women having hysterectomies -- Well is it right -- -- and hemorrhaging. Is it -- is it right that there is evidence in the record that Hope Clinic has served over 3,000 women annually for 23 years, so that's around 70,000 women, and has transferred only four patients ever to a hospital? And there is evidence in the record that they really don't know that that's an accurate rate because they don't track their complications.
They really don't know what their numbers are. Well, they know -- So they testified -- They know whether they've transferred women to a hospital, and it's four.
I mean, I don't know of a medical procedure where it's lower than that of any kind. Justice Kagan, it's four that they know of -- You don't -- you don't -- -- and that they don't track the numbers. You don't dispute that, among medical procedures, first trimester abortion is among the safest, far safer than childbirth? Justice Ginsburg, a first-trimester abortion can be either medical or surgical.
And even if it's medical, the doctor should have the qualifications to -- to be able to handle the most likely complication of that procedure, which is a surgical abortion. So under the standard of care in Louisiana, even if it's a medical -- even if it's a medication abortion, the doctor should be able to handle a surgical abortion and be qualified to do that. I think the record is questionable about whether Doe 1 can even do that because -- Oh, Doe 1, everybody agreed, including the Fifth Circuit, that Doe 1 is barred by this new law.
The old law said that you have to have admitting privileges or a written transfer agreement. So it's a little hard to see how this improves anything since you had to have a written transfer agreement anyway; isn't that true or not? Which Doe 1 did not comply with. Well, well -- all right.
But then I don't know why the Fifth Circuit court of appeals, which seemed to have problems with the district court, agreed with the district court as to Doe 1, but that isn't my question. My question is we're not going to solve this at oral argument.
I mean, what I've done, and I'm sure the others have, is I've gone through the district court findings and I have gone through the court of appeals findings, and I have looked at the relevant bits of the record through my office and will do more of that. So I think Doe 2 is your weakest case. I think there are others that are stronger.
But I'd like your opinion, your opinion, about which of these Does is your strongest? And I'll be sure to look very carefully at that. My -- Justice Breyer, I just want to understand your question. You don't understand -- My strongest -- I'm saying which is strongest -- by the strongest, I mean you're trying to make an argument, and you have four Does that you have to deal with.
Okay? So -- And so I want to know, of your opinion, in respect to which Doe is your argument the strongest.
Your argument is that the Fifth Circuit was right to overturn a fact finding and, with Doe 3, a credibility finding of the district court.
That's your argument. Now, you have to support that.
And I want to know in respect to which Doe you feel it's the strongest support for you? And I go in order? Yeah -- Can I give you more than one? -- you can give me all of them if you want, but you don't have that much time. All right.
So -- And if you have a -- if you want to say they're all equally strong, fine.
That's okay, you can say that because I have an opinion about Doe 2, at least, and -- and you can say what you want. Well, I mean -- I think that there's evidence in virtually all of them that they sabotaged their own applications and that Doe 5 was -- and Doe -- Doe 5 obtained privileges in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, asked only one doctor to back him up in Baton Rouge, and all of the doctors agreed that is not difficult to satisfy. Doe 2 simply -- They don't all agree. I mean, that's -- I don't think.
But we're not going to get -- all I want to know is a number. And the reason is we have limited time and I could spend two hours -- Well, I -- -- discussing with you Doe 2, 3, 4.
All I want to know is which should I look at specially hard? I would look at Doe 6 -- All right. -- who applied to one out of nine hospitals in New Orleans. That's what I think. That's a -- that's a good example. All right. That -- that's a great example, because he's the doctor who does only medical abortions, not surgical.
He hadn't done a surgical procedure for over 12 years. And your state's own expert testified that it was not likely that he was going to get privileges anywhere because he only did medical procedures, never saw a patient.
In virtually all of the hospitals, if not all of them, even if there wasn't -- like in Tulane, even if there wasn't a minimum number of patients that had to be admitted before you got privileges, you had to see a certain number of patients in the hospital per year to maintain your privileges. And he couldn't meet that requirement.
So you talk about him applying to only one hospital in a situation where it was guaranteed that he couldn't meet the requirements of any hospital. My understanding of hospital practice today is you got to stay alive only if somebody sees patients -- If -- -- because if they don't see patients, they're of no value to the hospital.
If the patients aren't admitted and there's no circumstance in which this doctor is going to admit a patient because he does no surgical procedures -- Justice Sotomayor, I think the record shows that the -- that they can get privileges, they did get privileges, and there's nothing in the bylaws that prohibits them from being -- Your -- your own expert, Dr. Marier, testified, it is unlikely that a doctor who, like Doe 6 does -- does what Justice Sotomayor said, would ""probably not"" be able to obtain ""active admitting and surgical privileges."" Now, that was your expert.
And the basis of that -- and various other things -- the district court finds that he didn't have to apply to all the hospitals because there was no point because your expert said he probably could not get them.
And it's on the basis of that kind of thing that the district court held that he was likely not to be able to practice. Where does the Fifth Circuit able to say that that was clearly wrong? Justice Breyer, the Fifth Circuit did a searching review of the record just as is -- it is instructed to do by Whole Woman's Health.
And -- and -- in the brief amount of time that I have left, I would like to say just one thing about standing. I think that the record is -- the reason why it demonstrates that these doctors should not be able to challenge a regulation that protects people -- that -- that is intended to protect a class of people from a certain type of activity.
It's health and safety regulations. As a practical matter and -- and even yesterday this Court was talking about the fact that consumers are protected by certain body of laws.
That's what we are doing with health and safety regulations. How does that differ from Craig against Boren? Craig against Boren and -- first of all, had a beer buyer who was a first-party plaintiff in the beginning of the case all the way through until it became -- got -- until it was on appeal.
In addition to that, the state -- Yes, but he didn't count.
The case rode on the owner of the Honk 'n Holler's standing.
Craig turned 21.
He was no longer subject to the law. Which is why I believe it's better characterized as a mootness case, but I would also point out the law at issue -- But the standing -- the Court went on to the merits solely on the basis of the beer seller's standing, and you've got a state regulation that is -- ostensibly was designed to protect these vulnerable boys from drinking beer and getting into accidents. May I? It's a dangerous -- Very -- very, very briefly, counsel. Justice Ginsburg, my -- my answer to that is that the -- the buyer in that case was much more just -- it was much more just a financial transaction.
Their interests were better aligned because he was not prohibited from consuming or possessing the alcohol.
So it -- Thank you. -- really wasn't a health -- Thank you, counsel. General Wall. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' counsel began this morning by saying that this case is about respect for the Court's precedents, but she went on to acknowledge two rather remarkable propositions that flow from the logic of Petitioners' position and that are nowhere to be found in the Court's cases. To you, Justice Alito, that the plaintiffs may bring this suit even if there is a potential or actual conflict of interest with Louisiana women.
And to you, Justice Kavanaugh, that this law would be unconstitutional even if all providers in Louisiana already had admitting privileges or could easily get them. I do think, though, Petitioners did acknowledge what is in the Court's cases, which is, to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, that the burdens may vary by state.
At that point under the substantial obstacle test, we ought to be talking about Does 2, 5, and 6, and how much of a burden there actually was on them, instead of pivoting to the benefits. And to -- to you, Justice Alito, that's not a clear error question.
Nobody disputes what the doctors did.
We're all agreed on the facts.
There's no factual dispute about what the doctors did and didn't do.
It's about how rigorously we -- we're going to -- But what sense -- -- review their fairly modest efforts. What sense does this 30-mile -- that's what I don't understand. I think everybody also agrees that the most likely place the woman will be if she needs to be in a hospital, she'll be at home.
She won't -- and her home has no necessary relationship to 30 miles from a clinic. So two points, Justice Ginsburg.
Again, that's going straight to the benefits and bypassing the burdens, not looking first to whether there's a substantial obstacle. But to go straight to your question, all admitting privileges requirements of which I am aware, and they're fairly uncontroversial in the medical field, have some distance limitation.
And I think the -- the benefits that they go to, the most obvious is the continuity of care, right, because you want the doctor to be able to admit them at some nearby hospital, and at least in some rural areas, there isn't always a hospital right around the road, so whether you draw it 15 or 20 or 30 miles.
And with respect to credentialing, it makes sense to think -- But it just -- -- that the doctors -- -- it just supposed starting out from the clinic where she won't be. She's not going to be at the clinic. Well, that's often true, Justice Ginsburg, but the record here, unlike in Hellerstedt, reveals that sometimes it's not true, that sometimes women develop complications in the clinic and, in fact, Doe 3, who I think on this record is probably the most competent of the Does and is the medical director at Hope, said that he has on occasion had a patient who develops a problem like a perforated uterus and admitted into the hospital and treated it. So even Doe 3 thinks of that as a best medical practice.
Now, granted, we don't know how often it happens and, Justice Kagan, I'm prepared to concede that it may not happen all that often. I don't think anybody knows the real rate.
But the point is that it does happen. And when it does it's very serious. But it would -- And Louisiana -- It would never happen to the -- when you go to the clinic just to take two pills and go home. Well, if you develop a complication at home, it's not -- the -- it's not clear that you won't call the clinic and say to your doctor I'm having a problem, and your doctor will say then go to the following hospital where I have privileges, I'll meet you there. Now, that's not to say as a patient that's necessarily what you would want.
But it's hard for me to believe that women in Louisiana wouldn't at least want the option to be treated by the doctor -- Mr. Wall -- -- they saw at the clinic. -- are you taking the position that there is no woman in Louisiana who doesn't feel burdened by this law? I -- I'm taking the position that -- No, no.
Answer that question. Well -- Is there at least one potential woman you believe that could bring this lawsuit? I assume that there are -- All right.
Now -- -- but they have not sued -- -- stop a moment. Assuming -- we assume, because it's logical, okay, the woman who lives 300 -- there is going to be some woman who lives 330 miles away, who's going to say that's an unusually long period of time for me to have to drive and then drive back the same day.
All right? But putting or -- or the next day. Putting that aside, where is there a conflict between that woman and the doctor? If that woman is going to take the position that this law unduly burdens me, what's the potential conflict? She's going to come in and say you doctors could get credentialing so I really shouldn't sue? You doctors haven't really made an effort so I really shouldn't sue? What sane woman who's a plaintiff is going to have a conflict with a doctor who wants to protect her rights by doing what they can to comply with the law, or not, but their interests are not misaligned, they want to achieve the same holding, that this law unduly burdens her right to abortion. The -- I -- I -- I'm -- I don't see a conflict with that. Well, I would say two things, Justice Sotomayor: Their interests are not necessarily aligned.
One is the interest of for-profit providers and not being regulated in particular ways.
The other is the interest of women in their own health and safety. Now, I don't know how those would have played out if the women had filed suit.
I don't know -- Well, please tell me -- -- how they would have -- -- what you imagine. But to give you a couple of examples -- Okay. -- just to give you -- it's not clear to me that women would have brought facial challenge.
Maybe all of the current providers in Louisiana -- How do you deal with this? I mean, I -- I have read the briefs.
I understand there are good arguments on both sides.
Indeed, in the country people have very strong feelings and a lot of people morally think it's wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong. And in Casey, and the later cases, I think personally the Court is struggling with the problem of what kind of rule of law do you have in a country that contains both sorts of people.
Not -- all right.
So, therefore, I take Casey as given. And I think eight cases where you've given standing, I mean, we could go back and reexamine Marbury versus Madison, but really we have eight cases in the abortion area, we have several cases in other areas, and Whole Woman's Health picks that up.
Casey picks that up.
And you really want us to go back and reexamine this, let's go back and reexamine Marbury versus Madison. And -- and you have good arguments. But why depart from what was pretty clear precedent? I -- I don't want to go back to 1789, Justice Breyer, but I -- I do -- You want to go back for 40 years? Well, I think what we want to say is that in none of those cases has the Court ever considered and -- and signed off in the face of a potential or actual conflict of interest. So, yes, this is an argument that has never been in front of Court and we don't think the Court now faced with it should accept it. And if -- General, I know you have limited time.
And I understand the point that the impact of the -- the law varies from state to state, but why do you look at each state differently if the benefits of the law -- they're not going to change from state-to-state. So I -- I -- I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice.
I think the variance isn't going to be as wide as on the burden side.
But take credentialing, for instance. I think the Petitioners would have to say that if you had a state that really did focus on competence and the hospitals really were vetting for competence -- now, they can dispute whether that happens here -- I mean, that wasn't this case, right? Well, I -- I -- I would say that competence is, I think, a pretty key factor in what the hospitals do.
And if you look at the joint -- On -- on this record? I think if you look at the joint commission standards that are in the record, but my only point to the Chief Justice was that however we -- however we think about that, they can vary depending on how the credentialing system works in a particular state. If I can just make one last point on the merits.
I -- I don't really think it's a clear error standard, Justice Alito.
It's how rigorously are we going to review pretty modest efforts. Doe 2 did not apply to a hospital where he used to have privileges and Doe 3 currently has privileges. Doe 5 got privileges at Touro Hospital in New Orleans and just needed to get a covering doctor in Baton Rouge.
And Doe 6 didn't apply to Touro in New Orleans where Doe 5 has privileges.
So Doe 5 did the thing that Petitioners are here saying can't be done. And it's hard to figure out what the basis for distinction is, because the -- the cites they give in their brief, and it's pretty general and pretty thin, to be honest, but when you really trace it back, it seems to be the hospital bylaws. And Touro, as best we can tell, seems to have bylaws that look like the ones that they say would keep people from getting privileges. The answer -- each of those has an answer.
I mean, they say, look, the ones who didn't get the -- did get the privileges practice in OB-GYN practice, and so they had women who, in fact, were admitted to hospitals.
And the ones who don't are the ones who do medical abortion.
You've heard that. And -- and -- Okay.
And on the other one, as far as, I mean, Doe 2, Doe 2 says I -- I -- I tried to get a covering doctor.
He said no.
The other covering doctors, there's no point because I'm in Baton Rouge -- is that where he was, I think, Doe 2 -- and he said, look, it's a tougher climate here.
Really tough for people who perform abortions.
Quite different from New Orleans. And I was told by one that don't do it because you try to get the covering doctor and that doctor would be subject to picketing, dah-dah-dah.
Okay.
We have all seen that. So we have gone through it.
We'll go through it more.
What do you want to say? So I -- I think Doe 2's in -- in Shreveport.
But far more importantly, what I would say is this: In a pre-enforcement setting, that sort of debate back and forth isn't enough to carry the burden. What ought to have to happen is these physicians ought to have to put their applications where their mouths are and then we'll find out, once they have applied to the full range of hospitals, whether they really can't, whether Doe 2 really can't at Christus, whether Doe 5 really can't find a covering doctor in Baton Rouge, whether Doe 6 really can't at Touro. Can that be done? Is it not -- But on this record I'm very skeptical that they can't. Is it not -- is it not a reality, is it not really the fact, that almost all hospitals in the State of Louisiana do have an admission, you have to have an admission record in order to admit patients? There is something in the record to that effect that you -- you don't get -- if you don't send patients to the hospital, you don't get admission privileges. You may answer. Justice Ginsburg, I think that's difficult to square with the fact that Doe 5, who does not have an OB-GYN practice, got privileges at Touro.
I think Petitioners acknowledge that there are not explicit patient minimums.
They call them implicit. But the kinds of requirements that they are pointing to are the sorts of things that look like they would have precluded Doe 5 and didn't.
These ought to play themselves out in a post-enforcement context, not as here. Thank you, General. Thank you. Five minutes, Ms. Rikelman. Your Honor, the lack of benefits of these laws is not state-dependent. The medical consensus is clear that in no state do they serve health and safety benefits. And, in fact, even the federal government a few months ago removed an admitting privileges requirement from its regulations of surgery centers nationwide, finding that the requirement is medically unnecessary and imposes burdens. And as Justice Kagan asked, this Court rejected an alleged credentialing benefit in Whole Woman's Health.
And after holding a trial, the district court rejected that this law would serve a credentialing benefit in Louisiana. With respect to burdens, the district court found that this law would be extremely burdensome, more so than the Texas law in Whole Woman's Health.
And its finding that these physicians would not be able to get privileges is supported by at least four aspects of the record. The fact that they tried to get privileges at 15 hospitals over one-and-a-half years under the court's supervision; the fact that the state's expert conceded that outpatient physicians who don't have a hospital-based practice are unlikely to get privileges; the fact that abortion access was thrown into chaos when this law actually took effect; and the hospital bylaws themselves, which included a variety of criteria that these physicians could never meet, including residency requirements. And, finally, I'd like to point out that this is not, in fact, a pre-enforcement challenge.
The state has recognized that, including in its state papers before this Court. The district court allowed the law to take effect but enjoined its penalties and supervised the physicians' efforts to get privileges over a year and a half.
Again, the state has previously acknowledged that this is not a pre-enforcement challenge. If there are no further questions. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this term in Case Number 18-6135, Kahler versus Kansas. Ms. Schrup. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For centuries, criminal culpability has hinged on the capacity for moral judgment, to discern and to choose between right and wrong.
The insane lack that capacity. This understanding of insanity has persisted since the 1500s and remains the rule in 48 jurisdictions today.
But Kansas scrubs moral capacity from its criminal law and runs afoul of the Fourteenth and the Eighth Amendments. Kansas rewrites history in two ways, first by elevating the wild beast test, one that was never used in this country and only rarely in England, and secondly by conflating common law intent, which required a vicious will and was bound up in moral capacity, with the -- what it applies today, a morality-free modern mens rea. As such, Kansas uproots the deeply rooted by eliminating any mechanism to assess whether a defendant's capacity for moral judgment was intact or was irretrievably compromised by mental illness. Now, I'd like to turn briefly to due process first and explain why the moral capacity notion is and always has been fundamental in our system. The model penal code is an excellent exam -- example.
As criminal law evolved, the drafters moved to more precise mental states. When they did that, though, they retained the compelling mechanism to show insanity.
We could do that, the drafters said, because we kept this, this narrow remnant of common law criminality. In Clark, too, this Court recognized both the presumption of sanity and that evidence of insanity trumps mens rea.
This demonstrates the continued need for a mechanism to rebut the presumption of sanity, even when -- even though a defendant harbors the requisite mental state. And it was not only the mechanism that was important in Clark; the substance was too.
This Court said Arizona could do that, it could eliminate the first part of the M'Naghten test, because it kept this, the right and wrong principle that subsumes it. So I'd like to now turn back to history because it can be -- Well, before you do that, you're relying on due process.
And suppose a state decides it wants to rethink the insanity defense.
It looks to other nations for models.
And one is what's known as a -- as a judgment of guilty but insane; that is, two determinants are made.
Did the defendant do the act with which he is charged? That's the first question.
And the second question is, what is the proper incapacitation? So guilty but insane would lead to incapacitation in a mental institution.
Guilty and not insane would lead to incarceration in prison. Would such a scheme, if adopted by a state of the United States, violate due process? Yes, it would, Justice Ginsburg.
And I think it would because the conviction itself carries collateral consequences that -- and we have never, as a country, treated the insane as culpable.
And that conviction would -- would impose collateral consequences on the insane person who really should be excused. But I -- I would have thought you would want collateral consequences imposed, as I understood your submission, because the idea is that someone acquitted by reason of insanity would not go free but would instead be committed to mental care. Yes, that's right, Your Honor.
But -- Well, why wouldn't that -- if that's the consequence of the system Justice Ginsburg was talking about, guilty but insane, I don't understand why that's not exactly the sort of course you're looking for. Well, I want to rewind a little bit, Your Honor, because really what we're talking about is the mechanism to be able to show that you lack moral capacity.
The back end of it, as long as you have the mechanism to show that you lack moral capacity, that you can choose right from wrong or can't do that, then the ultimate result is not all that determinative.
If guilty but insane means that you -- if -- if you end up in exactly the same place, then I suppose the label doesn't matter, but what I'm nervous about, actually, is if you have a guilty but insane, some of those statutes in some jurisdictions are you're guilty, you go and get treatment, and then once you are -- My -- -- well -- My hypothetical is the question of where the person is incarcerated is determined second.
It has no collateral consequences.
You're found to have committed the conduct charged, but because you are insane, you go to a mental institution.
So it would take out any collateral consequences that would label you on the criminal side.
It's just you -- you have committed the deed that you were charged with, but you were insane; therefore, you go to mental institution.
That, you think, would violate due process? Well, Your Honor, I -- you know, to the extent -- so I guess I would go back to history on this.
And what we know is that these people were not even subject to prosecution at all.
Hawkins, in his Plea of the Crown, said so.
But as long as -- the mechanism -- as long as the mechanism for the defendant to present his lack of moral capability at the back end, if the regime protects him in that way. But I also disagree, Your Honor, that the conviction doesn't stigmatize or show that he is guilty.
I mean, if you're found guilty, you have that conviction.
I do think that the insane need mental treatment.
They need commitment. So I guess I'm not -- unless I'm missing your point, I believe it's more about the mechanism and not allowing a conviction of an insane person. You're talking about lack of moral capacity.
Would it be unconstitutional if a state said that a person is sane if the person knows that the act is illegal, even if the person thinks that the act is moral? So the right-and-wrong principle, Your Honor, includes both knowledge of legal wrong and knowledge of moral wrong. There's very little light between the two. So -- Well, I don't know that that's the case.
Someone can know that something is illegal but feel very strongly that it is moral.
So what -- what's the answer to my question? Justice Alito, it's not about a belief.
It's about a capacity fueled by mental illness.
So if a person justifies or believes that they are justified in acting in that way, they are not covered by this baseline standard. If the -- What's the answer -- -- person -- I -- I -- if -- if the person has the capacity to know that what he did was a violation of the criminal law, and that's the defense that is provided by a state, is that unconstitutional? No.
So long as it encompasses -- it can't just be that you are -- that you -- you forget what criminal law is. What Justice Breyer said in the dissent from the denial of cert in Delling was that what legally wrong means -- and it still falls within the right-and-wrong principle, what legally wrong means is that you are unable to comprehend the actual nature of -- of the act such that you believe, for example, that you're falling into a defense. Well, there are many, many people who believe, maybe not so much for murder, but certainly for a lot of other offenses, that things that are violations of the law are nevertheless moral. And so if that were the general rule in criminal law, that you cannot be convicted if you -- if you know that -- if you believe that what you've done is moral, that would revolutionize criminal law.
And the only element that you are adding to that is that this is caused by a mental disorder. So it becomes important to understand what you mean by mental disorder.
And what do you mean by a mental disorder? Do you mean everything that is listed as a mental disorder in the latest edition of the DSM? Your Honor, it's not about the diagnosis.
And you asked what mental capacity means and -- and what mental illness means.
I can put it this way: It is as if a person -- it's -- again, it's not about a belief.
It's not about justifying.
It's about you actually can't tap in to the part of your brain that allows you to choose right versus wrong. And juries have, in 48 jurisdictions, been able to make this distinction regardless of what the diagnosis is. Well, what is the answer to my question? Is it sufficient if the person has something that is considered to be a mental disorder in the DSM? And it has been calculated that one in five people in the United States has some mental disorder.
So we're talking about 60 plus -- 60 million plus people. All of them could go to the jury on the question of whether they had the capacity to know that what they were doing when they committed the crime was morally wrong. Justice Alito, they should be given the opportunity to at least try. This shouldn't be legislatively cut off at the knees.
There are many mechanisms in place in our trial system, many hoops that they would have to jump through. But if they have a mental disease that's diagnosed, then they should at least be able to get in the door and get evaluated and then proceed -- Ms. -- -- and -- Ms. Schrup -- Yes? Can I ask you about a premise of your argument? And it's that if we look to history, and if history supports what you say, then we're obligated to go with it now. And I -- I just want to ask how and why that's so, because there are many ways in which understandings of criminal culpability change over the years.
And -- and -- and how do we figure out which are the ones that the Constitution requires stay the same now as they were back in the common law or back at the founding or back in 1868, depending on which date you're using, and -- and -- and which ones can change? What -- what -- what do we do? We're not stuck with all of history, are we? So if we're -- if we're not stuck with all of history, why are we obligated to keep this part of it? Well, Your Honor, because that's the test that this Court has set out for due process.
And you could go back as far as you want, but by the 1500s, we know that this was an intact principle. Well, the -- I mean, the test that was set out by this Court for due process, I mean, I could give you some ways in which the criminal law of olden times seems remarkably archaic to us now, marital rape exception, maybe sodomy laws.
I'm sure that there are others that I could list. You know, what does due process require we hang onto notwithstanding changing times? And -- and I guess what is criminal -- not -- what -- what is -- what does the Due Process Clause require that we hang onto, notwithstanding the judgments of some states that the time for this has come and gone? Well, we are -- we actually have sort of a perfect complements, Justice Kagan, because we have not only the history that goes back maybe a thousand years, and certainly since the mid 1500s, but we also have the modern practice, a fundamental -- a rule of fundamental fairness currently in operation in 48 of 53 U.S. jurisdictions. So it's not just the history.
It's the fact that we look and everyone has retained it or nearly everyone has retained it. With respect to history, can we take into account the reality, that in the old days at common law, the result of the insanity defense would be you were sent to bedlam, where the conditions were often far worse than in prison? So someone might decide, no, I'm not going to plead insanity, because then I'll end up with an incarceration worse than prison. Do we take that into account in deciding the function of the insanity defense? I don't think you need to take it into account.
I think what the fundamental principle is, is that the good and evil principle or the right and wrong principle as applied to the insane, it's -- it's the application to the insane that has -- is deeply rooted in our country. And where those people -- I mean, in today's time, those people wouldn't be sent there, right? We know after Foucha that this -- those people are sent to an institution. So, no, I don't think it's -- it's how they were historically -- where they ended up. They ended up in a lot of places, Justice Ginsburg.
Sometimes they ended up there. Sometimes they were released to their families. So -- The things that I -- I think is underlying a lot of the debate is the expansive notion of what counts as evidence.
In -- in -- in your brief, you say the defendant in this case was -- this is evidence to support his insanity claim, was described by some as a tightwad who would, for example, borrow rather than purchase tools. And -- and in the same page, again, this is evidence that you selected in the -- to put in your brief of his mental disorder, that he thrived on self-importance, community prestige, and being perceived as having an ideal or perfect marriage. Now, maybe that's not the best way to order your life, but if that's what you mean by insanity, you can understand why that might cause some reservations. Your Honor, Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, let me just tell you why those facts are in there and why they're not -- why they're there and that will shed light on it. What we know is that Mr. Kahler had a major depressive disorder.
He had a qualifying mental illness.
Those facts are in there to show that there was an entire other category of evidence that, in combination with that major depressive disorder, could have been developed. But that he -- But it doesn't -- -- borrows tools instead of purchasing them? That sounds like the reasonable option. (Laughter.) Well, you can't -- Mr. Chief Justice, you can't take that one fact out of context.
But the most important thing is, is that juries are able to take the collection of evidence and -- that is presented to them, and decide, they decide whether the person is insane, whether they have the capacity for moral judgment or not. But what would be put before the jury, that is, what now, what evidence in this record would you point to to show that Kahler was unable to tell right from wrong? What evidence is there that he was unable to make that distinction? On the current record -- which, of course, was not developed with a right and wrong principle -- I would point you to the Joint Appendix at 87 where his expert said that he -- he couldn't rule out short-term disassociation.
If you are off-line in that way, he couldn't appreciate right versus wrong. But, again, I'd like to point out that he was -- he was not even given the opportunity to put forth that and to develop other evidence that would have shown more forcefully that he didn't. And that's -- Well, he had the -- -- the same for every defendant. He had the opportunity and every incentive to do that at the penalty phase.
At the penalty phase, he was able to -- to argue I shouldn't get a death sentence because I didn't know that what I was doing was morally wrong. And you'd think that, if the jury believed that, they wouldn't have imposed the death penalty. But they did.
And you have to keep in mind what he did.
And this is an intelligent man, and he sneaked up on the house, where his wife and her mother and his children were staying.
He killed his ex-wife.
He killed his ex -- her mother.
He executed his two teenage daughters.
One of them is heard on the tape crying.
He, nevertheless, shot her to death. He spared the son, because he didn't think the son was siding with the mother.
And then he ran away and turned himself in the next day. Now, this is the stuff from which you're going to make a defense he didn't know that what he was doing was morally wrong, much less he didn't know what he was doing was legally wrong? Justice Alito, I'll answer the first part.
Sentencing is not a substitute because we know from the briefs that jurors make up their mind at the guilt phase. And, in fact, a dissenting Justice in the opinion below said we should not let what happens at guilt indicate what happens at sentencing. And because that he lacked that, the jury lacked that lens to consider the moral capacity principle, you can't draw any -- it would be speculative to say what the capital jury would have decided. But is that realistic? I'm on a jury and I say: Well, now I -- I've convicted this guy.
I found him guilty.
Having done that, even though I think that he didn't know that what he was doing was morally wrong, I'm going to vote to impose the death penalty. Is that realistic? It is realistic because we know from the briefs that they -- that jurors are swayed by what they decide at the guilt phase.
And if they have lacked the mechanism and the opportunity to look through the lens of capacity for moral judgment, then -- then we can't draw any conclusions about that. Now, the facts are hard in every case and they are hard in this case.
But what we're talking about is an opportunity, a mechanism for all defendants, to be able to get into the threshold and let a jury decide -- You've referred several times to the jury.
And one of the debates that has occurred over the last several decades is the capacity of juries to be able to parse these fine concepts.
And one of the things that leading scholars have said is that this may be beyond the capacity of jurors to do in a principled way. So why can't a state say, as Justice Alito points out, we're going to take this away from the jury as a separate defense, put it into mens rea, and then, as Justice Ginsburg points out, have it considered at sentencing? Why is that an unreasonable policy judgment, so unreasonable as to violate due process? Well, two points, Justice Kavanaugh.
First of all, the critiques or the debates were not about abolition.
They were not about scrapping the defense entirely.
Those should be handled through instructional or -- Well -- -- evidentiary mechanisms. Sorry to interrupt, but I think one of the debates was, in fact, about putting it into a mens rea defense as Kansas has done, in part because the concept as a separate defense was too confusing for jurors.
And Professor Goldstein pointed that out in his book and that has been part of the debate. So they haven't necessarily abolished the insanity defense.
I think that's a bit of a misnomer.
They have funneled it into mens rea and then said that it can be considered at sentencing as well. Justice Kavanaugh, they have abolished.
I mean, they -- they've acknowledged they've abolished.
And what is present in the mens rea approach is nothing more than what Winship requires.
And we know that it is not sufficient because it doesn't allow -- it doesn't allow a jury or -- or the defendant to raise his capacity for moral judgment, which, if you go back through history, was an important component -- Ms. -- -- of criminal culpability. Ms. Schrup, do you have any information about how this works in the 46 states that have the rule that you prefer? In other words, how often do people raise insanity defenses? How often do juries actually find insanity? If this were in one of the other 46 states, how would it operate? But -- or -- or not if this case was.
I mean, honestly, you can't say this, but I can.
This -- in none of these 46 states, I'm -- I'm -- I'm guessing, would your client be found insane.
But what happens in these 46 states? How often are people found insane? So, Justice Kagan, it's not in the record.
I have done some research. I could let you know what I found out if you'd like me to, but it's not contained in the record.
But I do know that it is raised in the right-and-wrong states and that there are acquittals every year. And, counsel, can I just -- one other question about the extent of how far this goes.
Obviously, this is a capital case, but how -- how far down the road would you say this defense must be extended as a matter of due process? To all homicides? To all felonies? Where do you think the line would be drawn? I don't think that you draw the line, Justice Gorsuch, at punishment. So an insanity defense is required with respect to any criminal complaint, even a regulatory strict liability misdemeanor? This Court has never -- well, so it's our position -- we're making a facial challenge, so it's our position it should be applied everywhere. Okay. But this Court has never definitively ruled on the extent of strict liability crimes.
I think it could carve that out.
But I think what's important are two things, Justice Gorsuch: First of all, this is a rarely used defense.
It's invoked in less than one percent of the cases and successful in only a quarter of that.
We're not talking about a huge number of people. But for the people that it really matters, there is no mechanism in these states to protect them, to let them be excused or to let the -- a jury consider their actual culpability when they can't tap into their brains in the way other people's -- people can. And I think jurors are able to decide that. They decide the term ""reasonableness"" all the time. If a state adopted the irresistible impulse defense, would that be unconstitutional? This Court in Leland said that it is not a constitutional floor.
So, no. No, not whether it's required, but would that be unconstitutional because it does not ask whether the person knew right from wrong? I think, yes, it would -- it would also have to include the right-and-wrong principle. I'd like to turn briefly to the Eighth Amendment.
The original public meaning of that term was that it would be cruel and unusual to punish the insane.
In 1868, with the Reconstruction, amendments were adopted.
Every single jurisdiction had an insanity defense. And even if you rewind back to 1791, it would have been cruel and unusual to punish the insane.
They were either handled outside of the legal process or they were allowed to come in and plead and prove insanity. Because the Eighth Amendment was -- was intended as a check on sovereign power, states are simply not free to legislatively redefine culpability in a way that is inconsistent with history and long-standing practice. But that is what Kansas has done here. It is an outlier.
It prevents people from -- it -- well, by taking away the mechanism, they ensure that insane people will be punished in their borders. The Kansas Supreme Court didn't reach that question, so you are asking to -- us to decide it as a matter of first impression. No, Justice Ginsburg. And this -- you know, was vetted at the cert stage, and I would point this Court to the addendum to -- at our cert reply at page 18 and 19, because there it's clear that this notion of applying wrongfulness to the insanity defense came up at oral argument, was argued, and in that post-argument memo, counsel said we believe that this issue is presented.
We're going to -- if you want supplemental briefing, we'll provide it, but we believe it is an issue that is implicit in this Court's ruling. What do you do with the statement of Justice Marshall for a plurality in Powell versus Texas? ""Nothing could be less fruitful than for this Court to be impelled into defining some sort of insanity defense -- or insanity test in constitutional terms."" I think pointing out the difficulty of us, through the Due Process Clause, wading into this policy debate and figuring out what the line is. Justice Kavanaugh, that -- and Powell was not an abolition case, first of all.
But, secondly, what Justice Powell said there was a reflection of the facts of that case.
That case had to grapple with Leland, and the only mechanism or the only test that would have applied in Powell is an irresistible or compulsion-based test. So our standard, the right-and-wrong standard, is below that.
And it's not a -- But -- but Leland in turn said -- noted the wide disagreement among different tests and said choice of a test involves not only scientific knowledge but questions of basic policy.
The whole problem has evoked wide disagreement among those who have studied it, which is true as to this -- as to the Kansas approach as well.
There's wide disagreement, but some have advocated for that as well. Well, Leland also recognized the right-and-wrong principle was the majority test in the majority of jurisdictions. And that holds true today because 48 jurisdictions have retained this baseline principle.
And we're not -- Are -- are all 48 constitutional? If they have the right-and-wrong principle, they are.
Yes. Is that a yes? Yes, I'm sorry. All 48 are constitutional? Yes. Justice Marshall's -- Justice Marshall's statement in Powell was not limited in the way that you suggest.
It was categorical.
And he was joined by Chief Justice Warren, Justice Black, and Justice Harlan in saying that.
So they were all wrong at that time? Mr. Chief Justice? Briefly. Okay.
Justice Alito, it's not that they were wrong; it's just they were talking about a different scenario, a non-abolition case dealing with a test that is north of our standard.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Crouse. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner asked this Court to define a rule of insanity and to require the states to implement that rule in its criminal justice proceedings.
But, as this Court indicated in Powell, nearly 50 years ago, nothing would be less fruitful than for this Court to select a rigid rule of constitutional law of insanity. And that admonition rings as true today as it did 50 years ago. The first thing I'd like to talk about is that it's not deeply rooted.
The right versus wrong test is a relatively recent vintage.
The historical basis for it started somewhere around the 1800s; and, therefore, it's not deeply rooted. In addition, the states have had historical and traditional discretion to both define the elements of the criminal law, the defenses that are available in those criminal justice proceedings, and the substantive rules at which those defenses and elements are met. And consistent with that discretion, the State of Kansas has a holistic approach to the mental illness problem starting at the time the criminal justice proceeding is initiated, throughout the guilt phase, as well as in the punishment phase, and continuing on even with regard to the sentence as it's carried out, whether being in a prison or in a mental hospital. These factors confirm that Petitioner has not carried the heavy burden to identify a single rule that is clearly established and required by the fundamental elements of due process.
And for that reason, we believe that the state supreme court judgment in Kansas should be affirmed. And so unless there are additional questions this Court would have, I'd -- I'd like to first turn to the answer of Justice Alito's question, and the answer is the right-and-wrong test has multiple components.
There is no consistent element or definition of how that's applied in any of the 46 jurisdictions.
As our brief points out, there are a host of different factions and different ways in which those elements would be met, and we think that, in and of itself, undermines the constitutional floor that Petitioner seeks -- Mr. Crouse -- -- to have us -- I -- I understand what you're saying, but I have a problem because, as I understand the mens rea test, it takes away excusing a person who, from the 15 -- 1400s, would have been considered a lunatic, a person who hears voices and the voices tell him or her what to do, and they have no volition to fight back. They -- many of them know they're killing somebody.
So intent under your mens rea test is met.
They absolutely know they're killing someone; they just have no ability to say no.
They -- they don't -- they can't because of their either mental illness -- lunacy, all of the wild beast things, all of -- yes, they have two components, some volition and some not, but for centuries, that concept of no volition, the true lunatic, would get off. Your test doesn't do that. Well, it -- it does.
So our test is -- is relatively consistent with the cognitive capacity test.
There's a volitional, there's a moral test, and then there's the product test.
And so we -- we would view our test as consistent with the cognitive test. And if the individual can't formulate the in -- criminal intent in Kansas, that -- that is a sufficient defense.
And that has been -- But that's not how I read your charge.
I mean, when I read the charge here, it doesn't talk -- you're talking the very language that your adversary is suggesting you should adopt. No. But it's not part of the mens rea test.
The strict mens rea test now is do you intend to -- do you know what you're doing? Do you have criminal intent, that's right.
I -- I -- No, no -- What I -- -- there's not -- yes, you're -- you're adding a volition.
But what I'm saying is your -- this test standing alone doesn't do that. So, as I -- I understand Petitioner's test, is they want to ask the question of whether or not the individual knows that it's either legally or morally right versus wrong.
What Kansas does is, if you have criminal intent, you are responsible. But -- Well, I think there -- -- after conviction then you have the opportunity to assert a right versus wrong test. Well, but that's the point, which is that issue, which is after conviction.
What she's been arguing is that since the beginning of time, both under English law and at the time of the founding, all the states then -- and, frankly, until I think the 1970s -- all 50 states didn't make it a subject of sentencing. They made it a reason for why you should be excused from your conduct -- for your conduct. You're saying the same thing with something like duress: I intend to kill someone, but it's because somebody is holding a gun to my head.
All 50 states would let you off.
But you're now saying it's okay to stigmatize you with a criminal conviction even though, in fact, you may be insane. I'm saying what the state of Kansas has done is it has defined its mental illness defense consistent with what the historical teachings are, dating back to Blackstone, going all the way up to the 1910, I believe it was Professor -- Dean Orville Morris indicated that up until the 19th Century, that being M'Naghten, criminal intent was what handled everything with regard to criminal insanity. So, General Crouse, could you assume for a moment that I disagree with you on the reading of the historical record? And just let's say that the historical record actually -- that there's much more evidence than you are suggesting that a defendant had to have a guilty mind, meaning an understanding that what he was doing was immoral, as well as the inability to form specific criminal intent. And if -- if that's the case, if you look at the -- all the cases and say, you know, case after case after case what they're talking about is something more than criminal intent, what they're talking about is some kind of moral understanding, if that's the case what's your best argument that you should win? So I think I have three. The first one is the existence of strict liability.
The second would be the existence of corporate liability.
And, third, I think there's just the general understanding that criminal intent has always been separated from moral and -- moral capacity. And even with regard to -- I think the hypothetical you have suggested, I think we would have to know whether or not the right versus wrong test is being defined in a legal sense or a moral sense. And even if so, the states that have adopted the right versus wrong test have variations within them.
Some, for example, like the federal government, to my understanding, would require a severe mental illness. You know, I guess I -- I understand that there are some variations in the historical record and even in states now, but -- but there are some number of states, a great number, 46 states, 48 states, whatever it is, that go further than you do in terms of saying something more is -- is required than the mere capacity to -- to formulate criminal intent, and that that something more in large measure is some ability to -- to -- to make moral judgments and to distinguish between right and wrong. And, again, let's just assume that -- that that's what the historical record said.
I know you don't agree with that.
But let's assume that that's what the historical record indicated.
Could you still win and why? I -- I could because of the nature of this Court's inquiry.
This Court has to -- I'm sorry, Petitioner has to satisfy a high burden to identify a particular rule that the absence of which Kansas law would constitute a violation of a deeply-rooted rule.
And that simply doesn't exist based upon the very generalities that we've talked about today.
So -- But it seems that by its nature, if the principle is, as Justice Kagan suggests, hypothetically, if it's historically established that you cannot punish people who don't know the difference between right and wrong, that certainly sounds like something that is rooted in the conscience and would be ranked as fundamental. Well, I -- I think what the -- what the -- and I don't mean to fight the hypothetical here -- but my understanding of the history is that what has been dealt with throughout our time is how to resolve and handle mental illness within the criminal capability system. And what this Court's decision, Arizona versus Clark said, is that there is no fundamental -- You're not going to get it exactly.
I mean, it is a -- it is a nightmare trying to figure out exact standards. I agree with that.
But my question, which I just hope you would clarify, because it's -- I'm stumbling on it, imagine two defendants. Both defendants, 1 and 2, are certified by whatever board of psychiatrists you want as totally insane.
All right? The first defendant shoots and kills Smith.
The second defendant shoots and kills Jones. The first defendant thinks that Smith is a dog.
The second defendant knows it's a person but thinks the dog told him to do it. Okay? What's the difference? So I think that's -- the difference is criminal intent in the first situation because, as I understand the hypothetical, the individual intends to commit a crime against a human being. I -- I -- I know these are words, you see, I want it looking for something in terms of criminal law or legal purpose or human purpose or whatever that would treat the two -- why treat them differently? One answer you've given, you said it's so hard to figure out.
I agree it's hard to get a definition.
That's going to be true in both cases. You say criminal, corporate criminal liability, and regulatory offenses.
I agree with you, you'd have to carve out exceptions and that is not easy to do.
Okay? I've got those points. But I'm looking for something different between the two defendants.
The dog, there he is, the dog, he told me to do it.
They are both crazy. And why does Kansas say one is guilty, the other is not guilty? So I -- I think that this Court's cases have historically allowed legislative -- I don't care -- -- bodies -- -- what the cases say at this moment.
I've read cases, my law clerk has found 40 instances, going back to Bracton, you know, where it seems to be against you, but I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in a practical, pragmatic purpose, in why the law should treat those two cases differently.
Same question, I've just now repeated it three times, and I am listening for your answer. So -- and I apologize for not getting to the answer of your question.
I think that the problem is that states have grappled with this and they've made different moral judgments as to who is morally responsible or not.
And this Court's cases allow the state legislatures or federal Congress to determine whether that person should be or should not be held responsible. What Kansas does is it identifies those who intend to commit a crime, punishes those. You're -- you're telling me -- Our -- our -- convicts them -- -- that states -- and you're right, particularly Kansas, do, in fact, treat he's a dog, the dog told me to do it, differently.
But my question was why? Well, I think it's a spectrum as to what the states believe is appropriate. In Delaware, for example, my understanding is that individual would not be convicted, whereas in Illinois that person could be convicted because they know that shooting a human being is legally wrong. Do you think, General Crouse, that you could also eliminate consideration of the moral understanding at sentencing, in other words, take the Justice Breyer example and the dog told me to do it, would it be unconstitutional if your state did not have a procedure for considering that at sentencing? So obviously a different question and I think it also engenders a different test.
I think that -- that, if you're considering what is available at the sentencing, for whether it violates the constitution, would implicate the Eighth Amendment. Well, let's put the Eighth Amendment to the side.
Let's say that this isn't a capital case.
All right? Does a state just have to have a way to consider at sentencing somebody's complete lack of understanding of the morality of his actions? I don't believe that this Court's cases would indicate that the states have to consider the morality at sentencing or any particular time. But the -- How about -- how about the mens rea aspect of that? I -- I -- I just want to follow up on Justice Breyer's question as well, and Justice Kagan.
If -- would you -- would you accept that at least that is required as a matter of due process, that some inquiry into mens rea is required in these cases? And if so, why? And if not, why? Well, yes, I would accept that carving out strict liability in the corporate liability context. Why? And how do you reconcile that with our strict liability cases? Well, I -- I think what this Court has done is historically guarded mens rea because that's what separates innocent conduct from criminal conduct.
And that's what Kansas has done here. So you -- you accept that there is a constitutional minimum floor below which the state -- states cannot proceed with respect to mental capacity and insanity; you just suggest that you've met that standard. I -- Is that the -- the nub of the argument, then? I think I would finely parse that a little bit.
I would -- I admit that there is a mens rea requirement with regard to how one would define insanity.
I don't believe that this Court has identified a floor and suggested that there are variations of ways to handle -- I'm not sure I understand.
You accept that states can define strict liability crimes.
I don't know if you've answered Justice Gorsuch's -- No. -- question which is could -- could you do away with the mens rea defense? Could you simply say we in Kansas believe if you kill someone, regardless of the reasons, if you've done the act, you've committed murder? Period, end of story.
No mens rea defense, no nothing. Again, I think that is a much more difficult situation, and I -- I -- I think that would present a -- a lot of additional problems for the State of Kansas because of this Court's requirement of having a mens rea baseline. Could you -- Well, has that -- -- get rid of other defenses -- -- ever been -- has that -- -- General Crouse? Could you get rid of other defenses? You know, duress.
Could you get rid of the duress defense? Yeah, so -- so I -- I think the same historical analysis that we have undergone with regard to the insanity test is something that we would have to look at.
I haven't done the -- Well, on the -- -- individual research on duress -- -- the history -- You seem very reticent about answering these questions.
Has there ever been -- can you cite any -- any state or any legal system, I'll even just limit it to English-speaking countries, that have ever said that killing another person is a strict liability offense? No.
And -- and Kansas certainly doesn't do that. On the history that Justice Kagan was asking about, I think your primary answer was that there's been no particular test that is historically rooted. But isn't there a baseline that is historically rooted, above which there have been a variety of tests that have been accepted by the states until, as Justice Sotomayor said, until the end of the 20th century? I -- I think I would agree that the states have -- organized societies have consistently struggled with how to define and handle mental illness, but I don't believe that there has been a baseline that has been established beneath which the states could go. Well, since the early 1800s, at least, to the late 20th century in the United States, didn't every state allow some form of a separate insanity defense at the guilt phase? My understanding is that the treatment of insanity has varied within particular parameters.
For example, some states would require an affirmative defense.
Kansas, for example, didn't have a separate defense. It -- But all separate -- let me just focus on my question. All -- all the states had something separate from the mens rea approach at the guilt phase through the end of the 20th century; isn't that correct as a matter of historical practice? You can still win the case, as Justice Kagan noted, but just to make sure we're on the same page. Yeah, and I'm not trying to -- to skip the answer, because I think Kansas actually included it as part of the guilt phase. It didn't have a separate insanity defense. So, for example, it came in with a different definition. I mean, you're saying all states had a separate insanity defense in 1791? I -- I -- I don't believe I was saying that -- No. -- they have separate defenses.
I think they handled it differently. Some of them defined it as an affirmative defense.
Some of them put it in a separate proceeding. Some of them handled it through mens rea, did they not? They have. Does mens rea for murder or for any other criminal defense vary from case to case? Is it not the same in every case regardless of whether the person claims to be mentally ill or not? The mens rea element would be consistent in an attempt to commit a crime, yes. So if the mens rea element traditionally incorporated a requirement of moral capability -- of moral culpability, that would apply across the board, would it not? Not just to cases where the person says this is -- I -- I had this lack of capacity due to mental illness, but I have it due to political brainwashing or religious fanaticism or any other reason? That's correct, Justice Alito. I mean, is that -- was was that the traditional understanding of mens rea? So I don't believe that was consistent with the historical understanding of mens rea.
And I think it's also inconsistent with general criminal principles in which we don't look at the motive of the individual committing the crime -- Would -- would you agree that historically, if you go back and you look at the cases, you see this operating in two categories of cases.
One is for insane people, and one is for what were then called idiots, right, people who lacked mental capacity? So, I mean, but -- but for those people, it came up again and again that, yes, you know, you lack the moral capacity to understand what you're doing and, therefore, the criminal system ought to operate differently on you.
Isn't -- isn't that right? So I -- I would push back only in -- in regard to whether or not it was a moral capability.
I think, historically, it's looked at a cognitive capability as to whether we could -- can take intent to commit a crime. And I don't think that the moral capacity came in until the M'Naghten era as to -- we asked whether or not someone knew it was right and wrong to commit a crime. But it wasn't phrased at that.
I mean, it's quite deep, this question.
It's like ethics and Aristotle.
The wind blew my hand.
You don't hold him -- well, I'll save my depth for later. Finish your question. I'm not sure I want to. (Laughter.) Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Ms. Prelogar. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner bears the burden of establishing that substantive due process principles override the Kansas legislature's judgment in this case in adopting a mens rea test of insanity, and he has not carried that burden. Petitioner suggests that this Court should recognize a theory of moral culpability and impose that uniformly across the states. But the problem with that approach is, both as a matter of history and in contemporary practice, there has been no agreement on the precise circumstances when mental illness should excuse criminal responsibility. And I'd like to begin, actually, with the hypotheticals that Justice Sotomayor and Justice Breyer brought up, because I think that this actually illustrates that even in contemporary jurisdictions today, there is a basic divide on when someone should be entitled to invoke the insanity defense.
And this gets to the -- the difference between legal wrong and moral wrong. Even in those jurisdictions that adopt a wrongfulness test, the one that Petitioner is proposing, there is differential treatment of defendants based on whether they could appreciate that their conduct violated the law and constituted a crime or not. So imagine the defendant who hears voices that command him to kill in order to save the human race.
He knows that murder is a crime and that he'd be violating the law, but he thinks the action is morally justified because of his mental illness. In a substantial number of jurisdictions, he would not be entitled to invoke the insanity defense.
And so to try to recognize or articulate a theory of moral culpability, I think, has -- has no roots in history and would actually raise the possibility of challenging state laws across the nation. Excuse me.
We have -- every state has a duress defense.
They all vary.
They all have different exceptions. They all have different articulations.
There's never been a common one, but all 50 have them. And the essence of it is defined very simply as duress, compulsion.
And we give wide, wide, incredible latitude to the states to define those circumstances. I think what your adversary is saying is that making this go simply to intent and taking out some differentiation from the true lunatic who knows it's wrong to kill a person but the TV made him do it, no volition whatsoever to conform his conduct to the law, no ability, I think it's more moral incapacity, rather than capacity.
The intent-based defenses don't encompass that in any way. This is not like Clark where we found that the two prongs of the M'Naghten test were really encompassed in the first.
That's what the problem is for me.
There is an essence, just as there is an essence of compulsion for duress as a -- as a defense mechanism, there is some minor amount that has to excuse criminal liability. And, Justice Sotomayor, Kansas here has recognized cognitive incapacity as the way that you excuse criminal responsibility when you're assessing these difficult issues of how mental illness should function to excuse criminal culpability in a criminal justice system. But that's -- I think that -- -- where we differ. But to the extent that you are -- Because you could know something is against the law and still not have the ability to conform your conduct.
If I make a moral choice I could say, if it's only a moral choice, I could say I don't wish to do it because of my morality.
Could I physically stop myself? Yes. Someone who is insane can't even physically stop themselves. And our -- But that's a different, sort of -- I absolutely agree it's a different test of insanity.
As this Court has recognized, jurisdictions have struggled with this across time and across different places and they've settled on different variants in trying to identify the precise circumstances -- But, Ms. -- Which would pull someone totally outside the realm of -- Ms. Prelogar -- -- criminal culpability. -- what you are suggesting as a test for insanity is not a test for insanity.
It's just the usual intent requirement that we apply to all defendants. If the defendant doesn't have the intent to kill, then the defendant is not culpable for that act.
And it has nothing to do with his insanity or not.
And I think that the question Ms. -- Justice Sotomayor is asking is, is there something else that's necessary? And we would leave a lot of flexibility to the states, but that something else is -- is something that relates -- relates particularly to insane defendants, to, you know, their ability to say, because I have a mental illness, there has to be something more. So I don't think that there is something else here.
And as this Court has recognized, the guidepost is history.
What Petitioner needs to do is come forward with some kind of historical consensus establishing that there's a fundamental principle that Kansas's mens rea approach is violating. And actually the mens rea approach is itself one that was linked to the common law early articulations of insanity.
It was long understood that one of the ways you might try to identify that class of individuals who should be declared legally insane as a legal concept was to look at those who didn't have capacity to form criminal intent. And I -- I want to pause -- So -- -- for a moment -- Ms. Prelogar, let's just say I disagree with this, that -- that when I look back at the history I see lots of cases, Rex v. Arnold, Billingham, a number of others, which make it quite clear, I mean, these are all people who had an intent to kill. And what the common law was saying was that even though they had the intent to kill, there was going to be a further inquiry into how their insanity limited their moral understanding, that -- their understanding of wrongfulness of their act.
So if I think that that's kind of all over the history, how do I find for you? Well, I want to make clear that even if you thought this was a novel approach that didn't have roots in history, the Court has many times recognized that outlier states aren't necessarily violating substantive due process. Leland versus Oregon, for example, was a case where Oregon was the only state in the nation that required defendants to prove their insanity beyond a reasonable doubt.
So I don't think that that's cause alone to -- to think that somehow this is violating a fundamental principle. And I think, actually, looking at the jury instructions in some of the cases that you mentioned, Justice Kagan, like Rex versus Arnold, the jury was instructed there that the defendant had to be shown to have no understanding or memory such that he could form no intent whatsoever. That is a -- a restrictive test of insanity.
It's focused on this same idea of cognitive incapacity -- Well, I -- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's less helpful to me to go over each case one by one than for you to tell me that if, you know, if I -- what I -- what I think is true is that the history, there's -- there's -- there's just a ton that suggests that -- that there was something more than a requirement that the defendant have -- be able to form an intent to kill. Does -- does Ms. Schrup then win? I don't think so, because Petitioner still bears the burden of trying to articulate with precision what that something more is.
And I -- You can -- -- think for this here -- You can, I mean, that was the point of my question, I think.
The law has many, many ways of, in different circumstances, trying to separate out individuals for whom the criminal justice system is just not going to work in terms of preventing, et cetera, the crimes. One, the wind blew my arm.
Okay? Two, duress, because in a duress case you're looking to see could the -- could the defendant have done otherwise. With insanity you're close to that. Often it's a question of could the defendant have done otherwise. And even where not, it is is this individual so different from an ordinary individual that it just doesn't make sense to apply the law? Now, if some something like that is going on, then my question, if, in fact, he's the dog, out.
Why isn't it? The dog told me to do it. Now, that's the fourth time I have asked that.
But I would like to know what you think about it. So these are obviously difficult questions, Justice Breyer.
They're ones that societies have wrestled with for centuries in trying to balance the medical and moral and legal judgments that go into crafting an insanity rule. This Court has long recognized that states have principal responsibility to do that. And I think that there are various ways states could decide that they want to distinguish between those two defendants. For one thing that cognitive incapacity test which focuses on whether the individual thinks that the person he shot was a dog, might be an easier inquiry for juries to undertake.
It might be a more readily-observable sign of mental illness and less likely to lead to confusion about what was actually in the defendant's mind and whether he was considering right versus wrong. A jurisdiction might also think that looking at considerations of individual culpability, they don't want an on/off switch for criminal responsibility but, rather, want to shift those considerations to the sentencing stage where a judge can take evidence and make a more nuanced determination of individual culpability. Ultimately -- How does that stay -- -- I think that these -- -- consistent with Apprendi, assuming we find that since the beginning of modern thought that there is an irreducible minimum of due process that requires the insane to be not convicted by a judge or put in a mental institution by a judge but by a jury? May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice? Yes. There would still be a question, Justice Sotomayor, of how you define who is the insane.
That's a legal concept. It's one that's yielded no single formulation. And I think for this Court to try to articulate a theory of moral culpability could throw into question state laws across the nation that are trying to make these difficult judgments. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Schrup, you have five minutes remaining. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I'd like to make three quick points: First, the problem with the mens rea approach, to get to Justice Breyer and Sotomayor's point, is that it scrapes out the why, the underlying motivation fueled by mental illness that explains a defendant's act.
And that has been a part of our history for centuries. And that gets to the dog or the dog example.
It's completely arbitrary.
I don't know why if you think -- why one defendant who thinks that a dog, he's shooting a dog, versus another one who thinks a dog is ordering him to shoot someone else, makes any difference whatsoever.
The first person is acquitted and let out on the streets and the second is put in jail and maybe put to death. The second piece of this -- and so there's no safety net, basically.
What Kansas does, actually, is even more extreme because it limits the kind of mental illness evidence that could come in, and it is essentially advocating -- it -- it never explains why or whether there is any light between the wild beast test and the M'Naghten I test, but either way it is fundamentally different than what we have had historically and what 48 jurisdictions retain. Second, I'd like to turn to my friend on the other side's notion that -- that there is some limits.
He actually doesn't suggest anything.
And if you look at page 39 and 40 of their brief, basically everything is up for grabs. There can be no mens rea.
They can make everything strict liability.
Duress, self-defense, all of these defenses are on the line because, according to them, all that's required in Kansas is a voluntary act and intentionality. And, finally, turning back to history, it's just not right to say that the right and wrong principle is a 19th Century invention. There is a wall of cases and authorities starting in the 1500s and continuing, uninterrupted, all the way through until 1843 when M'Naghten was formed. There's literally scores of cases, here and in England, applying the right and wrong principle. To contrast that with the test that they suggest, which is essentially the wild beast test, that was invoked maybe two or three times.
It was a blip. So history favors us.
And although due process is a rigorous burden for a petitioner to meet, we satisfy it here because they have taken something out of our fundamental criminal culpability, what we believe as a country, they have scraped it out and they are punishing the insane as a result. If this Court has no further questions, we would ask you to please -- Well, I would -- -- reverse the case. -- ask you a question if you -- if you've finished your -- your -- the comments that you want to make. In your reply brief you say that the state's premise is that insanity was traditionally tied to a lack of mens rea.
And you say -- you agree with that, right? It was tied to common law intent, if we use the term mens rea, but it was tied to common law intent, which is a very different term than what they used, Justice Alito. Well, you -- I -- I'll quote you: ""The state's premise is that insanity was traditionally tied to a lack of mens rea, true, but mens rea historically required precisely the moral blame worthiness that Kansas law now excludes."" So that's your historical position. That's half of our -- And how do you reconcile that with the fact that mens rea does not vary from crime to crime? So if that was the understanding of mens rea, that would apply in every case and there would have to be moral blame worthiness in every case, not just those where the -- the -- the lack of blame worthiness is attributable to mental -- to a mental disorder, however that is defined? If I'm understanding your question, Justice Alito, yes, mens rea, but mens rea historically or common law intent always contained this moral component, this -- Then it would -- -- intent to harm. -- apply across the board. It would, with the exception of -- It would apply -- -- perhaps strict liability. -- to the person who said I assassinated this political leader because he is an evil person -- Oh. -- and he is going to do evil things. No, Justice Alito, because the only people that were -- that this has traditionally been applied to are the insane and maybe infants and that's what -- And that's what you are arguing for, a separate insanity defense, and that was M'Naghten.
But that's inconsistent with the historical record as you, yourself, understand it, which is that it was tied to mens rea, which is categorical, applies in every single case.
What -- what is wrong with that? Our position is that to the extent it was tied to mens rea, inherent in the notion of mens rea was the ability to choose between right and wrong. So that is very different.
That is very different than what Kansas has today, which has no inquiry into that. I mean, these 18th Century cases that talk about moral capability or lack thereof in mens rea in the same breadth are hard to understand, but you have to take into account -- may I finish my sentence -- Certainly. -- Mr. Chief Justice? (Laughter.) That you have to take into account that people -- that the 18th Century and early 19th Century understanding of how the human mind works was very different from what we have today.
There wasn't even any -- any such thing as psychiatry in 1791 and it was in its infancy in 1868.
Is that wrong? Mr. Chief Justice? You may. I want to answer this succinctly.
It's not about what mental illness was or wasn't.
It's about how we treated insane people, this narrow group of them.
I think everybody knows who they are when they are forced to decide it.
And it's about not punishing people who don't know right from wrong. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-834, Kansas versus Garcia. General Schmidt. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a typical and recent year, more than 15 million Americans became victims of identity theft.
One-third of those had their personal information misused in an employment or tax-related fraud setting. Many of those victims were left to untangle reputations, eligibilities, and other finances.
That is why Kansas, like every other state, makes identity theft a crime.
Our laws apply in all settings to all people, citizen and alien alike. Respondents were convicted because they stole other people's personal information with intent to defraud.
But, in Respondents' view, these state criminal laws that govern everybody else do not apply to them.
They argue that Congress has, in effect, granted them special immunity because their intent was to obtain employment that Congress has forbidden. This Court never has so held and should not now.
The conflict fatal to the Arizona employment statute is not present here, because Kansas prohibits the theft of personal information by anybody, not work by unauthorized aliens.
And this Court has identified no preempted field relevant here. Section 1324a(b)(5) means what it says and no more.
The I-9 verification system is available only for specified federal uses. (b)(5)'s use limitation, which is quite different from typical preemption provisions, is one of several safeguards Congress adopted in 1986 to limit both governments' and employers' use of the then novel I-9 system. But traditional state criminal law still reaches misconduct elsewhere in the employment context if proven without use of the I-9 system.
For example, states certainly still may prosecute a felon who uses a stolen identity to defeat a background check as a condition of employment at a child care center, even if he also used the same stolen identity on his Form I-9.
So too with the tax withholding forms used here. But isn't it telling, General Schmidt, that in all three cases that we have, the prosecutor initially charged false Social Security number on the I-9, and it was only when the prosecutor appreciated that that couldn't be done that the I-9 charge was deleted? I think these cases are here, Justice Ginsburg, because they do, of course, present the issue of the intersection between IRCA and generally applicable state law. These cases all straddled, in their time lines, this Court's decision in Arizona.
And I think that explains why the state originally attempted to use the I-9, then understood this Court's holding in Arizona, and withdrew from use of the I-9. I would point out, Your Honor, that all three cases arose, were discovered, the fraud was discovered, in a context outside the employment setting.
This is not what was happening in subsequent cases in Arizona. Mr. Garcia's fraud was discovered first in a records check at a traffic stop; Mr. Morales, from a separate investigation related to workers' compensation; and Mr. Ochoa-Lara, from a separate investigation -- Do you -- -- of different criminal conduct in the department. -- do you agree that the result would be different if the information was harvested from the I-9s; in other words, if state officials went to employers, said let me see your I-9s, and then that is used to gather information that's used in the Kansas prosecutions? I think it likely would, Your Honor.
That is not what happened here, and it's not supported on these records. And I recognize that is a more difficult case. We concede that the state may not use the I-9 form.
Whether that extends to a use investigation, I think, is -- is perhaps a somewhat different question, not presented here. I recognize it's difficult, and we don't claim that ground, but I don't want to concede it more generally. But the package that was submitted to the employer was all in one package, the I-9, the withholding form, federal and state.
It's not that these were discrete episodes. It -- and -- and in all three cases, the tax form, the I-9, the state tax form was all for the same benefit, that was to gain employment.
You can't gain employment without filling out those withholding forms. That's true, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that speaks to the important distinction that's at issue in this case. Our view of what Congress did in 1986 against the backdrop of this Court's decision in DeCanas, that prior to IRCA the employment process generally was available to -- was within the scope of state criminal law. In 1986, Congress created something new and different.
It created this I-9 system which was a novelty at the time.
With the force of federal law, Congress was ordering millions of private employers around the country to gather up personal information of their employees or potential employees and to hold that information.
So Congress was understandably concerned about how employers and others might use that information.
That's why they put the safeguards in. The distinction, we believe, that's been drawn is between the I-9 system itself, which Congress created and placed off limits, and the broader employment hiring context, which states have traditionally been able to reach and we believe still can reach. And so, in the question that Your Honor has posed, the fact that documents might be submitted at the same time all for a purpose of obtaining a job does not transform tax withholding forms or any other hiring documents like a resume, a job application, a background check form, into part of the I-9 system. May I -- And that system is what's permitted. Can I unpackage your argument a little bit? Is it your position -- I seem -- you seem to be conceding that you can't use the -- prosecute for any false statements on the I-9 form, correct? Your Honor, as I've said to the Chief Justice, we aren't doing that. We concede -- we don't intend to do that.
I think -- All right. -- maybe for a broader purpose, that's a different case. So what meaning do you give to the part of the preemption language that says you can't use the form in any way? The precise language is, I think -- I don't have it. Is that the language in (b)(5), Your Honor, where the -- Exactly. -- where Congress -- So, if you can't use it in any way, why can you use the information contained therein for employment verification? Meaning I certainly do understand an independent verification, like a criminal check, criminal law check. But you're still using it for employment verification, correct? Well, I -- I think not, Your Honor.
And -- and -- and perhaps it's a linguistic distinction, but I want to be clear on what our point is. Well, that's why I'm having a problem, which is I'm not quite sure how the -- how -- We -- we -- -- you can concede one without conceding the second. -- we think that employment verification is -- is best used to describe the I-9 system that Congress created in the IRCA.
In that subparagraph (b) of IRCA, those first three paragraphs, Congress set up the system of attestation and related obligations.
That is what verifies employment, work authorization, for purposes of federal immigration law. There are other things in the employment context that may be disqualifying for obtaining a job, but those aren't, in our words, employment verification that Congress has spoken to. All right. It's so -- I understand that would -- -- it would be so easy to circumvent the I-9 then.
All they have to do is to switch to other forms submitted at the same time. Well, Your Honor, I -- I think I understand the point, and if I understand it correctly, it is that information that is false, stolen information from somebody else that is contemporaneously submitted to an employer, if it's not the same false information on an I-9 and other employment-related documents, it would necessarily reveal the fraud on the I-9, if I'm understanding Your Honor's question. That may well be.
But that doesn't change the fact that what Congress has fenced off here is the I-9 verification system, not the tax withholding system, not other aspects of the employment relationship. And if Congress had wanted to more broadly exclude states from that role, they knew how to do it. But the two things -- They -- Sorry.
The two things, as Justice Ginsburg points out, always go together, the I-9 form and the tax forms.
In virtually all employment, you're going to be asked for a Social Security number on both forms.
And so the states would, in essence, be able to go after unauthorized employment in a pretty substantial way, notwithstanding what Congress said about giving the federal government the role with employment verification. So how do you answer that concern, and, in particular, I think Arizona's language on unauthorized employment? And so, too, Justice Kavanaugh, ride together background checks for many, many jobs now, not just traditionally highly sensitive, teachers, for example, and employment application forms that -- Let's just focus -- let's just focus on the I-9 and the tax forms and Social Security numbers because that's -- Right.
And I -- -- what this is about.
And that's going to be what a lot of these cases are about, I would think, if you prevail here. Then I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that the -- the best answer to that is what Congress did not do.
And if one looks, for example, at 26 U.S.C. 7205, which is a specific federal crime that makes fraud on a W-4 form, I believe it's a federal misdemeanor, Congress did not carve that out in the use exception that it created in (b)(5). It is nearly nonsensical to think that Congress on the one hand would have created a specific crime for W-4 fraud and yet precluded its application in situations in which the W-4 is most commonly submitted, together with the I-9. It must be that Congress did not consider the umbrella of immunity as to the I-9 to extend so far as to hit the W-4, and, of course, Congress certainly didn't consider the immunity it was granting with respect to the I-9 to the extent it did to extend to the state tax withholding form, the K-4. You couldn't -- you couldn't sue or prosecute a case for someone's fraud on the W-4 and name the U.S. as a victim, correct? The fraud is on the government because W-4s are submitted to the government for tax purposes, correct? I -- I think -- You don't have the power as a state -- I am -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. I don't believe you have a power as a state to prosecute crimes where the U.S. is a victim. I -- I -- I am -- I am certain we don't do that, Your Honor. I know you don't. What I'm struggling with is -- It seems like there would be a real separation of powers, too. Yeah.
And I'm certain we're not claiming that authority, Your Honor.
We're not trying to -- So why is it -- -- vindicate the interests of the United States. -- permissible for you to prosecute or to claim there isn't a field preemption in doing exactly the same thing by calling this a fraud under state law, because the victim has to be the U.S. Well, I -- I'm -- I'm not sure the victim does have to be the United States, Your Honor.
I think the victims here are the individuals whose identities were stolen and misused. Ah, that's stolen Social Security, but that's different than the fraud that -- of submitting the W-4 to the government. I have a -- I do have problems with the K-4 for your other side to answer.
But your theory here on the K-4, I didn't see in the trial record where you argued that clearly to the three sets of juries. Your Honor, there was -- Garcia was the only case that went to a jury.
The other two were bench trials.
And the K-4 was present, I believe, in two of the cases, in Mr. Garcia's case and in Mr. Morales' case, it was at least in the charging affidavits.
I'd have to look at the record more carefully to see if it was -- if it carried through. With respect to the field issue, Your Honor, this Court has never identified a preempted field in the employment context that would be applicable here.
And to the extent that -- Well, Arizona. To -- well, I think that Arizona, as we read it at least, Your Honor, with respect to the employment provision, the 5(c) provision in Arizona, that was a conflict preemption analysis where Justice Kennedy writing for the Court suggested that, because of the method the state was using, the criminal law, Congress in that application in particular had declined to use the criminal law to criminalize work by unauthorized aliens. Here, that analysis isn't present at all.
Congress has criminalized fraud, as well as identity theft.
And so I think we're back in the traditional world where we have separate sovereigns who may go after the same conduct unless it's precluded, and here it is not. With respect to the field preemption issue as well, I think it would be difficult for this Court to recognize a preempted field now, particularly in light of the provision of the holding in Whiting, that was a conflict analysis holding, but related to the E-Verify system. It's difficult to imagine how there is a preempted field states may not enter, even as to employment verification narrowly, and yet, at the same time, it was permissible for the State of Arizona to order the use of the E-Verify system to verify employment under federal law. If I could go back to Justice Kavanaugh's question, because you've recognized that you can't use the I-9s to prosecute aliens in this way. But you also acknowledge that the W-4s are going to be present in every case in which the I-9s will be present, which gives you the ability to conduct all the prosecutions that you could have done through the I-9s. So what -- what effect then does -- does Congress's bar on states using the I-9s, in fact, have? I -- I think, Justice Kagan, back to my earlier point about what Congress was doing in our view in 1986, remember prior to 1986 there was no federally mandated very disparate requirement for collection of personal information throughout the country by employers. And Congress was very concerned about what now seems commonplace but at the time was novel.
They were concerned about how that information might be misused. And we think that explains the -- the Congress's choice of the language in (b)(5). They didn't use traditional preemption language as they did in (h)(2) as to employers.
If they wanted to exclude states from this area entirely, they could have done it, they did it in this statute, as to employers in (h)(2). But I think -- But they used different language in (b)(5), a more passive voice.
They didn't talk about states specifically at all or governments specifically at all.
They simply said that neither the form, nor information on it, nor anything -- the attachments to it, appended to it, may be used. And I think they were principally worried about how employers might misuse it.
Of course, I'm not suggesting they were inviting us.
I'm just suggesting that was their focus and why they wrote the provision the way they did. But let me -- let me ask the same question, maybe from a different perspective, which is our decision in Arizona, because our decision in Arizona said that states could, in fact, not prosecute unauthorized employees for seeking employment. And -- but this gives you a tool to do just that in every single case.
So essentially it eviscerates everything that we said in Arizona, doesn't it? Well, Your Honor, as I suggested earlier, the way we read the reasoning in Arizona is not applicable here.
So we think it is distinguished and -- and -- and separate. If this Court were to, in our view at least, extend Arizona to cover this circumstance, you know, we think that would be a very different type of case than we have. Well, you're talking about extending Arizona, but I'm suggesting that if you are right on this case, we -- we might as well not have issued Arizona. No, I think not, Your Honor, because, again, what the state is focused on here, and I don't think this is seriously disputed -- mildly, perhaps, in the record -- is vindicating its traditional interest in prosecuting fraud. The fact that incidentally our generally applicable laws intersect with the employment context or perhaps the immigration context does not mean that Congress has commanded, nor should we carve out, special application or lack of application of our general laws to persons because of their work authorization status. In other words, Arizona is a very different circumstance.
We aren't targeting folks because of their status.
We are enforcing our employment, our -- our identity theft laws, and we don't want to give special exception to that to people because of their status. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents stole the identity information of others and passed it off as their own on tax withholding forms.
There's no dispute that states could traditionally prosecute frauds and forgeries of that kind. The question is whether Congress withdrew that authority when it passed IRCA in 1986.
Congress did not.
IRCA is an immigration statute.
It set up a new system -- that's the employment verification system -- precisely to verify whether employees have work authorization as a matter of federal immigration law. Now IRCA put express limits on the use of the form that employees submit to document their work authorization.
And as the Court held in Arizona, IRCA also put implied limits on what court -- on what states can do to regulate work authorization. But nothing in IRCA diminished the states' long-standing power to prosecute crimes like this one, non-immigration offenses on non-immigration forms submitted for non-immigration purposes. And a statute designed -- as a statute designed to -- to prevent unauthorized work, IRCA certainly did not create unique immunities for unauthorized workers. Does this represent a change in the government's position? I thought the government's prior position was that on documents that the employee or the prospective employee is filing at the same time as the I-9, there would be preemption? No, Justice Ginsburg.
I think you're referring to the brief the government filed in the Ninth Circuit in the Puente Arizona case.
And in that brief, we took two positions that I think are relevant here. First, we took a position that's exactly the one we take here with respect to (b)(5), which is that that provision doesn't bar prosecution using forms other than the I-9. That's the express preemption argument. As to implied preemption, the government said in that brief that fraud on the work authorization process would be impliedly preempted, but the government at page 23 of that brief expressly said that fraud outside the work authorization process -- for example, on -- on tax withholding forms that we have here -- would not be preempted any more than state laws that regulate drugs or robbery or other regular crimes like this. Could you do this? Could a state have a law which says it is a crime for an alien to take information from the S form or other information that they give that's referred to in the federal statute, and it is a crime to do that and fraudulently give it to an employer for the purpose of obtaining a job? I think that that might be preempted under the -- Ah.
That -- well, is it or isn't it? Well, that -- In your opinion? I'm not holding you to it forever.
I just want to know. (Laughter.) I -- I think, of course, that is -- it's far removed from this case where -- Well, I'm not saying that yet. Yeah. I want to know if they could do that; in other words -- shall I repeat it? You -- you know what I said. Well, our -- our position, as we laid out in the Puente brief, is that a law that regulates fraud on the work authorization process, which I think is what your hypothetical was, although I'm not sure I've tracked every piece of it. What it does is it says that if you take information from the S -- is it S-9? Is that what it's called? The I-9. I-9 or these other papers that are referred to, and you, Mr. Alien, go and give it to an employer for the purpose of pretending that you're somebody you aren't so you'll get a job, would that be preempted? Yeah, I do think that would be preempted -- So do I. -- under our case. Now, if that's so, I just wonder how this differs, because it defines the state law as applied in this case, though it's much broader, but as this case as it was put in the arguments by the prosecutors and by the complaints and so forth, what he did was, what was charged was using identifying information or documents which are the same information as on the I-9, using it to defraud another person, which they did, I guess, in order to receive a benefit, which benefit was a job.
So they took information from the I-9, used it to defraud an employer in order to get a job. Now, if there is a difference between what I just said and what I'd said when I was asking you the question, I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I can help you out. Yes. I think it's the distinction -- and this is a critical one -- between work authorization, which is a defined -- which is a term of art under immigration law, in IRCA, and general requirements for obtaining a job, such as submitting a tax withholding form, submitting a background check.
Those are two quite different things. IRCA is an immigration -- as I said at the outset, an immigration statute that deals with work authorization to work in the United States.
There are other requirements of law. For example, 26 U.S.C. 3402 requires a tax withholding form.
But that has nothing to do with work authorization.
Regardless of your work authorization status, you still have to submit a tax withholding form. And I think one way to illustrate the distinction is that a U.S. citizen, who has undoubted work authorization, could submit the same materials that were submitted here, a false Social Security -- a stolen Social Security number on the I-9 and the tax withholding form, for example, to conceal a criminal conviction or sex offender status. All that's true, but the allegation in the criminal cases here, I think, were that the people, the defendants, were aliens and that, moreover, they submitted the information from the I-9 form -- it didn't say I-9 form, but it was from the I-9 form -- and they submitted it to get a job.
It said nothing about they submitted it to get a job because it showed we paid taxes. And I suspect they submitted it to get the job because the employer would think they were a different person. So, Your Honor, I think -- Where am I wrong on that? So I -- I think, at -- at a minimum, they submitted it for two different reasons.
One, perhaps to demonstrate work authorization, which it couldn't be clearer that Arizona is not prosecuting here -- I mean, excuse me, that Kansas is not prosecuting here because it dismissed the counts on the I-9. They also submitted it, and there is testimony in the record about this, that the employers would not have given them the jobs but for their submission of the tax forms. Well, then why isn't it -- And that's -- May I ask you a question about -- before your time expires, about the meaning of the language in (b)(5), any information contained in the I-9.
What does that mean? I think that simply means -- that simply covers everything that's on the I-9 form.
And that's an effort by Congress to cover broadly everything that's on the form, in case there were some creative prosecutor who wanted to say, well, we've extracted piece of the -- a piece of the I-9 and, therefore, we're not using the I-9 in violation of (b)(5). And even if this Court might not find that a very persuasive argument, I think it makes sense that Congress wanted to be doubly sure that they were covering the full form. I -- I still don't understand what you make of it and how it fits the language of the statute.
Information means generally a fact, all right? So facts contained in the I-9 would be the name, the Social Security number, the address, all the facts that the applicant for employment puts on the I-9. Now I agree that that -- it can't mean that.
That -- that produces ridiculous results. It can't mean that those facts can never be used by anybody for any purpose.
But I -- I don't quite see how -- I don't really understand -- your -- you mean -- you interpret this to mean they can't use the I-9 in -- in whole or they can't use the I-9 in part.
Isn't that -- that's what it comes down to. How does that fit the language of the statute? Oh, I think if you look at the full phrase, Justice Alito, which is ""use the I-9 or any information contained in the I-9,"" it -- I think it simply means that they can't use either the I-9 in whole or the information that appears on the I-9, which, you know, if you look at the I-9, which is in -- in our appendix, it has the Social Security number and other information like that. But you forget the rest of it, which says for purposes only related to the fraud sections of the -- the federal code.
So it does seem to me to be limiting the use for fraud related to employment verification -- Yes. -- to seeking a job. That last point, I think, is the critical one.
Work authorization under immigration law is not the same thing as seeking a job in general.
And to go back to the point I was making to Justice Breyer, if you allowed prosecution of that U.S. citizen -- I mean if you allowed preemption of the prosecution of a U.S. citizen who committed -- who gave exactly the same forms here, you would be letting immigration -- you would be -- But why? The whole focus -- -- letting preemption flow from -- I didn't do that.
I would just say, if this statute is used by a state to prosecute, roughly, the very thing that the federal statute reserves to the federal government, they can't.
And so the question is, is it the very thing? And -- And then my -- my question has been trying to figure out why isn't the very thing? Because it certainly sounds like the very thing. I agree that the term sounds similar, but I do think it would be a mistake to -- to be confused by that because work authorization is very different than -- Well, Mr. Michel -- -- getting a job. -- let me put the same sort of question in another way, because when you were speaking with Justice Breyer, you said that a state law that regulates fraud in the work authorization process would be preempted. And I guess the question here is Kansas has a generally applicable law, but even generally applicable laws can be used to regulate fraud in the work authorization process, and when a statute, even though generally applicable, is used in that way, shouldn't the same results follow? May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice? Yes. Yes.
The answer is yes. And that, I think, was manifested in this case by Kansas dismissing the I-9 charges.
Those were the charges that related to work authorization, which is the purpose of IRCA. These other charges that related -- that related to matters not related to work authorization were not preempted by IRCA, which is, after all, an immigration statute, and, therefore, were properly not preempted. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hughes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the rule that we asked the Court to adopt: States may not prosecute individuals for using false information to demonstrate work authorization under federal immigration law. To put this slightly differently, if to satisfy an element of a state offense the state proves that an individual used false information to show federal work authorization, IRCA preempts the prosecution. If this element is not present, there is no IRCA preemption. Even if they were applying to a college? Meaning -- I'm sorry. You can answer that question after your time has -- I'm sorry. Thank you, Your Honor. IRCA requires preemption here because Kansas prosecuted Respondents for using false information to demonstrate federal work authorization. Kansas chose to prosecute fraud claims.
One element it had to prove was that Respondents used deceit to obtain property. Kansas had one theory.
Respondents used false information to show employment eligibility and, thus, they obtained jobs. Had Respondents used truthful information, Kansas maintains, they would not have been hired because of federal immigration law. In the intermediate state court, Respondents argue that the state had insufficient evidence to prove the benefit element.
Adopting the state's argument, the Court held that Kansas satisfied the requirements of state law by proving that Respondents wrongfully showed that they were eligible for employment. Now, according to the Kansas Supreme Court, ""the state seeks to punish an alien who used the personal identifying information of another to establish the alien's work authorization."" Indeed, Kansas initially charged Respondents with fraud on the I-9.
While it dropped those charges, its theory of the prosecution remained exactly the same.
For purposes of preemption, the label a state attaches to its regulation is not relevant. What matters is what the state actually regulates. So, here, Kansas is prosecuting the use of false information to show work authorization under federal immigration laws. Kansas has charged two state offenses, both of which include the element of an intent to defraud. If -- if the -- the I-9 process, the -- the individual applying for authorization uses a false Social Security number, can that number ever be used to prosecute him for identity theft? Yes, it can, Your Honor. Our theory of preemption is a limited one.
In our view, what federal law preempts is a prosecution for the use of false information with respect to showing that somebody is authorized under the federal immigration laws for employment.
That is the element that federal law preempts. If a prosecution -- I'm sorry, just -- so the Social Security number is used in the I-9 process to establish work authorization? Yes, Your Honor. And the state can use that number so long as it's not being used to show work authorization? That's right, Your Honor. If a state offense has unrelated to work authorization, our theory of preemption does not apply.
In our view -- Including -- including to get a job, right? In other words, work authorization and applying to get a job are, as Mr. Michel told us, two different things? I think that's inaccurate, Your Honor, because the way the state prosecuted here was absolutely tethered to federal work authorization.
And there are a few different ways that we know this is true. First, if the Court looks to the -- the brief that the state submitted -- I don't mean to -- just so I make sure where your head -- that we're on the same page, so you would say that the Social Security number, even though it's information contained on the I-9 in the process, can be used, say, to get a driver's license but not to get a K-4? Well, I -- I think that's right, Your Honor.
So, if this is tied to federal work authorization, that is where preemption occurs.
And we know that that is the theory of prosecution in these cases. How are you defining work authorization, just so I'm clear on the answer to the Chief Justice's question? Yes, Your Honor.
This is incorporated from federal law.
So the question is, is an element of the offense that an individual was showing as a matter of federal law that they were authorized for employment. If that is the nature of the fraud, then that is something that solely the federal government is authorized to prosecute. If it's not that theory, our theory of preemption does not apply in those circumstances. Mr. Hughes, give us some examples.
That was my earlier question. Examples -- Let's assume -- you mentioned getting a driver's license or getting into a college or getting a credit card. Let's assume that false information was used for any of those processes. Our theory of preemption does not apply to any of those, Your Honor. All right.
But let's assume that the question the college asks is simply are you authorized to work in the United States. If the element is are you authorized as a matter of federal immigration law to work in the United States, and somebody commits fraud in answering that question, that is what federal law preempts. And so our theory of preemption is a straightforward one that we think is easily applied, which is just the question of is this an element that is necessary to the state offense. If it is, there's preemption.
If it's not, there's no preemption. Are you -- How about -- So -- -- how about a -- a form that you file so that your employer will directly deposit your pay into your bank account? So, Your Honor, if there is -- the element that I just described is not present, we don't think there's preemption.
And -- and let me say -- But the -- the -- the specific question, the form is submitted so that your pay will go directly into your bank account.
Is that preempted or not? Well, Your Honor, and -- and, again, to answer the hypothetical, I have to know if the prosecution includes an element of -- of -- of what the -- what the fraud is, because, in that theory, Your Honor, it's not clear why the use of a false Social Security number would be relevant, or would be a material aspect, but -- but, if it is, that prosecution could proceed.
So -- States -- states may impose requirements for particular jobs or maybe even for all jobs, but let's just stick to particular jobs that go beyond the requirements necessary for obtaining any employment in the United States, such as information for a criminal background check or to prove age that's a requirement for the job, using dangerous machinery. Does your argument apply to that? No, Your Honor.
If the state has those sorts of requirements that are unrelated to the federal immigration laws, and they -- there's a valid state law that requires information at the time of hiring for those reasons, our argument does not apply and preemption does not -- So counsel -- So, if the K-4 serves a purpose other than policing compliment with the federal requirement for obtaining work, then that would be sufficient? Well, I think -- and let me be quite clear about this, Your Honor -- I think if the state had charged this as simply the Kansas misdemeanor offense, which is making a false statement on a state tax form, I think we would have a very different case in that circumstance. Why does it matter? Because the -- the distinction, Your Honor, is because when the state prosecutes using -- and the theory is false information to show federal employment authorization, that is an immigration offense. That's an immigration offense that's defined by IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act. That's an immigration offense that is -- is regulated by the federal immigration -- So if a state -- So, to make all these distinctions that you're talking about, you look to the elements of the state law or you look to the underlying conduct or you look to both? How does it work? Your Honor, I think you look to the elements and then you understand, as applied in that context, what is the theory that the state is offering to prove the elements of that offense? So -- Well, on the elements of this offense, it's just, as I understand it, using someone else's identity. Right? It's to receive a benefit, Your Honor.
And it's that receipt of the benefit that is the necessary element. Okay.
The receipt of the benefit could be a completed form that's required by the state for other purposes besides immigration law. Your Honor, if the state were -- Because you concede the form could be used for other purposes, right? Your Honor, if a state -- But we agree the state form can be used for other purposes besides compliance with the immigration laws, right? Yes, I think I agree with you, Your Honor, yes. Okay.
All right.
I think we have to, right? I mean, states are allowed to enforce their tax laws, right? Yes, of course, of course. Okay.
So a false statement on that form could be for other purposes, and it's not essential to the crime of -- of identity theft, is it? That's right, Your Honor. And our point, though, is the state, if the state had wanted to charge this as a state tax offense, of saying we have these state tax forms, you've put inaccurate information on -- No, no, but even identity theft, would -- would you concede then that a state could have an identity theft case based on this same form? Your Honor, I think the question is what their theory of benefit is, what is the intent to defraud -- So it's not about the elements.
It's about the theory, the facts and their intentions. Well -- well, Your Honor, there is a -- an element of the -- the offense, the intent to defraud, and then the state applying that to the individual circumstance has to show what the intent to defraud in that particular case is. If a -- I'm sorry -- if a -- if a state passes a law making it a serious felony to use a false Social Security number on a state tax form, is that state law preempted? I -- I don't think so under our theory, no, Your Honor. Well, how is that different than -- Because that's not what Kansas has done here.
What Kansas has done here -- And why exactly is it different from what Kansas has done here and how does that fit with your implied preemption theory of enforcement discretion, which I thought was tied to the use of the false Social Security number? Your Honor, what Kansas has done here is it is on its face objectively prosecuting an immigration offense, because it has said repeatedly in the lower courts that necessary to show it's -- that the intent to deceive element, was showing that individuals used false information to show that they were eligible under federal law to hold employment when they were, in fact, not. What type of -- Well, Mr. Hughes, it just seems a -- a -- a little bit odd to look to, you know, particular statements that Kansas made in order to determine whether a particular prosecution is preempted. So that's why I asked the question that I asked.
It's like how as a general matter do you go about determining whether a prosecution is preempted? Well, Your Honor, I think it's the same analysis the Court used in a case like Buckman, for example, and Buckman is looking at general state fraud laws and said, well, this is fraud on the FDA.
How do we know if this is within the range of things that are preempted? And one of the tests that Buckman used, I think, is directly relevant here, is Buckman said state laws in that context were not simply parallel to federal laws, but, in fact, the state offense was derivative of the federal offense because one of the critical requirements to show the state law fraud was showing that there was an underlying violation of the FDA's own regulations -- So, Mr. Hughes -- -- that led to that fraud. -- just to follow up on -- on Justice Kagan's question, if the -- if Kansas's theory of the benefit in this case were that by filing a W-4, the defendant had an intention to comply with Kansas tax law, would that be un-preempted in your -- in your theory? Your Honor, if there -- I think -- I think that would be safe, right? I think that might be, Your Honor.
I think, though -- Okay.
So -- -- that the state might have a difficult -- -- so we really are down to drawing distinctions on preemption here based on Kansas's particular intentions in a particular case. Well, it's the nature of how they're applying the intent-to-defraud element in that context.
We certainly don't think that all of Kansas's ID fraud laws are -- are preempted, nor are all ID fraud offenses with respect to Social Security numbers. But, again, Mr. Hughes, the idea of it's -- it's because of how they're applying their law, how do we know how they're applying their law at the outset, right? We want to make these decisions at the outset.
Can this prosecution go forward or can it not? How do we know how they're applying their law in this particular case? I think, as a practical matter, Your Honor, what would happen in a case like this is, if the state charges somebody with this issue that is around a hiring offense, saying that there's identity theft, the defendant under the rule that we permit -- or we -- we advance would be entitled to file a motion to dismiss that charge, saying this charge is preempted by federal law, and the state would then have an opportunity to say no, that is not the theory of -- of prosecution that we advance in this particular case. Mr. Hughes, can I ask you to bring your answer to a more practical answer, which is how would you think -- give me a hypothetical or even this -- why this case differs from the case you think is not preempted? This -- By that, I mean what do you see in the -- what are the words in the charge here that are different than the words that you think are not preempted? So I think looking just to the charge itself can be difficult, Your Honor, because the state charges often are -- That's why the Kansas court went to the -- to -- Right.
But -- but, Your Honor, I think -- -- to the as applied challenge. However, the state appellate court said that this goes directly to employment eligibility, and this is exactly how when the -- the Respondents challenge saying you've not provided us sufficient evidence to show the benefit element, the state was obligated to say here's the evidence that we have shown that satisfies the benefit element. What was the evidence they provided? It was exclusively eligibility for employment that's tethered to federal -- So Kansas -- -- immigration law. -- will never make that mistake again, Mr. Hughes. Your Honor, there -- And in every future case, they will say the benefit that the defendant is seeking is the opportunity to comply with our tax laws and our -- our revenue laws.
And -- and -- and that will be the end of that. So we are -- we are deciding how many angels are dancing on the head of this pin? Is that what -- is that what this case is about? I disagree with that for a few reasons, Your Honor.
First, they still have to convince a jury that there is, in fact, a benefit, and I think there might be some -- Sure.
No, of course, they have to.
Of course, they have to. But it's not preempted, and none of these cases will ever be preempted again after today. Well, a few things about that, Your Honor.
First, there are other ways to comply with the K-4 without using somebody else's Social Security number, including, for example, using an I-10, an individual taxpayer identification number.
So that is a way that that might happen. But every time an employee uses a false identification number in these cases, Kansas will use a different set of magical words, and that will be the end of this problem? But, Your Honor, what the distinction is, is while Kansas may prosecute a wide range of -- of offenses on its tax system, and we certainly don't disagree with that, what Kansas might not do is have its own individual immigration policy and immigration offenses. I think I agree with you there are ways that Kansas can charge similar sorts of conduct when it relates to the tax system that is not a state adopting its own immigration system.
And I think -- What type of -- I was going to say just -- just to conclude with that point, Your Honor, I think to the extent that this is, as you suggest, angels dancing on a pin, I think that suggests the opposite conclusion, precisely as to why preemption is warranted here because of how Kansas charged this case. And if that is where -- where the Court agrees, then there shouldn't be any concerns about -- Then why shouldn't we DIG this case? I mean, if this is about a one-off prosecution that has no chance of recurring ever again and, you know -- I mean, I know you're vigorously defending your client, but we don't usually take cases that have such limited application. We would perfectly welcome a DIG, Your Honor.
I think that would be an appropriate outcome in this case. (Laughter.) What type of -- what type of -- Touche. -- preemption are you relying on? What type of preemption are you relying on? Your Honor, we argue both express preemption on the language of 1324a(b)(5) as well as conflict with -- or, sorry, with -- as well as implied, with respect to implied -- I -- I don't see how you get express preemption out of (b)(5).
And I don't know what the conflict is.
What is the conflict? The conflict is the similar sorts of conflicts that the Court recognized with respect to Section 3 of SB 1070. But what -- what is the conflict? The conflict is the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, how the federal government uses prosecutorial discretion to establish a consistent -- Well, how do we know -- -- federal immigration -- -- that the federal government has taken the position that this particular case or cases of this particular type shouldn't be prosecuted? This is not a situation like Arizona, where a state has criminalized something that is not criminal under federal law. It's a case where the same conduct is criminal under federal law and, Kansas says, under Kansas law.
So where's the conflict? Your Honor, that was exactly the case with respect to Section 3 of SB 1070, where the state had adopted precisely the federal standards in assessing what was the underlying state offense, and they still found preemption. What is the conflict? The federal government doesn't say this is contrary to our -- our enforcement priorities. The conflict is states having independent immigration policies that differ from how the federal government has established the priorities with respect to both which tools to use for enforcement, as well as which -- who to, in fact, prosecute. But you conceded that a state could pass a law making it a felony to use a false Social Security number on a state tax form. Your Honor, and that would not be an immigration offense, and that would not be a state having its own individual immigration policy. But that would be -- but that would certainly be a way for a state to target people who are non-citizens who are unlawfully in the country from obtaining employment by enacting such a law.
So I guess, following up on Justice Alito's question, I'm not sure if that's not a conflict, why there's a conflict here? Your Honor, if there is an underlying targeting that is the intent behind that law, I think that that might be susceptible to other challenges, not the ones we bring here, but related to either constitutional claims or selective enforcement or other kinds of challenges to that. That is, by no stretch, the argument, though, that we press in this case. So the specific -- to follow up again on Justice Alito's, the specific reason that that's not a conflict but this case is a conflict is? The specific reason is because the federal government establishes a uniform immigration policy with respect to who they're going to prosecute and who not, and that has immigration consequences. But, beyond that, I think our field preemption argument is an extraordinarily strong one because all of the criteria that existed with respect to Section 3 of SB 1070 are present here.
There is the exact same sort of comprehensive and systematic system of immigration, civil and criminal penalties. And only the federal government can exercise many of the forms of discretion that are baked into those enforcement mechanisms.
So just to offer one example, it is a deportable offense to use false information in order to have fraud on the federal employment verification system. However, there's a discretionary exception to that.
If an individual enters the United States as a lawful permanent resident and then is working solely to support his or her own immediate family, the federal immigration authorities can waive deportation in those circumstances. Only the federal government can balance that policy as an immigration matter. When the states prosecute, the only remedy is the state criminal offense and not the graduated and varying mechanisms that the federal government had available. If the -- if the person whose identity is stolen has, let's say, five dependents and the applicant for employment has no dependents but puts down five dependents so less money will be withheld under federal and state law, could that applicant be prosecuted for that offense? Your Honor, as I've said, our theory is that yes, applicants can be prosecuted -- sorry, the -- the -- the -- the immigrant who has put down the information can be prosecuted? Yes, Your Honor.
I think that an alien who uses false information can be prosecuted for state tax offenses. Now Kansas has made quite clear in their brief, I think this is at page 10 of the reply brief in a footnote, that they chose not to pursue tax offenses in this particular case. That was a decision that I think rested on Kansas, as to whether or not they would pursue this as a tax offense case, and they said quite clearly they did not and declined to pursue a prosecution in that fashion. Now employment eligibility here -- much has been made from -- from the government that employment eligibility is separate from work authorization.
That is not the circumstance here because we know that Kansas said so in its briefs below. In the petition -- the appendix that we -- Why should we worry about the briefs below? I -- I guess I'm following up on Justice Gorsuch's question.
We have a serious issue that's going to affect how -- how states go forward here, and particular statements in the briefs below are -- should not define that.
They'll just use different statements next time. Well, Your Honor, I think the point is -- I -- I think there are two points.
First is what is the rule the Court should adopt.
And we have said our rule -- Right. -- that we think the Court should adopt is that a state offense is preempted if an element of that is use of false information to show federal employment authorization under the immigration laws. And the second question is the applicability of that in the context of this case.
Of course, that is something the Court could leave for remand if the Court agrees and adopts our rule, which would be an appropriate way to do it, but I think it's at least telling that what the state has done in this case is brought a prosecution that looks exactly like the same prosecution if they were prosecuting for fraud on the I-9 itself. And so we know that from 1324a(b)(5) that Congress in enacting IRCA in 1986 made the determination that states may not prosecute fraud on the I-9 itself. I think it would not do much to that statute if states can prosecute the exact same theory, the exact same kind of immigration offense, simply if they look at the K-4 or the W-4 forms and -- and -- and disclaim reliance on the I-9. I'm repeating myself now, but you've said many times the state could have a law prohibiting false statements on the K-4. Yes, I think they could, Your Honor, that's right, and that wouldn't be an -- And -- -- immigration offense and that would not be -- -- and you've said that's fine, even though that might be the same kind of conduct that would be done on the I-9? Your Honor, I think if somebody were challenging that law, it would be an argument that's different than the sort of argument that we're advancing for you here.
I'm not saying -- Well, they're not challenging the law.
They would be challenging the application of the law and the use of the law in a particular prosecution, much as you're doing here. And the question is, why would there be a different result? Well, I don't think that would be preempted, Your Honor, because it would not be prosecuting an immigration offense.
I think an as-applied challenge would probably be a challenge that would be based on selective prosecution, if that were a theory that were available given the facts.
I can't say that it would, but that would be the way that that law would likely be challenged. So, in fact, the -- the -- here, the state is prosecuting this person for using this false information which is on the I-9, or wherever, in order to show that he has federal authorization to work and, thereby, is entitled to a job, which is the property which he tried to get through deception? Is that right? Yes, Your Honor. And in a different case, they might not use the words in their brief.
They might not use the words he was trying to get the job by showing he was federally authorized. But I suppose that those were the facts.
So they'd be rather pressed to use different words unless the facts were different. Is that not so? I -- I think that's -- I mean, if they were trying to get a job by using this to show that they were in the hospital, then the defense would say, or the prosecution would say, they -- they -- they showed they were in the hospital. And if they tried to get it through showing authorization, federal, the prosecution would say that.
Wouldn't they have to? I -- I think that's right, Your Honor.
And that just goes to say that when, during the course of the prosecution, the prosecutor is going to have to identify what the theory of the fraud is. Yes. And they're going to have to put that before the jury.
And if the theory of the fraud is you've used false information to show compliance with federal work authorization requirements, that is preempted. And if that is not what the prosecutor is arguing, if they have a different application of the general statement of that clause -- So is it up to the defense lawyer in the -- in the court -- I mean, I don't know if you could always say this, but say to the -- to the jury: Jury, they've used the word fraud to obtain a benefit, but they have not explained to you how that fraud was used to obtain a benefit.
They do not have witnesses who -- you see, et cetera. What I'm driving at is this is not a one-off case that will never occur again, but, rather, it will occur in every instance where the facts justify it. Well, that's right, Your Honor. Am I right, or, no, don't say I'm right if I'm wrong. (Laughter.) No, you -- you're right, Your Honor.
And I think, as you -- you suggest, this will come out in the context of something like a motion for acquittal. But I'll also say the rule that we advance is in -- in -- in large measure a prophylactic rule because prosecutors engage in good faith.
And if the Court identifies this clear rule that we've advanced that prosecutions, state prosecutions, can't turn on the element of use of false information to show federal work authorization, I think we can rely on prosecutors won't bring those charges that have that as a particular element. And if there are charges that are close to the line, then those are things that trial courts will figure out in the course of motions for acquittal or motions to dismiss or motions in limine, and that will be sorted out based on the actual evidence that was put before in the particular case. But I do think the prophylactic nature of this rule is in keeping with exactly what the structure Congress created in IRCA.
I don't think there's any other way to understand what 1324a(b)(5) does.
Again, I believe Kansas is in agreement that they can't prosecute fraud if the fraud is on the I-9 itself. And in every case there is going to be a K-4 and a W-4, in every single case.
And so, if -- if Kansas is correct about a federal preemption in this context, 1324a(b)(5) did effectively nothing -- So the state can't -- -- when Congress enacted it. -- according to you, can't have a law that says you can't have a job in this state unless you submit a K-4? Kansas -- sorry, a state -- Kansas can't say, have a law, that says you can't have a job in this state without a K-4? I think Kansas probably -- I don't think there's a federal preemption problem with that.
And, again, as we -- So why isn't that this case? They're saying they couldn't get this job unless they submitted the K-4? That -- that's not this case because that is not the State of Kansas law.
Under Kansas law, it's actually to the opposite.
As we noted in Footnote 8 of our brief, Kansas law does not require the submission of a K-4 at the time of hiring. As a matter of fact, it generally does occur.
But Kansas state law specifically provides for individuals to be hired without submitting a K-4.
So there's simply not the theory of -- of prosecution that was available to Kansas in the facts of this case and not what it was that they, in -- in fact, advanced. So, ultimately, again, we think that this is a narrow case, that use of false information to show federal work authorization is the element that is preempted. It's a clear rule.
It's a rule that the trial courts across the states can regularly implement.
We think it's the only rule that actually gives effect to what Congress did in 1324a(b)(5).
Absent that rule, states would be eligible to prosecute the exact same offense that I think everybody agrees is expressly preempted under -- under the -- the -- the text of IRCA so long as it's given a different name. And that's simply not how preemption works.
As this Court has said repeatedly, preemption looks to what the state of the facts regulating -- Excuse me. -- not the label that the state uses for the prosecution. How is it expressly preempted under (b)(5)? That argument mystifies me, because (b)(5) says nothing about work authorization.
It says nothing about aliens. It says nothing about the use of the information by a state government or by the federal government.
It applies to any use. How you can read the argument that you're making into (b)(5) is something that escapes me.
Can you explain that? So a -- a few things, Your Honor.
First, I think (b)(5) certainly identifies the policy that Congress enacted which informs our arguments under field preemption.
And I think that may in part be the best way to look at this. But, second, with respect to -- to (b)(5) itself, I don't think there is much dispute that it is a preemption provision, because I think the -- the federal government has agreed that it means you can't prosecute fraud on the I-9 form itself. The real question is, what is the breadth of that express preemption provision? And what Kansas has suggested is that it's either all or nothing, that either it -- the -- the language and any information contained in effectively does nothing because it reduces just to what the form is or -- or a partial aspect of the form, or, if you give any meaning to that language, then there's no limitation and everything is fair game. That is not how the Court should interpret this and that's not how the Court interprets preemption statutes more broadly. Take, for example, the Maracich v. Spears case where the Court was assessing the language in connection with this. No, but you want us to say -- you say it's expressly preempted, even though all of the elements, practically all of the elements of the rule that you're advocating are not mentioned at all in (b)(5).
But you want us to read all of those in and then say this is an express -- this expressly preempts. Now you may have a good argument under some other category of preemption, but how it can be expressed and how it can be express preemption is really -- is really something. Well, this is information that is contained in and they're using it for the same purposes that underlie (b)(5), which is showing -- But did I -- -- federal employment authorization. -- understand you to say that you thought your better theory was field preemption, not express preemption? I -- I think they're both good theories, Your Honor, but, yes, I think the (b)(5) points up to field preemption and I think field preemption is a very strong theory for us because this -- we have direct congressional direction that establishes the -- the balance between the states and the federal government. And in (b)(5), whether one thinks that that is express preemption or not, I think it -- it undeniably identifies the policy judgment of Congress that the federal government alone should have the authority to prosecute these immigration offenses. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, General Schmidt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to try to make three points. With respect to Justice Alito's line of questioning on the (b)(5) language, (b)(5) is certainly, if read as a preemption provision, most unusual, at -- not least of which is because it is not aimed exclusively at states. Preemption is a supremacy clause concept that regulates the relationship between the federal government and states. But (b)(5) speaks not only to that but also to the relationship between the law Congress passed and what the federal government may do, and, most importantly, as I was discussing earlier with Justice Kagan, what private employers may do with this information that they were compelled to collect and maintain in a novel manner back in 1986. And we think that explains your earlier question, Justice Alito, with respect to what does ""information contained in"" mean.
We think it is an effort by Congress to make absolutely clear, not just to states and not just to the federal government, but to millions of private employers who now must by command of federal law maintain this private information, that they may not use the form or information harvested from the form or information attached and submitted for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the form.
We don't think express preemption gets them there. Second, with respect to the benefit question, which I think goes perhaps to -- I'm not sure if it goes to conflict or -- or field, I'm a little uncertain about that -- but on the benefit issue, I -- I -- I -- the -- the -- what we agree is off limits is the I-9 system. We aren't arguing that Kansas prosecuted these individuals because they were trying to commit fraud on the I-9 system.
We're arguing that they defrauded folks whose identities were stolen and that we used as evidence the W-4 and K-4 tax forms.
We didn't use the I-9 system. With respect to the notion that somehow preemption turns not on the intent of Congress but on the subjective intent of the offender, that turns preemption analysis on its head. And a hypothetical I think that illustrates that, imagine that let's say Mr. Garcia on the facts here were stopped for speeding not because he was headed to a job he already had but because he was headed with completed employment forms, applications in the back of his car, to apply for the job. He still would be guilty of the same state law crimes of identity theft.
His intent was to obtain the benefit of employment.
But he never arrived at the employer to apply for the job in the first place.
That can't be the test that makes the difference here. And, finally, with respect to the -- the notion of what the state is asking for here, we're -- we're a little unclear on exactly what field our friends on the other side think is preempted. As I suggested earlier, if there is one, it has to be extremely narrow, the I-9 system itself, but we're not sure a field exists there because of the decision in Whiting that states may compel the use of the E-Verify system, which certainly is part of work authorization. So this Court has never identified a field and should not with respect to this case. The conflict, we don't see.
The conflict that was present in Arizona, as we discussed earlier, is not present here.
This is a fundamentally different case. Kansas is not trying to act as an immigration enforcer but to enforce our generally applicable identity theft laws. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-556, Kansas versus Glover. General Crouse. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Reasonable suspicion is a minimal standard.
It permits a brief investigation upon an officer's objective and particularized suspicion.
Common-sense judgments and inferences about ordinary expenses -- experiences are the touchstone of reasonable suspicion. Here, Deputy Mehrer found a vehicle on the road, learned that the registered driver was incapable of lawfully operating that vehicle, had the belief that under common sense the registered owner was likely the driver, pulled the vehicle over, initiated the stop, cited the individual for being a habitual violator. That common-sense belief that Deputy Mehrer had is one that has been recognized by the judges in 12 state supreme courts, four circuit courts of appeals across the country, and that is that finding the registered owner of the vehicle as a driver is a common-sense inference, absent information to the contrary. Some may argue that the existence of a suspended license would undermine that suspicion, but the, of the 16 courts that I just mentioned, 11 of them have dealt with this precise situation, and the judges of those courts have indicated that reasonable suspicion continues to exist even in that circumstance. Indeed, the factual predicate for the habitual violator law across the country is that the registered owner may be continuing to drive. And the only thing we're asking here is whether or not there's reasonable suspicion to investigate further. Here, Deputy Mehrer relied upon the common-sense understanding that a registered owner, given the pervasiveness of automobile use in the United States, was likely to be driving again, warranted additional investigation.
To borrow a phrase from Terry, it would have been poor police work for Deputy Mehrer not to initiate the stop in this case and investigate further to confirm or dispel his suspicion. At this point, I would invite any questions from the Court. Mr. Crouse, many of those cases that you referenced involved at least an officer who testified, speaking about, in his experience, drivers tend to be owners. We don't have anything like that here. We have -- We don't. -- we have an officer who said he assumed that.
And that's a pretty unusual -- you're asking us to make an inference about facts when there are no facts in the record at all, zero. Well -- What do we do about that? So, to -- to the contrary, we believe that the stipulations are the facts. Well, the stipulation, as I understand it, though, is the officer said he assumed. Yeah. Yeah. So -- We don't -- we don't have any ""in my experience,"" nothing -- no -- nothing -- So -- so there are two aspects to that. -- other than an assumption. First of them is with regard to the stipulations, the parties have stipulated as to what the relevant facts were. If they believed there was information absent from those facts, they -- they could have and would have done that. I think this Court's cases have recognized -- I believe it was the Christian Legal Society's motion -- Maybe I'm not being clear what I'm -- what I'm getting at.
In most cases, officers have testified that ""in my experience,"" so we have some factual basis for a judge to then make a legal conclusion that the officer's stop was reasonable. Yeah.
And -- Here, we don't have any facts from the government, from the officer -- So I -- -- about experience or realities on the ground.
And yet you're asking the judge to make a legal conclusion about certain facts on the ground that are not present in the record.
It's almost like a judicial notice of facts not in record. Well, so -- Is that a thing? -- so what I -- what I would agree with is that there is no evidence or testimony as to the history and experience of this officer.
Rather, we know that he's a certified law enforcement officer.
And none of the cases that I've found have relied upon an officer's understanding of whether or not a registered owner is frequently the driver. Rather, the courts have indicated, as a matter of common sense and ordinary human experience, that the registered owner is a -- is likely the driver. But don't -- but -- I -- I admit -- I -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please. I admit there's three cases that hold that, but not 11.
The others do talk extensively about the officer's experience.
What I want to know is -- and I thought that the Kansas court had somewhat limited it, although it had broad language on corroborating that could be questioned, how corroboration could happen. But, in most of the others that Justice Gorsuch is talking about, the officer doesn't say ""I assume."" He says something more like, this has been my experience or this is the training, or the statistics that you put into the record in this case are presented to the judge. Why is the Supreme Court better able than the trial court, who's the finder of fact, to make decisions about what common sense teaches? So -- Or with the lack of anybody with experience in the field.
At least there was one judge below who said: In my experience, that presumption doesn't make sense. And I'm presuming that three other courts have said the opposite, but the supreme court here, the Kansas Supreme Court, agreed with the judge below. Yes.
So -- so let me address a couple things.
First, the assumption. We don't believe there's a legal distinction between assumption, presumption, inference, belief, or the otherwise.
I think this Court's cases, whether it be Terry, Cortez, Wardlow, or any of the others, may -- refer to that term. So the reference as to assumption, we don't read a difference into that. But, rather, what we understand is that reasonable suspicion is something of common understanding and ordinary human experience that whether or not the registered owner is the driver is not something that we would look to the law enforcement officer's history and expectations about.
Rather, those cases come up -- such as Cortez, in which we would have an international trafficking situation -- instead more like Navarette, it's common understanding that individuals will be driving under the influence and have certain particular behavior. In Wardlow, flight from the presence of law enforcement officers would be something of common -- But I think -- -- ordinary understanding. -- Navarette had to do with the -- with the reliability of the tips -- the tip -- So -- -- and not with questions -- I know that the majority and the dissent in Navarette argued about what the presumption should be.
That's why it's so dangerous -- So -- -- for us to make our own presumptions and not let the fact finder. Well, but -- so a couple of things.
One is I think this Court has done it in Navarette.
There was a reliability issue. But also with regard to whether or not it's sufficient to justify an investigation as to that particular crime. Here, the crime is driving while under the -- or driving while suspended.
And having -- But the -- but the cause for the suspension can be a number of things that have nothing to do with safety on the roads.
It could be, I didn't pay my fine. I didn't pay court costs. It doesn't say anything about the -- the driver's ability to drive safely. That's -- that's right, Justice -- And was there a way of finding out why the license was suspended? So two things.
One is this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence doesn't look to the underlying crime as to whether or not it's a socially appropriate or a wise policy choice that would justify the suspension.
Rather, this officer has an indication that Mr. Glover's license has been suspended and is incapable of lawfully operating a motor vehicle. But I'm asking about the technology of it.
Was there an easy way to push a button to say also that the registered owner's driver's license has been suspended because? So it's not in the record, but my understanding is the answer is no.
But even if there were, this law enforcement officer would not have the ability to say, you know, it's driving while suspended for failing to pay any number of tickets, I don't think I'm going to initiate the stop. Rather, this law enforcement officer knows that the registered owner is incapable of lawfully operating a motor vehicle.
And that gives sufficient suspicion in order to investigate further, much like the -- the conduct that was in Terry.
That may be perfectly lawful conduct, and maybe -- maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's a bad idea, but the officer at least has suspicion to generate additional inquiry. Do I -- and make sure I understand.
You -- you concede that if the officer acquires additional information in the course of the stop that suggests that his suspicion that this is the driver with the suspended license is not the driver in that instance, you would not be -- the officer would not be able to pursue the stop further? Yeah, I -- If, for example, it's -- it's, you know, Mr. So-and-So who's the registered owner and the woman -- it's a woman in -- driving the car, he would -- that would be the end of the matter, right? He would not be able to pursue the stop further? He would not be able to initiate the stop if information to the contrary had been present to him.
The archetypal situation is the looking for a 60-year-old man and it's a 22-year-old female.
So that would be -- that would dispel the reasonable suspicion that's under our -- We have dealt with that question on probable cause.
We've dealt with, if there is exculpatory material in the presence of probable cause, that a police officer is not required to take that into consideration. You're suggesting a different standard for reasonable suspicion? So I'm not sure I'm understanding you correctly. Under probable cause -- I think once -- -- if a defendant comes and gives you what seems to be a very reasonable explanation for why he did not commit this crime, we don't obligate police officers to investigate that reasonable explanation.
We say, probable cause exists, and the officer can arrest on probable cause. We're creating a different rule for reasonable cause? I -- I don't -- Under reasonable cause, you're prepared to say the rule is different.
If you have reason to believe it's not the driver, you shouldn't stop the car? I don't -- I don't believe so.
I believe our rule is the totality of the circumstances.
And as I understand the Chief Justice -- But there's only one totality. Well, so, in his hypothetical, the situation was, if the officer finds -- believes that they're searching for a 60-year-old man and is able to identify that the driver is a 20-year-old female, then the suspicion that initially attracted the officer to that vehicle would be dispelled.
That's just an application of the totality -- But -- but you -- -- of the circumstances. But -- -- but you say there is no necessity for the officer to make that check. Right.
So that's what this Court's cases have historically recognized, is once the existence of reasonable suspicion is there, then there is no necessity to investigate further, such as -- And the only basis for the reasonable suspicion is not a totality of the circumstance, it's one circumstance, the registered owner's driver's license has been suspended, period.
That's -- that's the only factor. What is the totality, in addition to -- So the totality depends on the particular crime that the officer is investigating.
I -- I concede to -- to the Court that the particular facts that the officer knew in this situation are frequently going to be determinative, but, rather, our rule permits the recognition that there could be situations that would come to the officer.
For example, if, again, it's a convertible and you're able to see the person, that suspicion is going to be dispelled. But what -- once the officer in -- in this situation has reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop, then -- But you say -- you say it's -- it would be happenstance that the officer was able to do this because the officer doesn't have to make any effort at all. Once he has -- once he knows that the registered owner's driver's license has been suspended, he doesn't have to do one more thing. He can -- he can do a Terry stop. So he can initiate the Terry stop to ask additional questions.
If in obtaining the license and registration or -- I'm sorry, the registration data behind the vehicle, he's capable -- he or she is capable of determining any characteristics of the driver, that's one thing. But, for example, if -- if the driver was expected to be a 60-year-old man and the officer was able to identify the driver and thinks, well, maybe it's a 58-year-old man, it may or may not be that individual, that suspicion is not dispelled, the stop would occur and the officer would approach the vehicle. Mr. Crouse, it seems to me -- General, are you -- I'm sorry. Please. It seems to me that a lot hinges on -- in your case on common sense assumption that the drivers of vehicles typically are the owners of the vehicle. Would you agree with that? I think that's -- yes. Yeah and -- and that might be true in our contemporary contingent historical reality, but the next generation, for example, often rents cars.
They don't -- they don't buy cars.
They don't own cars. You're asking us to write a rule for the Constitution that presumably has some duration to it.
Is this one with a short expiration date? So I don't think it is. I think it -- it would be part of the totality that could potentially come up.
I would envision a situation in which 20 or 40 or 60 years from now, maybe our operation of motor vehicles are different and under these same facts, perhaps there is no stipulation, perhaps the criminal defendant that has been stopped would like to cross-examine the officer and say, well, you know, in 2019, the registered owners were frequently the driver, but our -- our life has changed.
We've become the BRB -- or AirBnB of the society, and that would be able -- is something that the Court would then be able to consider.
But -- General, do you -- do you -- do you know the Florida v. Harris dog search case? You're familiar with that? What struck me in reading this case is that you're asking for a very different approach than we unanimously decided was proper in that case. So it's a probable cause case, but I don't think that much -- makes all that much difference.
The idea was that if you have a trained dog and it gives an alert, there's a reason to think that there's drugs in the car. And yet -- and yet unanimously we said, you know, but, at that suppression hearing, a person is entitled to say that's not all the circumstances that exist.
We know something about the dog's history.
We know something about the dog's training.
We know something about some other circumstance. And I think what you're asking us to do is essentially to say that all of those similar things in this context become irrelevant because we just have, as Justice Ginsburg said, this single circumstance, which is that a -- a non-registered owner is driving the car. Yeah.
So I actually think -- Right.
You've got it. Yeah, yeah.
I actually think that's helpful because it depends upon what the nature of the inquiry is.
Here, it's driving while suspended and the registered owner and the connection to the driver is common. With regard to a trained dog to sniff out particular drugs, I think there the dog actually alerted to a drug that it was not trained to identify. And so that does -- that's a more nuanced characterization than whether or not an individual is driving their vehicle because, for example, in -- oh, by the way, Mr. Glover could have cross-examined on a similar sort of circumstance.
Mr. Glover chose not to because the parties agreed what the facts were and they were tied to the particular crime of driving while suspended. Does it make a difference -- Justice Kagan pointed out that case was probable cause.
This is reasonable suspicion. Does the level of inquiry or examination vary depending upon whether it's probable cause or reasonable suspicion? Obviously, both Fourth Amendment, but the inquiry is much lower or the burden is much lower for an officer to justify a brief investigative decision -- The threshold is -- -- to confirm or dispel. -- the threshold is certainly lower. Yeah. But why would it be that we would, just because the threshold is lower, essentially throw out the totality of the circumstances analysis and simply say this one fact is enough? So we are not asking you to throw out the totality of the circumstance. You have to look at the particular crime that's -- that is implicated, whether it's in Florida versus Harris or -- or Nellis versus, I think, United States, those are relatively complicated crimes. I look at the Cortez case in which the number of inferences and deductions in order to identify Chevron as he -- he was scurrying people across the border, those are some significant inferences that depend upon an educated understanding of the law enforcement officer. I guess I'm just not seeing that.
I mean, the question in the dog alert case is, are there drugs in the car or are there not drugs in the car? And it's like, well, the dog alerted.
That's a awfully good reason to think there are drugs in the car.
But still we're going to go further and say that there are other things that might be involved in a particular case. Yes, briefly. Thank you, Your Honor. So I would say that the -- in this situation, the database alerted that Mr. Glover had a license that had been suspended and he couldn't operate the vehicle. We don't know why the dog alerted and we had to have information as to the officer's training and experience to answer that question. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fourth Amendment asks police officers to be reasonable.
It does not ask them to set aside common sense when they step into the patrol car. The traffic stop at issue in this case was constitutional because it was based on a common-sense inference.
It was reasonable for the officer to think that Charles Glover might be the person driving the truck registered in his name. That's an inference that police officers use all the time in a range of law enforcement situations as to -- But let's -- let's -- I'm sorry.
Please continue. (Laughter.) That's an inference that we commonly rely on in a range of law enforcement situations and the prevalence of the inference supports its reliability. Moreover, this Court has repeatedly explained that reasonable suspicion is a minimal standard.
It is significantly less than a preponderance of the evidence and less also than probable cause. The reason for that is that a traffic stop is much less intrusive than a custodial arrest, and the point of a traffic stop, just like every Terry stop, is simply to conduct further investigation. Justice Ginsburg, can I pick up your question? (Laughter.) The -- you say it's reasonable to infer that the owner is the driver, but it's a little less reasonable, is it not, when the owner's license has been suspended? I -- I think, Your Honor, it is maybe marginally less probable.
That's true.
But, again -- Because you're -- you're -- you're positing that most people who have had their license suspended will break the law? I -- I don't think we're positing that people will necessarily break the law, Your Honor.
In every case where you're conducting a Terry stop, you're going to have equivocal facts.
And the whole point of Terry is to provide a safe opportunity for the officer to conduct further investigation.
So -- But you just said, Mr. -- Mr. Huston, marginally less.
How do you know that, that it's only marginally less as opposed to significantly less? Your Honor, there -- we know that there are hundreds of thousands of citations in this country every year for driving on a suspended license.
I think the statistics that are pointed to, the study that's identified at page 41 of Respondent's own brief, talks about some of these statistics. We have other amici in this case that have offered the Court some of the statistics, about 7,000 fatalities involving unlicensed drivers.
It's not ultimately, at the end of the day, a detailed statistical question, as the Court has repeatedly explained in cases like Wardlow.
It turns on a common-sense judgment that the officer made. I guess what I'm trying to say is, what is that common-sense judgment based on? I mean, I understand that if -- this goes back to Justice Gorsuch's question -- if it were based on a particular officer's training and experience and judgment. But, here, we can't say that it's based on any of those things.
So what is it based on? Your Honor, I think we can -- I would respectfully dispute the idea that we can say it wasn't based on the officer's training and experience.
I do think that there are going to be a wide range of crimes where reasonable suspicion turns on only one fact. Think of a case like Berkemer.
The officer is driving, he sees a car swerving erratically, and he thinks that person might be drunk.
Now they might not, but I have reasonable suspicion to investigate further.
There's only one fact. I don't think we would say that the reasonableness of the stop in that case turned on whether the officer came into court and said, here's how often in my particular experience I've found that people who are swerving end up being drunk. I also think that dovetails with a wide variety of this Court's cases which have explained that we don't want the permissibility of a Fourth Amendment stop to turn on something that's unique to this particular officer, how he was trained at this particular time. The Court in Navarette did not think that the permissibility of that traffic stop turned on the particular testimony that the officer had given.
It said, instead, the Court said that -- You see, I thought it was the opposite, that we really do want particularistic inquiries here, whether the particularistic inquiry is related to the driver or the officer, that we want some way of saying there's reasonable suspicion in this case, not in -- I mean -- I mean, for example, would you just say -- suppose we just had a statistic that said, you know, that -- you know, that 30 percent of drivers are likely to do this. Would you say that, you know, that alone is enough, if it's just statistical? I'm just trying to find out like, what's the basis? Is the basis purely statistical? Is it something about a particular driver's experience and training? What is the basis? Your Honor is absolutely right that the suspicion has to be particular and objective.
That's the Court's formulation. But, when the Court has talked about particular, it means particular to this suspect, not particular to this officer.
Indeed, the Court has said, we don't want the availability of a traffic stop to turn on whether it's made by a junior officer versus a more experienced officer or something like that, but that the stop has to be particularized to the information that was known about this particular suspect. That's why I think, to answer Your Honor's question directly, a generalized statistic about how many people in the world commit a certain kind of offense will not generally be sufficient to establish -- Why not? -- a reasonable -- But getting to the particular person, doesn't that have to do with geography? Meaning I suspect there are some towns in the United States where people don't break the law no matter what, that it would be -- you know, if your license got suspended, the police officer knows that in this jurisdiction, that presumption is not a good one.
It doesn't work. It might work somewhere else, but without having the officer testify as to where he's doing this stop, we don't know. Absolutely. So you really are asking us to have one presumption based on no evidence -- I respectfully -- -- other than a stipulation that says that the driver of that license -- of that vehicle or that vehicle belongs to someone whose license has been suspended. Your Honor, we're asking the Court to hold that, as a general matter, as a matter of common sense and ordinary human experience, the owner of a driver is very often the vehicle -- the drive -- excuse me, the owner of the vehicle is very often the driver of that vehicle, in the absence of information to the contrary. So, in a circumstance in which, based on geography or other conditions of the area, there's a different standard and a reasonable officer would know -- That is a -- -- that -- Excuse me.
That is a generalized statistic then, though, that -- to point out what Justice Kagan was saying.
Are you relying on a generalized statistic? And you said no, but, in answering Justice Sotomayor, if I heard you correctly, you're basically saying, well, the common sense is based on this general idea that people are driving their own cars. My point to Justice Kagan was a generalized observation about how many people in the world commit a certain crime does not provide a basis for -- Well, let me give you a -- a hypothetical.
Suppose that a municipality has a law that says everybody has to carry their driver's license with them at all times.
And suppose that a particular police department actually did a kind of survey or, you know, a -- a -- a study of their practices and found that, actually, 50 percent of teenagers do not carry their driver's license with them at all times.
All right? So now it's like common sense that if you see a teenager, she won't be carrying her driver's license with her.
Does that -- does that give the police officer the ability to stop every teenager that he sees? Generally not, Your Honor.
I think the Court has said that that's what it means for the suspicion to be particularized to the individual.
You need a reason to pluck -- How -- -- this needle out of a haystack. -- how is that different -- how is that different from this case? Or, you know, you pull over a teenage driver because you suspect they're texting and there's statistics on that. It's -- it's -- So it's the same hypothetical as Justice Kagan's, but then distinguish that from this case. The difference, Your Honor, is that you need a reason -- you need -- the officer needs something that identifies the particularized suspicion that this driver is committing a crime. There is the particularized suspicion: Look, she's a teenager. I don't think -- unless that inference was so overwhelmingly reliable, it correlated so strongly, I guess at a certain point the inference becomes so overwhelming that there's a particular behavior that's so closely correlated with criminal activity that it would provide reasonable suspicion. So why isn't the requirement, as the Kansas court suggested, that you have to corroborate -- and I take that word very generally -- that you've just got to -- if you can safely, because no one's asking police officers to do things unsafely, okay -- but at least drive by and see if it's an older person, make sure it's not a woman, do something besides permitting one fact to drive a conclusion that's no different than a generalized statistic? Two responses to Your Honor.
First, it's actually not nearly as safe to do that as -- as one might suppose, as we explained in our brief.
Officers are trained instead to keep their vehicles positioned behind a suspect because that's the safest place for them to be. But even in a circumstance where everybody would say you could reasonably attempt that sort of in-vehicle pull-aside-and-peek maneuver, this Court has repeatedly -- Well, if you drive by.
Plenty of police officers that let someone they want to stop move forward from where they are and then pull in behind them.
There's a whole lot of things that could be done to do that. And if the officer does that, Your Honor, if the -- if the officer gains that type of information, that absolutely would be part of the totality of the circumstances, but I think this Court has explained, in Sokolow, that where an officer develops reasonable suspicion, a traffic stop is authorized and the permissibility of the stop does not depend on other less intrusive investigatory techniques that the officer might have pursued. You could make the same argument in any reasonable suspicion case.
Every defendant would come in and say there's always something that the officer could have easily done to investigate me further, short of making a traffic stop. The point of the reasonable suspicion standard is to be a minimal standard, because the purpose of reasonable suspicion is simply to conduct further investigation. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Kansas and the United States ask this Court to adopt a bright-line nationwide rule that it is always reasonable to assume that a car is being driven by its unlicensed owner. But, in three briefs and now 27 minutes of oral argument, they have offered literally no way for this Court to assess whether that is, in fact, a reasonable assumption, whether it is, in fact, based on common sense.
They disclaim reliance on the factual context.
They disclaim reliance on officers' experience.
They disclaim reliance on statistical evidence.
They simply assert that it is common sense in every circumstance and in every community in the country. But that's not true, and that's not how the Fourth Amendment works. Here, the only fact that would give rise to suspicion of illegal activity is the identity of the driver.
And it was Kansas's burden to establish that the officer had reason to suspect that Mr. Glover was driving. But the officer stipulated that, actually, he had no idea who was driving.
And the officer decided not to come in and testify at the suppression hearing to explain why he would assume that an unlicensed driver would be driving his car. Kansas should not be permitted now to make up for its evidentiary lapses by relying on a bright-line nationwide rule that has no basis in facts or in the circumstances of this case or in statistical evidence.
The Fourth Amendment requires a contextual analysis. This Court has repeatedly declined to adopt bright-line rules with respect to reasonable suspicion or probable cause.
And nothing about this case -- excuse me -- or this context would support departing from that ordinary contextual type of analysis. In an ordinary case, it would be relatively easy for an officer to establish reasonable suspicion that a car is or is not being driven by its unlicensed owner, but the officer and the state have to do at least that minimal amount of work before they can initiate the seizure. Here, Kansas didn't do that work, and so this Court should affirm.
I'm happy to take any questions. Ms. Harrington -- Yes. -- that last bit is what interests me, that it's a minimal burden that you would impose on the state.
And it does seem like in many of the cases on which the government relies, there's an officer who comes in and says, well, in my experience, owners drive their cars. And if that's all that is at issue here, is that Kansas forgot, neglected to put an officer on the stand to say, in my experience, the driver is usually the owner of the car or often is, what are we fighting about here? And is this -- what's really at stake? It seems to me that it's almost a formalism you're asking for this Court to endorse. So thank you for that question.
I think it's certainly not a formalism. So the first thing I would say is the question isn't whether an owner usually drives his car but whether an owner who doesn't have a valid license usually -- Fine. -- drives his car. Fine.
I amend my question and I pose it back to you. (Laughter.) Okay.
It's a very important distinction, though. The officer will now come in and say -- and recite -- I mean, we're just asking for a magic incantation of words. But -- but -- Instead of the one I proposed, it's the one you proposed. So maybe he will; maybe he won't, right? We don't know what the officer's experience is.
I mean, I think it's going to certainly -- Really? What if the officer -- if the officer in this case had said, I was trained that the -- that the driver of a car is usually the owner, even when the driver has a suspended license? So then there -- Would that be enough? It might be, but there would be opportunity for cross-examination about what the training is. Well, there was an opportunity here for -- for your client to put in any evidence that he wanted and to subpoena any witnesses he wanted.
Was there not? Certainly, Justice Alito, but it was Kansas's burden to make the evidentiary showing.
Kansas decided to stipulate, if you look at the hearing transcript on pages -- Yeah, but that's not responsive to my question.
If that was -- if that was done, if that's all you're asking for, would that be enough? The officer says, this is how I was trained. No.
I think you would need -- you'd need an opportunity for cross-examination.
You know, I think it's important -- And was there an opportunity for cross-examination here? There -- but there wasn't that -- if the officer had made that showing, had made that -- that factual assertion, then my client probably would have wanted to cross-examine.
But they didn't even do that.
They didn't rely on any officer experience. But if you could return -- It's not the defendant's job to -- Do you think -- -- to my question very briefly. Yes. Because I think it's antecedent to Justice Alito's.
If an officer comes in and says these magic words, whatever they are, right, and that's the sum total of evidence in the case, in my experience, in my training, whatever, is that good enough to satisfy the Constitution in your view? So it might be, but let me -- let me make just two points. Okay.
All right. That could -- that could be said in every single reasonable suspicion -- reasonable suspicion case, right? There's always something the officer can come in and say. But what -- the point of the suppression hearing is that you want to hear what the actual -- what the officer actually is going to say.
And I think it is certainly common sense to think that the rate at which suspended drivers continue to drive is going to vary from type of community to type of community. Well, let me try this again. And could you have asked the officer in this case just to finish your -- Sure. -- your line of questioning, it's mine too. Yeah.
Yeah. Could -- could the defendant in this case -- did he have the opportunity to ask those questions of the officer? Yes.
And I think if the -- if the state had chosen to rely on the officer's experience, then certainly we would have asked questions about that.
But the state chose not to rely on the officer's experience. And that's up to the state. If the state chooses to truncate its evidentiary showing, it's not up to the defendant to say, well, actually, maybe you should have put in evidence about this or that or the other thing, right? That's on the state. And it really is not a -- it's not a huge burden that the state has to do. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Harrington, do you -- do you think it's totally random who the driver is? In other words, it's registered to Fred Jones, but it could be anybody in the world? No. Okay.
Do you think it's -- the odds that it's Fred Jones are 5 percent? In other words, there could be -- out of 100 people, there could be 95 people that you don't know driving the car registered to Fred Jones, but there's a 5 percent chance that it's him? Are you asking if I think that's enough for reasonable suspicion? No, I'm asking you if you think that, whether it's reasonable suspicion or not, do you think it is at least a 5 percent chance that it's Fred Jones? That the owner is driving? That the owner of the car is driving the car. On a suspended license or just in general? Just in general. So, yes, in general. Okay.
And where are you going to stop? Surely one out of ten, it's Fred Jones's car.
It's being driven. And when the officer goes up, he sees that it's -- it's -- it's whatever Fred Jones is, a middle-aged man and not a teenage girl.
Is -- is it still like -- is it maybe one out of ten chances? I don't -- I mean, I don't know what it is.
And it's not -- You really don't know? You don't think it's one out of ten? I think it is probably one out of ten that an owner with a valid license is driving his car. Okay.
Well, we know that probable cause is not 50 percent. Right. It's somewhat less than 50 percent. Yes. And even you are willing to agree that it's at least 10 percent. Yes. Well, what -- what reasonable suspicion cutoff do you think? Do you think it's one out of five? I can't say because this Court has said repeatedly that -- No, but you -- -- none of us can say, right? No, the point is most of us can say.
And the reason is because reasonable suspicion does not have to be based on statistics, it does not have to be based on specialized experience.
As we've said often, it can be based on common sense. And I'm sure that the number varies. I'm sure if you're in a neighborhood that -- that has a lot of, you know, kids who will drive their parents' car, that's fine.
And if it's an area where you don't, that's fine. But reasonable suspicion doesn't depend upon the kind of showing that you seem to demand, whether it's a statistical study or special experience. Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not saying that the state has to put in any particular type of evidence.
But, if they're just relying on an assertion of common sense, they have to give us some way to assess whether that is a reasonable common-sense inference. They don't -- I was just going to say if they're relying on common sense, they don't have to give you anything more than common sense. But how do we know if it is common sense? I mean, I think your -- All we're saying -- I already got you to 10 percent. But that's in people -- that's about owners who have valid licenses. I think it's -- I think it is not at all common sense.
It's the opposite of common sense to think that someone having a suspended or revoked license is going to have no effect at all on whether they drive. I think the -- the inference cuts the other way.
We know somebody's already broken the law in some sense; he's got a suspended license. Well, we -- I think it's probably more likely than not that he would break the law saying you can't drive with a suspended license. So, first, you know, the facts on the ground suggest that we don't know that, because, in many states, it's -- it's the inability to pay fines that results in a suspended license, not criminal activities. But, second, this Court has never ever held or come close to holding that evidence that you committed X crime is enough for us -- But this isn't -- this is collateral to your basic proposition. Your basic proposition is that it doesn't rise to the level of reasonable suspicion to think that a car registered in Fred Jones' name is being driven by Fred Jones. That's different than the collateral point about whether he's more or less likely because the license is suspended. No, that's not true. Our -- our basic proposition is it's not a reasonable inference when Fred Jones does not have a valid license, right? And it's not reasonable to think that the -- that the statistics or the rate of driving on a suspended license are going to be the same in every community in the country. If someone lives in Manhattan or Chicago or downtown D.C. and has a suspended license, I think it's significantly less likely that they're going to drive on a suspended license because they have access to public transportation and Uber and all these things to get to the places they needed to go, compared to someone who lives in, say, rural North Dakota or some other place where there isn't public transportation. In your -- in your opening, you said it would be relatively easy for the police to establish whether the driver is the owner.
What are you basing that on? Well, to establish a reasonable suspicion.
I mean, there are a lot of things that they can do.
So, first of all, an officer could come in, as I said, and testify and say, well, you know, in my experience, nine times out of ten, when this kind of hit comes up on the computer, it ends up being the suspended owner who is driving the car. An officer could say the information that came up on the computer was that this person had previously been caught driving on a suspended license.
That's what -- Can I go back for a second -- And there's others. -- to the Chief Justice's question -- Finish. -- because I had exactly the same reaction, and I'd like to finish with that or just a step further. Look, I go outside.
We go outside. There's a car driving.
We happen to know the license plate, and the license plate tells us that Charles Smith owns the car.
We see a friend.
He says: I reasonably suspect that it's Charles Jones driving that car. Would you say the friend is wrong to reasonably suspect that Charles is driving the car? No, unless you have some reason -- The answer is no. Unless it's legal. Now we add another fact.
I would like to tell you a fact on my side this time.
The State told you the other fact.
I'm telling you this one. His license was suspended.
Now he says, you know, that's a good point, but I still reasonably suspect he's driving.
Now would you say that now that person is wrong? Yes, you would. Well, but -- But you're asking me to say -- -- I would have questions for that person. -- that that person is -- a question, but the question you're asking me to say that that person who still suspects that Charles is driving is unreasonable.
That's pretty tough for me to say.
It's pretty tough for me to say that that person's wrong, unreasonable, when he still suspects it. Now there we are.
And I can't get any further in this case.
Now it may be that you have found some precedent that shows that this initial reaction, which I'm showing you, is totally wrong, and I'd like to know what it is because I'll go read it. Well, I'll point to basically all of this Court's Fourth Amendment cases, which say you have to look at the totality of circumstances. We just did. And you can't just -- no, you can't just assume illegal activity based on one -- I'm not assuming -- -- isolated fact. -- illegal activity. You are if you -- It happens to be -- -- think that he has a suspended license -- Oh, yeah, it happens to be.
All I'm assuming is a fact.
All I want to know is a fact: Is Charles driving the car? Right.
So I would point -- It's different from the teenage case. Justice Breyer, I would point you to the Brignoni-Ponce and Brown versus Texas as two good examples. What -- say it again. United States versus Brignoni-Ponce.
I won't try to spell it here, but it's in the briefs.
And Brown versus Texas. Those are two cases where this Court has said you can't do, basically, what you're saying. In Brown versus Texas, there was someone in an alley walking away from another person in a high-crime area, and the officer stopped him and -- and -- you know, in -- did a Terry stop basically.
And the Court said it's not enough that he was present in a high-crime area where the probability that he was doing something illegal was higher than if he had been somewhere else. Not enough.
You need something else. And there's a footnote saying including just the officer's explaining why, in his experience -- So what is the -- -- the presence there -- -- something else? You're referring to experience and you're making a distinction between the rookie cop and the one who's on the beat for a long time.
And -- Right.
So maybe you know something more about the driver's history. It could come up that, you know, the -- Mr. Glover was charged in this case with being a habitual offender.
One way to be a habitual offender is to have been convicted three times of driving on a suspended license. I -- but -- If that's something the officer knew -- I -- I asked -- I think I asked the question whether there's an easy way to find out what was the reason for the suspension, and the -- the answer to that question was no. For Kansas.
For this county at least.
But at -- that's probably going to vary from community to community.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Well, tell me how you think the police can safely verify that the -- their suspicion that the owner is the driver is accurate? So, as I said, you can do things short of verifying it, right? You can rely on your experience.
If this hit comes up and nine times out of ten it's always the suspended owner who's driving, if you know something specific, that this person has previously been caught driving on a suspended license. But also, you know, this stop happened in a sort of -- in an area where there were multiple lanes of traffic in every direction. There was a stoplight at the corner.
It would not have been dangerous or difficult for the officer to pull alongside the car and take a -- take a glance and see is this an -- Do you have -- -- African-American man. -- statistics to support that proposition? I don't. That it wouldn't have been hard for the officer to pull up next to the car and look over? I do not, no, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice.
But that is certainly part of what officers do.
You know, they examine the circumstances and the factual surroundings.
I have noticed, since taking on this case just driving around, how easy is it or difficult is it to see the -- the face of a driver in front of me, just by looking in the mirror -- side-view mirror or the rear-view mirror, and there are certainly circumstances where you can do it and it's not difficult. Let's say then -- But if he peers into the window and his glass is -- is tinted and he can't see, so you -- you're saying if -- if he -- he has to -- in that case, he can't make the stop; he lets -- he has to let the -- the driver go on? Unless he can rely on one of the other several things I've mentioned, like his experience with these types of -- I -- I mentioned one of the problems with experience, that you're making a distinction between the rookie cop who doesn't have any experience and the veteran. But that's going to be true in every Fourth Amendment context, right, where -- where you're relying on officers' experience.
If they have no experience, it's going to be harder for them to justify their reasonable suspicion. What about the manual that says stay behind the car that you suspect? So, if such a manual exists -- and it's not in the record -- you know, then -- then you would need to rely on one of the other methods of establishing reasonable suspicion.
One thing officers often testify about is how the person that they're suspecting reacted to the officer's presence.
And so, if suddenly the car slowed down in a way that seemed suspicious or took a sudden turn, that could be a factor in -- you know, a tile in the mosaic of circumstances that would be relevant. You -- you want the officer, therefore, to follow the driver, and your brief suggests this, until they make a lane change or until they go too quickly on the right turn on red or don't come to a full stop. What sense does that rule make? So I think that's -- that's one option.
And this Court said -- That's an option you articulate in the brief, and -- Yeah. -- I'm trying to figure out what -- what purpose that would serve.
Just, okay, instead of stopping right away, I'm going to -- I'm going to follow you until you go 31 in the 30, and then I'm going to immediately pull you over. Well, you would follow him until you had probable cause of some traffic violation.
And this Court said in Delaware versus Prouse that that is the way that these laws about licensing and registration are generally enforced. But if I -- Let's say an officer -- -- understand you correctly, Ms. Harrington, you don't really require that anybody be followed until they do something wrong, and you don't really require that a police officer goes and checks out who's sitting in the front seat. A police officer could do neither of those things. Right. As long as the police officer shows up to the suppression hearing and says ""I based this on my training and my experience"" and subjects himself to some form of cross-examination. Just like the usual way, right. How -- how much -- That would be enough -- We talked about before -- -- wouldn't it? -- experience -- how much experience does he have to have? How many times does he have to stop a car because he thinks -- well, I guess he can do it -- how does he get experience if he can't do it the first time? Well, he -- I mean, if he has some other basis to do it or, you know, he's -- he's driving with someone.
I don't know.
I -- I mean, it's just like the dog, right? Right. It's like, you know, somebody certifies me, somebody trains me, I've seen this done by my partner, I've heard about it being done by other people in my department. It's just you subject yourself to something, which is the point of suppression hearings, isn't it? Right.
I mean, this Court's held in Ornelas versus United States that courts should defer to the reasonable community-based experience not only of law enforcement officers but also of trial judges. Here, we did not -- That was a probable cause case, right? Probable cause, although still less than 50 percent -- Yes. -- is significantly more than reasonable suspicion. That's absolutely -- So it -- -- true. -- may be the case that you don't need a -- the same level of training and experience and background to make the -- make the assumption that you've already said is at least 10 percent. You may need less, but you -- but the type of analysis you would go through to determine if there is reasonable suspicion, there's no reason that it would be different than in a probable cause case. Let's say -- But in -- -- a police officer pulls up behind a car after having -- is behind the car after having obtained information that the registered owner of the car has a suspended license. What are all of the considerations that you think the officer has to take into account before initiating a stop? Checking -- trying to check with headquarters as to the basis for the license suspension? Whether it's an urban area or a rural area or someplace in between? Whether it's a highway or a city street? Whether it's raining? Whether it's dark? Maybe whether it's a law-abiding community where people who have suspended licenses never drive? He -- the officer has to take into account all of those factors before initiating a stop? Not necessarily.
He just has to take into account the full sort of factual context and -- making a judgment about whether he has reason to suspect that the owner is, in fact, driving the car.
And -- After having done that and when there is a motion to suppress, the -- the -- the judge has to take into account all of those factors? Well, it wasn't really a rural area or a city; it was sort -- sort of in between, and it was raining, but it wasn't raining hard? All those things would depend on an -- an -- an evaluation of all of those factors? Just like in any Fourth Amendment case, Justice Alito, that you have to look at the full factual context.
And, here, we did not hear from the local law enforcement officer at the suppression hearing. We did hear from the local trial judge, and she said, in her experience, based on her life in the community of Lawrence, Kansas, this was not a reasonable assumption.
And Ornelas said you should defer to that just as much as you should defer to the officer's experience. Is it -- is it your argument that reasonable suspicion can never be based on a single fact, on just one fact? There always has to be more than one fact? Not necessarily.
It depends on what the fact is.
If a fact is inherently suspicious, if you -- if you see someone running out of a bank with an alarm going off wearing a ski mask, that's probably enough to raise reasonable suspicion. How about -- how about a swerving car? So a swerving car, it would depend on the -- on the situation.
In Navarette, it wasn't just the -- the car was swerving -- So sometimes yes? Sometimes yes.
So, in Navarette, the car was -- had run another car off the road.
And this car -- this -- this Court did cite studies about sort of the observable behavior of people who were driving -- Then, on the question Justice Kagan followed up with you on, saying that you weren't really arguing that the officer had to do more to follow the driver, on page 35 and 36 of your brief, you specifically say that. We say the officer can do that.
That's one of the things officers can -- we're not trying to say -- so we're not asking for a bright-line rule in our direction here. You -- you said there that it's relatively easy for an officer to do this by tracking the driver until the driver does some minor traffic violation, and then you can pull the -- the driver over. Which is what this Court has said in Delaware versus Prouse. That's the ordinary way of enforcing these types of laws, but I think -- However, Delaware, that case did not involve someone with a suspended license. They were looking for people who had -- who were unlicensed.
And -- That's what they were looking for, but they didn't have information that the owner of the car in question had a suspended license. They didn't, no.
My point is -- That was the whole point.
In fact, the last paragraph or page of the opinion specifically distinguishes that situation. Yes, Justice Kavanaugh, that's absolutely true.
My point is only that the Court said that that is just the ordinary way that you enforce these laws, and so there's nothing extraordinary about my saying that's one option. When -- when I'm talking in the brief about how it is relatively easy for officers to do this, what I'm saying is there's no reason to depart from the ordinary Fourth Amendment contextual analysis to adopt a bright-line rule. There's no special safety justifications -- I'm just trying to figure out why -- what sense that makes.
And I don't want to dwell too long on this but you made a point of it in the brief of, yeah, the officer should just follow them around until they do something wrong on the traffic laws. And do you think that really is a sufficient basis to stop someone in this exact circumstance, if they had gone another mile down the road -- I think -- -- it would have been fine because he -- Sorry. -- swerved or had just barely exceeded the speed limit? Well, I think that the officer has no other basis for having a reasonable suspicion, that the suspended owner is, in fact, driving, but they kind of have a hunch and they want to follow up on the hunch, then they can just follow the person until that -- You're encouraging pretextual stops. No, it's not pretextual if they see something that raises probable cause for some other violation.
This Court has said that's fine.
It doesn't matter what the subjective motivation was.
If they see something that objectively creates probable cause to make a traffic stop, they can do that. And you mentioned -- you mentioned peering into the window, that that's something that could be done. In some cases, yes. I mean, so our point is just there's a whole number of -- I hope I didn't interrupt you if you have more to your question. There's a whole number of things an officer can do to -- you know, to do more than just say I'm just assuming that the unlicensed owner is driving the car. But it does seem -- I think the word formal was used, after this case, suppose you're right.
And that every case what happens is that the police officer goes to the hearing, testifies either, my manual said stay behind the car or, in my experience when I've done stops, it's the registered owner who's the driver.
That would be -- that that's okay. That would probably be fine.
And I say probably only because this Court has said we don't adopt bright-line rules, so I don't want to give sort of absolutist answers -- Well, if that's -- Well, he doesn't -- -- the case -- I'm sorry, Chief. I'm just -- he doesn't have to say that in his experience the registered owner is the driver, right? He just has to hit one out of ten times, or two out of ten. Maybe.
I mean -- In my experience, you know, I've done ten of these and twice it was the driver.
And that -- That might be enough. -- that strikes me as the right number for reasonable suspicion. It might be enough. This Court has never put a number on it.
It has said a number of times it can't put a number on it, and so I can't put a number on it.
But that might be enough.
It might not be enough, you know. Well, if -- if it is and if your answer to Justice Ginsburg is correct that all an officer has to say is, in my training or experience, one out of 10, one out of 20, it's -- it's been the driver who is the owner of an unregistered car -- Unlicensed owner of a registered car, yeah. Unlicensed, yeah, right.
Then -- then why is it -- why shouldn't we read the declaration here as effectively saying that, that I assume? I'm an officer. This is what I do. Right. I assume this is the driver, okay? This is Kansas, not New York. This is the owner, okay? (Laughter.) Touche. Why -- why isn't that a fair reading, though, of the declaration before us and then it becomes incumbent upon the defendant, if the defendant wishes to raise questions, just as a defendant might about the dog's training and sniffing abilities and record with different substances, to raise some questions about the officer's training and experience or locality, circumstances in Lawrence, which is a very law-abiding community. I'm sure. Or whatever.
Why -- why shouldn't we read this as effectively exactly what you say would be sufficient? I think the simple answer is because it isn't.
That isn't what it says.
It just said he assumed that -- I understand literally, counsel -- -- the owner was the driver. -- it says -- it's a different formulation of words, but why isn't it functionally? Why isn't it practically? Why isn't it really exactly what we're talking about? Because it's -- it doesn't say I assume that an unlicensed owner is the driver.
It just says, I assume an owner is a driver. So it's all -- That's not -- -- magic words. The relevant question. It's just -- It's not magic words. You just have -- it's -- it's -- like I said, it's not going very hard in most cases, but the -- the state -- Ms. Harrington -- -- has to do the work. -- I read the lower court, the supreme court, Kansas Supreme Court's words literally.
It said, when a court draws inferences in favor of the state based on a lack of evidence in the record, it impermissibly relieves the state of its burden. Right. And very carefully it says, here, the problem is not that the state necessarily needs significantly more evidence, it needs some more evidence. Right.
I think that's -- that has to be true.
And -- and the Kansas Supreme Court said, I'm not even going to try to list all the different ways you could do it because there are so many, but you have to just do something.
And that's sort of all that what we're asking for. That is what this Court has said time and time again in its Fourth Amendment cases, that you have to look at the totality of circumstances.
You can't just rely on a single sort of -- single fact that has a probability-based correlation, maybe, to a crime. You have to come in and explain the basis for your suspicion.
My friend, Mr. Crouse, talked about Terry, but Terry did not adopt a bright-line rule that anytime someone walks past a store window three times, you automatically have reasonable suspicion, right? They relied on the officer's experience, his observations of other things that were going on.
That's all we're saying in this case you should do, just rely on other -- other things that were observed, other things the officer knew.
Maybe in his experience, the database is extremely unreliable, but that would be something that's relevant to know. Maybe in his experience it's extremely reliable also would be relevant to know.
You just need something more. Do you think in Terry they needed statistics about the percentage of people who walked by a window three times who have some criminal intent? No.
But, in Terry, there wasn't a sort of probability-based suspicion.
But also, I want -- I want to be clear.
We don't think the state needs statistics.
Kansas relied on statistics in its opening brief to this Court.
We think they were bad statistics, and its amici statistics were bad statistics.
They are not relevant to the central question in this case. And so our point in our brief in discussing the statistics is at least you have to rely on good statistics, right? So what's -- you said something, it certainly caught my attention.
I thought the officer was probably saying the right thing, in my experience, people who own cars are likely to be the drivers. It -- End of the matter, until you point out, not them, you point out that here the driver had lost his license.
Now it becomes more difficult.
But you keep saying not a bright-line rule.
I don't think there's a bright-line rule.
I don't see that. You want to add other things.
What other things? And if there were other things that were relevant to this, why not call the officer -- Because it -- -- and ask him about them? Because it's -- And if you want to say no, that's unreasonable given my fact, given my fact, you probably didn't say that because, actually, the statistics show 75 percent, you know, 60 percent, but not here, dah-dah-dah. Okay, we're into that. So -- But what is it -- what is it that you think is that extra thing in the facts here that should have been in? I mean, I've listed like ten things he could have done and he didn't do any of them, but -- I didn't say that.
I said, what is it? I'm not talking about what he might have done. Yeah. I'm saying, what fact is there other than the two he pointed to and the one you added that you think was relevant? So the -- the drive -- the behavior of the driver could have been relevant.
It could have been relevant whether Mr. -- No, I'm not asking could have been. Well, I don't -- I don't know because they didn't come forward. Oh, all right.
So -- It's the state's burden to -- -- your point is -- -- put forward the evidence. -- you should decide all the facts, but I can't point you to a fact that wasn't -- that was relevant and wasn't decided.
I mean -- Well, how about -- -- you say they shouldn't just do -- How about his experience and training? Yeah.
I mean, he could have testified about his experience and training.
Maybe in his experience, you know, nine times out of ten or 99 times out of 100 when you pull someone over in this circumstance, it's not the unlicensed owner who's driving the car.
We just don't know, right? They need to come in -- under the rule Kansas wants, anytime someone borrows a car that's registered to an unlicensed owner, there's literally nothing she could do to avoid being seized, right? If you adopt this bright-line rule, there's nothing she could do to avoid being seized.
That has to be evidence, strong evidence, that the rule is overly broad. And what you are proposing is either a trivial decision or a revolutionary decision.
It's a trivial decision if all that's lacking here is a statement, I've been trained that, blah, blah, blah. It's a revolutionary decision if in every case involving reasonable suspicion there has to be a statistical showing or an examination of all the things that you think are necessary here. Is that not right? May I answer? Sure. Justice Alito, what we're asking for is that the ordinary Fourth Amendment contextual analysis be required in every case.
It doesn't require statistics in every case.
It doesn't require any magic words. It just requires something to support the reasonableness of an assumption. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, General Crouse. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'd like to first start with regard to the officer's training and experience and the lack of testimony. The reason that isn't in this case is because Mr. Glover stipulated to the facts below and failed to raise any question as to the officer's training and experience until the red brief in this Court.
See page 4 of our reply brief. But wait a minute. Whose burden is it? Isn't it yours? You have to prove the facts. We have proved the stipulated facts. Well, you proved -- They didn't challenge those facts. -- that fact, but they don't have to if you don't prove enough. So they didn't -- They could -- they could -- you could come in and say he wore a red hat, that's why I stopped him, and they would come back and say, that's not enough to make out reasonable suspicion. So, if what they're saying is making an assumption without telling us what the basis of that assumption is, is not enough. So the point is they stipulated to the facts that were relevant to the determination, and the Kansas Supreme Court made a determination as to those facts. My point is that didn't arise until the red brief in this Court.
And so we don't think it's fair to criticize once they've agreed.
If they wanted to indicate as to what the statistics were, they had an opportunity to call that officer and cross-examine him. Second, with regard to waiting for a violation, as Justice Kavanaugh talked about, we think that's a perfectly reasonable situation if we're going to eliminate reasonable suspicion. Rather, if there's a traffic violation, that's probable cause for a stop and that's not a basis.
This Court's decision has indicated that you don't have to wait for probable cause in order to initiate a stop.
And so I think your question was right on. Third, statistics.
We agree with the red brief that indicates that statistics are rarely present and frequently are going to be distinguished by the parties.
And so we don't believe that statistics are relevant. Fourth, we also believe that -- May I go back to the stipulation? You said it's -- Kansas drew the stipulation, right? The parties drew the stipulation, agreed to them, and presented them to the court. So it was a joint stipulation? The parties stipulated, yes, Your Honor. The fourth point I would like to make is that the Fourth Amendment does not and should not apply differently based upon the age and experience of the officer or the time of day of the Fourth Amendment. The rule that Respondents propose would require the officers to let this vehicle go at night because it's impossible to identify. This Court's cases, except for, I believe, a no knock warrant, does not do that.
Certainly, the reasonable suspicion cases do not do that. And, fifth, the states have a strong interest in regulating the roadways of the traffic situation here, and they have a strong law enforcement interest. For example, if there's a report of a -- a child that had been -- You can finish your thought. Thank you.
A child that had been abducted, and we were looking for the mother, the officers would be reasonable to rely upon the license plate. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1059, Kelly versus United States. Mr. Roth. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Once again, the government is trying to use the open-ended federal fraud statutes to enforce honest government at the state and local levels.
Its theory this time is that the defendants committed property fraud by reallocating two traffic lanes from one public road to another without disclosing their real political reason for doing so. This theory turns the integrity of every official action at every level of government into a potential federal fraud investigation.
It end-runs McNally and Skilling by subsuming honest services fraud within property fraud and by criminalizing ulterior motives even without bribes or kickbacks.
It would effect a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction into a particularly fraught area. This is not the law.
This Court in Cleveland held that regulatory authority is not property.
So an official who induces a sovereign decision through deceit has not obtained property by fraud.
Only when the official lies to divert state resources to private use has he stepped outside the regulatory realm and committed property fraud. This rule distinguishes property fraud from honest services fraud and from routine political conduct. Here, because the defendants simply reallocated the traffic lanes from one public use to another, the Port Authority at most was deprived of regulatory control, not property. And that's true regardless of whether, as the government now alleges, the defendants lacked the authority in some sense to order the realignment. Mr. Levy will explain why the government is wrong to say that, but it's ultimately legally irrelevant because the fraud statutes do not prohibit lying to take unauthorized state action.
They prohibit lying to obtain property.
And that simply is not what occurred in this case. You've said that if the resources were diverted to private use, then the prosecution would be okay.
But why isn't it a private use to benefit defendants politically? Your Honor, I'm trying to distinguish the use of the property from the motive for the decision.
So here the decision was to realign the lanes from one set of public drivers to another set of public drivers.
Both are public uses of the lanes. Now, it's true the motive, the alleged motive, for that regulatory decision was improper.
It was political, right? That's the allegation in the case.
But that doesn't mean that -- that it's -- that the use of the lanes was private.
It's not -- Your Honor, the typical case in which the government has prosecuted property fraud against a public official is where the official lies to take property from the government for his own use. So a situation where you lie on your expense report, you say you incurred this expense for business reasons and you did not. In that situation, you're lying and you're taking the property out -- away from the government for yourself.
That is obtaining property. Here, what the defendants influenced through their deceit was the decision about the alignment of the lanes.
And if there's anything that is regulatory in nature -- So, Mr. Roth, on -- on that theory, would it or would it not make a difference if the defendants here, rather than doing everything that they did for a political reason, if they had done it to make their commutes easier or their families' commutes easier, so it wasn't anything about politics, it was their own personal interests, but they did exactly the same things, is that covered or is not -- is that not covered on your theory? That, on -- on my theory, that is certainly not property fraud.
The officials even in that case have not obtained property by fraud. So you're not making just a distinction between private uses and public uses? You know, private purposes and -- and public purposes, maybe? I'm certainly not making a distinction between the type of purpose.
What I am trying to distinguish is the use of the property and is it a regulatory decision to realign the lanes for whatever purpose? Because if we're -- if what we're concerned about is the integrity of the purpose behind the decision, that really sounds in honest services fraud, right? Because what we're concerned about is not the government being cheated out of property that it has or that it owns; what we're concerned about is the good faith of the official in making the decision.
Was he -- That's a hard -- can be a hard line to draw.
I mean, if -- if the rerouting of the traffic is done for commercial benefit of the individual in whatever way, that would be a violation, right? Your Honor, if it would -- He has got a -- a -- you know, a development or something, he's building a hotel in -- in Fort Lee, and he wants the traffic redirected there or directed away from, whichever, because he thinks it will increase business at his hotel. Your Honor, if the Court were to -- to consider that as a kickback, then that would be honest services fraud.
It would not be property fraud, because, again, the decision there is a -- is a decision about allocating scarce public resources among public uses. Again, the concern in Your Honor's hypothetical is, well, what -- was it a good reason? Was it to benefit the public or was it to benefit himself? And what this Court said in Skilling is, if you make the decision because you were paid a bribe or because you were going to be getting a kickback, that is a violation of your honest services -- your duty to provide honest services to the public. What we're doing here is interpreting a statute.
And it's not quite clear to me how your argument fits into the language of this statute. So property -- money is property.
And money was lost.
So how does this fit into the language of the mail fraud statute -- the wire fraud statute? So, Your Honor is correct, the relevant word is ""property"" and the second relevant word is ""obtain."" And this Court in Cleveland explained that when the government is making sovereign decisions in its capacity as sovereign, implicating its regulatory interests, that is not property within the meaning that Congress had when it enacted -- Was there a loss of money in -- in Cleveland? Well, there wasn't -- it's not clear if there was lost property.
Certainly I would say there was an official in that case who was processing the fraudulent application. And if he had not been given the fraudulent application to process, he would have been doing useful work for the agency. And maybe he would have gone home an hour earlier and been paid a little bit less.
I don't think any of that would have mattered to the result in Cleveland because it's -- all of that -- But still, how does it fit in the statute? Is it that there isn't -- property isn't obtained when it is simply wasted? Is it that -- does it -- is it a gloss on the word ""defraud""? I -- I think it's two steps, Your Honor.
The first step is to establish that the decision, the realignment, is not property because that's control.
That is regulatory power. The second step is to say: Well then what about the costs of implementing it? And I would say the costs of implementing it -- of implementing that regulatory decision are part and parcel of it and it's -- the scheme is not to obtain that property. The purpose of the -- the scheme, the object of the scheme, is to effect this policy decision, this regulatory decision, in the way that the officials want. So in the case of sending city snowplows to -- to -- to clear your own house first or sending city maintenance people to paint your own house, if you're a public official, I was under the impression that you thought that that would be a crime. Is that right? If -- if the -- if you're sending the public employees to do private work, yes, absolutely.
That's not regulatory.
At that point you're just taking the city property and using it for private use, which is not -- that's -- that's -- you're obtaining the property. I would distinguish -- So even though -- -- that, though -- -- both are diversions of city resources or state resources, whatever it is, it's just one is regulatory and one is not because one involves personal benefit? Personal use.
Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, every -- every regulatory decision diverts resources in some way.
I mean, every time a public official makes a decision, there are implications for the bureaucracy and there are implications for public property. So there is diversion going on and maybe the decision was made for a bad reason and if it's a bad enough reason, maybe it's an honest services violation. Is your theory that the word ""obtain"" is what does the work in response to Justice Kagan's hypothetical? I think it's ""obtaining property"" together.
I don't necessarily think it's one or the other.
Cleveland focused on property and what did Congress mean when it said ""property."" I think it said, we are concerned with cheating people out of their property rights. And you can do that with a government entity.
You can certainly cheat the government out of its property, Pasquantino is the example of that where the Court said, you owe tax -- you owe taxes to the government, you lied to avoid paying your taxes, you've committed property fraud.
The same, by the way, could occur in a Port Authority situation. You owe a toll and you lie to evade paying the toll, you have cheated the government out of property that it's owed.
But if what you're doing is making a regulatory decision like allocating public resources among public uses, and there's no question that the main line is a public use, just as much as the special access roads are a public use of the property, that is not obtaining property. I can understand the distinction between a regulatory decision and the deprivation of property when the regulation -- when the regulatory decision doesn't cause a loss of property, but when the regulatory decision cause a loss of property, I -- I find it more difficult to see the distinction. Well, Your Honor -- Explain it to me. Your Honor, I think that every regulatory decision is going to have some consequences for public employee -- employee time, for example, which is the species of property that the government has invoked. But in this case -- let's take this case, just as an example.
What they focus on -- the additional money that was spent was the toll keeper.
The toll keeper had to do an additional shift.
But the toll keeper was doing her job of collecting tolls for the public. So the Port Authority was not deprived of her salary.
She was earning her salary. The -- the objection is, if this regulatory decision had not been made, we would not have had to hire that toll keeper for that work. Right.
Well, I'll try this one last time.
Tell me how this fits in -- when we write the opinion, if we were to write one in your favor, how would we explain your result within the language of the statute? I think the Court would say the statute prohibits schemes to obtain property when you are using deceit to influence a regulatory decision, to change a regulatory decision, that is not obtaining property, and, in the corollary, that's important, is the costs of implementing a regulatory decision don't change the result. I think I'll try mine once more too, Mr. Roth.
Why when a public official says you -- to a city maintenance worker, you should paint my house before you do anything else, why isn't that similarly an allocation of resources? Because it's not the job -- I mean -- -- of government -- -- it benefits me -- Right, but -- -- but, you know, I -- I get to send, whether it's painting or snowplows, you know, you -- you -- you go plow my street first. Right. Why isn't that an allocation -- So, so -- -- of city resources? Let me try to clarify because I think I may be -- I may have led to some confusion.
If you're plowing public road, and you say I want to plow my street first or my neighborhood first, that is not obtaining property by fraud because that is an allocation of resources to a public use.
It's a public use that happens to benefit you and maybe that was your motive and that's very bad, but it's not obtaining property by fraud. If you instead trick the public employees not into plowing the public road but into plowing your private drive -- driveway, which is not the job of the government, right, that's not what the government does, the government is concerned with public property and clearing public property. If you trick the -- the employees into plowing your private driveway, then you have taken their services for your personal use, which is fundamentally different.
That's no different from saying, I worked overtime when you didn't.
Please pay me, you know, my hourly wage for the hour time that I didn't work. And that difference is, just to go back to Justice Alito's question, where in the statute? The difference is in the scheme to obtain property.
That's -- that's where it is in the statute.
And so you look at what is the object of the scheme. And if the object of the scheme is to influence a regulatory decision, it's not a scheme to obtain property under -- that's -- just follows from Cleveland.
Otherwise every decision that public official makes is on the table and the only thing that is separated -- I'm sorry, I thought the scheme was to make life difficult for Fort Lee.
If that was the scheme, and you defrauded the use of government property to accomplish your goal, why is that any different than taking the maintenance worker to plow your road, your private street? Your Honor, the difference is that here the alleged purpose, the alleged motive was what Your Honor said, right, to increase traffic -- That was the scheme. Yeah.
The scheme was to do that through a regulatory decision, right, by realigning the lanes from one public use to another public use. So what we're -- what the objection is to the conduct here is an objection to the purpose, not the objective use of the property. That's the difference. My -- my problem is, it's -- I don't think -- I can see a headline that would say it's okay for officials to use government public money in a way that is plainly unauthorized, not just in its motives but it's in end use, and an official can and should not be -- should never be liable for that.
Our public officials now can use government resources -- Your -- Your -- -- for their private ends. -- Honor -- right.
But, Your Honor, all -- all -- Not mixed motive, which is the interesting question here with the traffic study and whether you have enough -- whether they have enough evidence that there wasn't a traffic study, but you're saying when it was -- and what the government has said, you're not authorized to do it, there's a question about that. Yeah. And you didn't have even a mixed motive.
You had only a personal motive. So, Your Honor, I'll let Mr. Levy speak a little bit more at length about unauthorized because actually the government's theory throughout the case was that he did have the authority and that he abused his power by making the decision. A much more difficult question. Yeah. Yes. But what I will say is I'm not trying to suggest that this is okay.
Okay? We don't want public officials acting for personal reasons.
We don't want them acting necessarily for partisan or political reasons. But what I'm saying is the remedy for that is not the federal property fraud statutes. We have certainly political remedies that were very much -- had pretty substantial repercussions here.
There may also be state law constraints on official abuses of authority.
In fact, New Jersey has a statute called ""Official Misconduct"" that is specifically directed toward unauthorized decisions with bad purposes. That's not what the federal property fraud statute is concerned with.
The federal property fraud statute is concerned with cheating the government out of its property rights.
And that's just not what we have here. What we have here is an abuse of power, a political abuse of power, and -- and that's -- if anything, again, that sounds in honest services fraud, which this Court has limited, due to vagueness concerns, to bribes and kickbacks. Your Honor, if there are no further questions, thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Levy. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A public official who is acting politically and not for personal gain does not commit fraud by lying about his reason for an official decision if the decision was generally within his authority.
The government disputed that below but now urges that as the rule in this Court. That concession requires reversal. The government alleged and proved that Mr. Baroni was the co-head of the Port Authority, responsible for supervising all aspects of its operations.
The government itself elicited that there was never any policy that precluded Mr. Baroni from using his plenary authority to alter a traffic pattern. For the government's rule to work, this Court should require an objectively clear lack of authority, something not even arguably shown here.
Otherwise, any official who conceals his political motivation risks being convicted of fraud if a prosecutor or jury later disagrees about the scope of his authority.
If the government's rule is to provide any limits, this case must lie beyond those limits. I'd like to begin by discussing what the government alleged, argued, and proved below about Mr. Baroni's authority before it decided in this Court that an official's authority is the line between guilt and innocence under the fraud statutes. In the district court, the government alleged in the indictment that Mr. Baroni was responsible for the general supervision of all aspects of Port Authority business, including the operations of its transportation facilities. From its main cooperating witness, Mr. Wildstein, the government elicited that exact statement precisely, ticking off one of the allegations from the indictment.
It elicited from Mr. Wildstein that the -- that the title ""deputy executive director"" was a misnomer; that within the Port Authority structure, the deputy executive director and the executive director had a 50/50 -- 50/50 split in terms of power sharing; that the deputy executive director was not the Number 2 position within the Port Authority.
That's from the government's eliciting from its own cooperating witness. The government also -- The -- the arrangement is always that the -- there's a New York representative who's the executive director and the New Jersey representative who's the deputy; is that right? That was at the time the -- the arrangement.
It was -- it was always appointed by the governor of New Jersey for the deputy executive director, and the governor of New York for the executive director.
And it was understood within the agency by everyone, every -- all the witnesses the government called, testified that that was the arrangement.
They called Mr. Baroni's successor, who testified that that was the arrangement, that the one did not report to the other and that that -- And this is -- this is a bi-state agency.
Why -- why would New Jersey agree to an arrangement like that where its representative is always in the second seat, at least -- at least nominally -- nominally? Is it just the -- the big brother across the river; is that the -- I don't know the answer to that except that the -- the structure within the Port Authority was that that was not the case. So they, in fact, as it actually played out, didn't agree to play second fiddle.
It was understood that within the Port Authority, the deputy executive director had equal authority. The vice chairman testified about these parallel chains of -- of command that were understood.
Particularly for -- for decisions made within New Jersey, it was understood that that would fall within the deputy executive director's scope of authority. I think one of the government's main arguments for -- on the sufficiency of the evidence, which is fairly pro-government, and in this situation, was that Mr. Wildstein had to lie to the Port Authority employees about the executive director knowing about this lane change. If, in fact, the reality of the situation was that Mr. Baroni couldn't do this without the executive director's acquiescence or acceptance, doesn't that show his lack of authority? Isn't that -- why isn't that sufficient evidence? So -- so two things, Your Honor.
First of all, I don't believe we're here on a sufficiency ground and -- for reasons we argued in our reply brief.
But, even within that, we're not saying the lie might not be a piece of evidence, but even the government concedes in this case that the lie does not show a lack of authority. The government concedes that an authorized official is permitted to lie to their subordinates.
And so it cannot be that, circularly, that lie automatically establishes the lack of authority.
Here, all of the evidence at trial was that Mr. Baroni had plenary authority over the operations of the Port Authority. Mr. Wildstein actually testified -- his first answer when he was asked why did you come up with this traffic study, his first answer was: For purposes of the media and for purposes of explaining it to local officials. When pressed by the government, he said: Also to give a reason to -- to career officials.
But the fact that he has to -- not that he has to -- that he chooses to tell a lie to career officials to -- to make this go over more smoothly in the same way that a public official wouldn't tell the world that they're doing something for a political reason. Would you spend a moment on the traffic study? Certainly, Your Honor.
The -- the government has conceded that if Mr. -- and, again, this is new in this Court, all of these concessions -- that if Mr. Baroni had authority to order a traffic study, then he could do so even with the intention of causing traffic in Fort Lee.
And they concede that he had the authority to order a traffic study.
So all of that is conceded. What they say is he lied about the existence of a traffic study.
And as we point out in our reply brief, there was no lie about the existence of a traffic study.
There was no representation at all about the existence of a traffic study. Mr. Wildstein went to the bridge supervisors and told them: I would like to know what will happen, what the effect on traffic will be, if we switch these three lanes.
Please switch these three lanes -- or maybe not with the ""please"" -- and -- and study the results. Collect the numbers and tell me what the results are. The only part of that as a representation is the first part: I would like to know, my motivation is, my purpose is.
And the government agrees that's not capable of being the lie for purposes of a fraud conviction, a money and property fraud conviction. The other two parts are an instruction.
They were an instruction to do a traffic study.
And the employees at the Port Authority did that.
That's what the government spent a great deal of time at trial proving, is that money was spent on a traffic study that they say was illegitimate because nobody ever cared about the results. But the government agrees now that caring about the results is not an issue.
They say the traffic study didn't exist.
And that's just flatly contrary to -- Mr. Levy -- -- what's true. -- is it your position that -- suppose Mr. Baroni had said I'm giving you no reason at all or suppose Mr. Baroni had said we're going to do a traffic study, but it's going to be a sham traffic study. Would he still have had authority? Certainly, the first one. He certainly had at any point the discretion to say, as somebody had done very early on in creating these three traffic lanes -- they weren't required by anything -- at any point in time could -- could have said I think they should have a fourth or I think they should have only two or only one.
And that was fully within his authority.
And as the government argued and proved this case below, that was their point, that was their summation, was he abused the authority he was entrusted with. And the second, we're going to do a sham traffic study? I -- I think he can -- he can do that.
I think, as a functional matter, who knows what actually results from that, but, yes, he has the authority to say we're going to do a traffic study because I want to do this thing and -- and for public reasons, it's easier to do a traffic study. And you said that this was not a sufficiency question.
But what is it if it's not a sufficiency question because, as I understand your arguments, you're not pointing to any instruction that was incorrect or to -- to the rejection of an instruction that you offered, so how are we to look at this other than through a sufficiency lens? Frankly, the -- the -- the most obvious way to do is as a government forfeiture of the issue.
The -- the defendants in the district court said the line is authority and if we were authorized, then -- then that is a complete defense and the government told the district court do not give that instruction. And the district court said, I'm not giving that instruction because it is not a defense and I don't want to confuse the jury into believing it is. Now, in this Court, the government is saying, actually, it turns out the hinge between guilt and innocence is whether or not he was authorized and we get the benefit of a sufficiency of the evidence deferential review, even though we told the district court that this issue didn't matter at all. The government has forfeited the opportunity to prove that Mr. Baroni lacked authority.
We offered to have that fight in the district court and they said it didn't matter. Now, in this Court, this Court should assume that there was no lack of -- Is there -- -- authority. -- any -- any reason to think that the jury actually made a finding about Baroni's authority? No, there is no reason whatsoever.
The -- the district court was attempting to make sure that they didn't consider that to be relevant or that -- that was what we pressed, was this is the relevant distinction and the district court wanted to be sure that the jury did not believe that it would be a defense. And nothing in the -- in the jury instructions suggested that it would be a defense.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The defendants in this case committed fraud by telling a lie to take control over the physical access lanes to the George Washington Bridge and the employee resources necessary to realign them.
Unless they lied about the existence of a Port Authority traffic study, none of them had the power to direct those resources and realign the lanes. Because they told that lie, those resources were answering to them, to their own private purposes rather than to the public officials who were duly appointed to decide what those resources should be allocated to do. Their actions in this case were fraud in just the same way that it would be fraud for someone with no connection to the Port Authority to impersonate Port Authority supervisors and order Port Authority employees to realign Port Authority lanes. Or if we want to put this in the private context: For someone to usurp the authority by deception of a taxicab company's dispatcher and order the cabs and the drivers to go wherever the fraudster pleases. They don't get a free pass simply because Baroni worked for the Port Authority when the evidence showed that he didn't have the power to direct these resources in this way without telling the lie. They don't get a free pass because they're hypothesizing that legitimate decision-makers might, in theory, have decided to realign the lanes when the precise point of their scheme was to take these resources out of the legitimate decision-maker's hands and put them into their own hands. And they don't get a free pass simply because their motive happened to be political. Let me start with the legal argument that was made by Kelly's counsel, which seems to be drawing a distinction between public uses and private uses.
And I think there are two main problems with that. Actually, probably three.
One is, I don't see where a license for that is in the statute.
And that gets me right to the second problem, which is that it seems to draw a distinction between fraud where the victim is a public entity and fraud where the victim is a private entity.
And the Court rejected that distinction in Pasquantino. I don't know in the taxicab hypothetical what it means to say that it's only fraud if those cabs then go to private use. It's a -- we're talking about a private company in that context. And the third problem is, I don't know how a jury -- I -- I think some justices on this Court were grappling with this -- I don't know how a jury decides the difference between a public and a private use. How -- how -- There can be -- -- do you -- I mean, you have two separate points, I think.
One -- one is your statement now, which I think is stronger than in your brief, that if you have authority and you work for a government, only if you say and tell them a lie, an untruth, then you don't have authority. My goodness, the Code of Federal Regulations, the rules of any department, the -- I mean, the government is filled with rules. And there are numerous instances where a person might say something untrue about something related to a rule that gives him authority for that.
That's enough to take -- we're -- we're back to honest services.
And that's also true of the second. If, in fact, I can -- there are two separate parts to the second, I might as well get both questions out, is that fair? The one on authority is I -- I don't know where that comes from.
But if you have authority to do something in government, but you can't or you lie about some -- anything, that wouldn't -- you wouldn't without it, well, then you're in the property stealing statute. And the second problem with your second claim is, if you don't have authority, but you put what you take to a public use -- now, either that is, does, is -- is -- is -- is a conversion of property and -- a -- a -- obtaining of property within the statute or it isn't. If it is, I don't see how honest services fraud is not back in the statute, which has been ruled out since McNally.
And if it isn't, I don't see how this case works. Well, Your Honor, let me answer the second part of your question first and then I'll try to get back to the first part. To answer the second part of your question, I don't -- as I was saying, I don't think there's a distinction between private and public uses works, because that's not a distinction that the statute draws.
It's not a distinction -- Well, then -- -- you can draw -- -- we're back to -- -- with public entities -- My point was -- -- and -- -- why then -- we're back to honest services. So -- There is no deprivation -- But that's -- -- of honest services that does not require somebody in the government to spend some time or use some paper or use a telephone in order to achieve that dishonest thing, all right? If you're going to count that as property, well, fine, you could do it, I guess under some statute, but if you do it under this statute, this statute then prohibits the taking of dishonest services, exactly what the Court has held it doesn't do. So, Your Honor, if -- if I might answer that, it will take me a second to play this out, but I think it's a very important distinction.
They're trying to lump a bunch of different kinds of frauds together and make them all sound as if they're the same.
This case is about a very specific kind of fraud, commandeering fraud. It is when the defendant tries to take over property that is in the hands of the victim and manage it as if it is his own property. That's what they were doing with the lanes on the bridge and the employee resources. So, for example, if there's a snowplow sitting there and I take the keys to the snowplow and I drive off in the snowplow, everyone would agree that I've obtained the snowplow. If I instead put on one of those masks from the mission impossible TV show or the movie and I impersonate the boss of the snowplow driver and I tell the snowplow driver to drive around in the snowplow and do the exact same thing that I was going to do, I have obtained the snowplow and the driver services by fraud. Well, but -- but -- But not every fraudulent scheme and not every deceptive scheme works that way.
Sometimes there are deceptive schemes in which somebody simply wants an agency to do something or wants a private victim to do something on his behalf.
And then you have to look at what is actually the object of the scheme and how the scheme works to see if the agency is deprived of property.
So -- But the basic difference between the taking the snowplow is that the official has no authority to take the snowplow for his private uses.
The official does have authority to regulate how lanes are used on -- on the -- on the highway and say these are going to be used for Fort Lee, these aren't. Well, first of all, Your Honor, Baroni did not have that authority in this case, and -- Well, that's -- -- and I can get to the evidence -- -- disputed. I can get to the -- I can get to the evidence of that in a second.
But also I -- I don't think that it's fair to call this a public use.
What we would say is a public use is the use to which the legitimate supervisors of the Port Authority have decided to put the Port Authority -- Okay.
So what you're saying, your theory is that by the actions in this case, they have commandeered the lanes on the expressway? Yes, Your Honor. That's -- they commandeered the lanes and the resources necessary to reallocate. They're still being used for public purposes. Your Honor, I'm not sure what they mean when they say they are being used for public purposes.
So if -- Because if other people want to use the highway to get to Fort Lee, they can. So -- They have nothing to do with the scheme at all. So, Your Honor, I -- I guess I would -- I would push back on this to this extent.
If they decided to close the bridge, is that a public use or private use? If they decide that only Kelly can use that lane, is that a public use or a private use? If they decide that only red cars can go down that lane, is that public or private use? They didn't decide any of those things. Well -- They said anybody. It was just a problem getting there -- Well, Your Honor -- -- which was quite a problem, I grant you.
Quite a problem.
But they used it for cars going down.
Well, snowplow. Well, Your Honor -- Hey, there's a law here, a rule, a rule, no, a rule: Treat every street alike.
And you know what the snowplow operator did? He snowplowed the mayor's street first. Now, that is not a good thing to do. It is really undesirable.
And maybe it should be a crime.
But 30 years in prison? That, I'm not sure.
And that's -- this statute has to do with property fraud.
And is taking the snowplow and putting it to the use of the public streets in violation of a rule, treating the mayor better -- is that a property crime? Your Honor, in that -- in that law -- in that hypothetical, there is -- we would not say that is fraud.
There is no lie.
There's nothing material.
There's -- Oh, of course, there is. -- no intent to fraud. My -- my where are you going? I am going to Fifth Street first, and then I will go to the grocery store down the street -- Yeah. --- and then I -- Ah. And you know what he did? He went to the city councilman's street.
All right? There's a lie. It's easy to make up cases that there's a lie in, and that's my problem, same problem.
We're back into honest services fraud, which is fraud and bad.
And -- and the question is does this statute get it? We are not in honest services fraud, Your Honor.
First of all, the lie in your hypothetical was not a lie that was told to obtain property.
It was just a lie about what he was going to do. But here's the reason we're not in -- They wouldn't have -- -- honest services fraud -- They wouldn't have given it to him if they -- In -- in the honest services frauds -- fraud cases, in McNally, for example, there was no dispute that the defendants in McNally had the authority to decide who was going to insure the State of Kentucky. Well -- The problem was -- Mr. Feigin, that -- this is what troubles me about your -- your argument.
Your argument is that, if Baroni was authorized, he could not be convicted; am I right? Yes -- If he had the authority -- -- if Baroni had the authority to do what he did, then he's not committing fraud. All right.
And you say -- Even if he tells a lie. Okay.
And -- and you say that takes care of a lot of these hypotheticals that seem -- that are disturbing to some people.
And you say: But the jury found that he was authorized, and there's sufficient evidence to support that finding. That's the -- The jury found he wasn't authorized -- I'm sorry.
The jury found -- Yes. -- he was not authorized, and there's sufficient -- That's correct. -- evidence, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to support the finding. But I see no indication whatsoever, no reason to believe the jury made any such finding.
I've read these jury instructions several times.
There's nothing in there that would alert a jury, a juror, to the obligation to find that Baroni was unauthorized, unless I missed something. Let me say a couple things about that.
One, they did not make an objection to the jury instructions properly either -- in the court of appeals.
It's not part of the -- No, I -- -- question presented here. I know that.
But I've never -- Okay. -- I've never seen a criminal case where we're asked to defer to a jury's finding on something that the jury didn't find.
Putting aside the question of whether there's any evidence to show that he lacked authority. So let me point you to a -- a couple of places, and then let me talk a little about the evidence of lack of authority. First of all, there's the instruction that the court of appeals deemed adequate, and that's at page 875 of the Joint Appendix, which is the instruction on obtaining property, which the court of appeals deemed sufficient to notify the jury that when someone is acting on behalf of an organization, acting as the agent of that organization, he's not obtaining property when he exercises the authority that the agency is duly conferred on him. But even better than that is the materiality instruction from pages 875 to 876, which says that if you find that the representation that the lane and toll booth reductions was for the purpose of a -- for the -- was for the purpose of a traffic study was false, you must determine whether that representation was one that a reasonable person might have considered important in making his or her decision to commit Port Authority resources for that endeavor, including services of Port Authority personnel. What -- what does that -- That -- What does that say about authorize -- about authority to -- Your Honor, if -- -- to reallocate the lanes? If Baroni actually had the authority to reallocate the lanes for any reason or no reason, as his counsel just stated to this Court that he did, I don't see how the jury could have found that the lies that they told were material.
Baroni -- Mr. Feigin, everybody has authority to spend or do their act on behalf of the agency.
Anybody who does it for their own personal purposes is unauthorized. So it's meaningless to say is he authorized or not.
Did he have authority to close the lanes under certain circumstances? Well, Your Honor, I don't -- Did he have authority to close the lanes on his own say? He might have, Your Honor.
What he didn't have -- Did you prove -- -- was the authority -- -- that -- did you prove that he had limited authority? Where did you prove that? We proved that he did not have the authority to close the lanes under these circumstances without telling the lie. And I -- I can explain why if you would like. In -- when Wildstein proposed the idea of realigning the lanes, Baroni's immediate response was to ask Wildstein how he was going to do that.
Wildstein then came up with the idea that they would have a traffic cover story -- the cover story of a traffic study, and he explained at the time to Kelly that one purpose of the traffic study cover story was in order to enlist the Port Authority officials that they would need in order to realign the lanes. He then had to lie to both the manager of the George Washington Bridge and the manager of tunnels, bridges, and terminals that the executive director was aware of this and apparently had tacitly approved of it; where, in fact, they were absolutely concealing it from the executive director. By the way -- Wildstein -- -- if -- if, contrary to the -- their expectations, there had been no slowing of traffic and, in fact, the lanes on one-lane traffic remained the same or maybe improved, would you still have a case here? Yes, Your Honor.
It's not about the effect of -- And so -- -- although the effect was catastrophic and that was a reason why the prosecution was brought, because of the incredible danger in which they put the citizens and commuters of Fort Lee, but they would still have committed the same crime. And they were hiding it from the executive director.
Wildstein testified directly that there were processes in place to use the Port Authority resources, and he didn't follow them.
And when the executive director found out, he immediately canceled it and he stated that the process had been ""subverted."" Mr. Feigin -- Now, Baroni clearly had significant authority within the Port Authority organization, but when someone questions how they're going to do something, has no idea how he's going to do something, and has to lie in order to accomplish it, has to lie that his boss has approved it, has to conceal it from his boss and has to avoid every legitimate -- But isn't it -- -- process verification. -- isn't it often the case that somebody who has the authority to do something may lie about why the person is doing the thing because, if the real reason was exposed, there would be -- it would cause a furor, people would be angry, but that doesn't show the person doesn't have the authority to do it. A person hires his brother-in-law for a position.
Why did you hire this particular person? Well, this person is the very best qualified person for this job.
When the real reason is his wife wants him to do it. (Laughter.) He doesn't want to say it.
Does that show he didn't have the authority to fill this position? No, Your Honor, then -- but that's not the only piece of evidence we're relying on, and it's a different kind of lie. This isn't a lie about why they're doing it. This is a lie that Wildstein directly testified that they needed to tell in order to get the resources that they -- that they needed. It was clearly important to the George Washington Bridge manager and the manager of tunnels, bridges, and terminals.
This was something the executive director knew about. Both the executive director and the vice chairman of the Port Authority Board of Commissioners testified that they would expect to be notified about something that was even an order of magnitude less disruptive than this was ever going to be, and they weren't notified. Why -- Mr. Feigin -- What do you do about this, this is the same, but I don't want to lose what the question was in light of the instructions given. And what I have so far found is that the defense did ask the jury to be instructed to do just what you want.
They asked the jury -- they said: Judge, tell the jury that if the Port Authority granted or bestowed on the defendants the power or authority to control the property, the bridge, et cetera, and that they acted within the bounds of that authority, then you can't find the scheme to defraud. I think you agree with that.
And the problem is the judge said no, I won't give that instruction.
Then what the judge gave as an instruction -- insofar as the court of appeals -- and we're reviewing the court of appeals.
Insofar as the court of appeals said, well, they gave the essence of it, this was the instruction supposed to be the essence of it. To establish a scheme to defraud, the government must also prove that the scheme contemplated depriving the authority -- the Port Authority, the port people, of money and property.
What? That's the essence of what he didn't give? Now, I -- I -- I haven't read the two instructions you read, but the one that I read, I think, is the one that the court of appeals relied upon. So, Your Honor -- So what do we do about that? Well, Your Honor, I would look back at the materiality instruction I was discussing with Justice -- Yeah. -- Alito. But that isn't what the court of appeals relied on. Well, Your Honor, I think if the court of appeals got the substance of it right, and you don't agree with its particular reasoning, there is no reason to reverse, particularly when the question hasn't even been presented to this Court. This question -- this point was only really raised in the reply brief of Baroni who didn't even petition.
But let me address the authority instruction that was rejected by the district court directly. That instruction was proposed in the context primarily of an instruction on 18 U.S.C. 666, which is the more general misappropriation of federal funds statute.
And the instruction on that, which appears at page 870 of the Joint Appendix, already itself contains a reference to authority. Both the government and the district court were quite clear in the district court -- and you'll see this finding by both the court of appeals and the district court -- that Baroni and Kelly were free to argue the authority issue.
The only question was whether the jury was going to get a specific instruction on that point. And the government believed the instruction was unnecessary.
It was -- it would have been a novel addition to the Third Circuit's pattern jury instruction on section 666, and, moreover, I don't know that their instruction was, in fact, correct because it would -- might have confused the jury into thinking -- and this goes back to my colloquy with Justice Sotomayor -- that if Baroni had some authority under some circumstances, that that would exonerate -- But you say -- -- all of the defendants. -- the instruction -- you -- you thought the instruction was unnecessary.
Well, that may have been the case in light of your theory at the time, but surely after your focus here on the authority point, you -- you wouldn't make that same statement. Well, Your Honor, I think that in retrospect it might have been better to instruct the jury somewhat more specifically on authority.
I don't know that there's specific -- Somewhat more -- -- their specific -- -- specifically on the central point of your argument before us today. I don't know their specific instruction would have accomplished it. And I don't know the instructional issue is before the Court -- is before the Court today. But we are defending this -- these convictions on the precise same ground that they were found to be valid by both the court of appeals and the district court, which addressed the authority issue. The district court addressed the authority issue before trial telling the defendants they could argue it at trial.
It addressed it after trial, saying it believed the authority had been proven.
And then the Third Circuit addressed it. And we have been consistent throughout in that -- that we have never argued, to my knowledge -- and I certainly haven't identified a place where we have argued -- that if Baroni, in fact, had the authority that his counsel just claimed he had, which is to realign the lanes for any reason or no reason, that these defendants could have -- Mr. Feigin -- -- been convicted of fraud. -- nobody, no decision-maker has the authority to make any decision for no reason.
That's a misnomer in terms. People have authority to do things only in the interest of the agency.
So give me a line drawing of for a reason or no reason, meaning, I don't think anybody in the Port Authority, including the executive director, could on whim say: Ah, you know, I like playing on a board.
Let's change it to one lane because I just like to see a different pattern today. So my -- my apologies, Your Honor. I -- I -- I simply -- -- I -- so -- so give me your definition of what ""authorized"" means, if he had the ability -- and when I first read your brief, it was if he had the ability to change the lanes on his own, then he had authority. Yeah.
That -- All right.
Now, what the limits of that authority are, is where I -- where I'm trying to get you. So, Your Honor, if he were -- How -- but it can't be no -- no authority. So, Your Honor -- Does he never have authority -- -- I was -- I apologize, I was simply repeating the language that the court of appeals itself used which may have been a little hyperbolic, but if he were the person to whom the Port Authority entrusted the decision of whether there should be three lanes or one, such that his decision under these circumstances would govern, then he had the authority. I think the evidence showed that he was not that person.
Again, he had to lie -- The fact that -- -- about his boss -- -- the -- the fact that the executive director could overturn him doesn't prove the positive. That's right, Your Honor. We wouldn't rely on that piece of evidence alone, just like, Justice Alito, we're not relying alone on the fact -- on the fact that he had -- that he told a lie.
We're relying on a combination of circumstances. Again, as -- as I was saying earlier, if -- when an idea of something to do with my organization's resources is raised to me and my initial reaction is, how are we going to do that, and then the idea is to tell a lie that will get everyone onboard with it, and then we lie about the fact that my boss is aware of it and -- and tacitly approves of it, we avoid every legitimate process and we conceal it from my boss. I think a reasonable jury can rationally conclude that I'm doing something that I don't have the authority to do.
And that's -- Mr. Feigin -- please finish. Sorry, I was just going to say, that's what Baroni did here.
Apologies -- Can -- can -- -- Justice Kagan. Can I switch, because the statute clearly says that a scheme of deception has to -- the object of it has to be to obtain property.
So can we talk about that for a minute? Because if I look at this, and I'm an ordinary juror, I'm thinking, you know, the object of this deception was not to obtain property.
The object was to create a traffic jam.
The object was to benefit people politically.
You can frame the object in lots of ways. But notwithstanding that some employee time was given over to this scheme, that was not the object of the scheme, was it, to appropriate that employee time? Well, Your Honor, I think it was because this was -- this gets back to what I was saying to Justice Breyer earlier. This is a particular type of fraud, where -- it's commandeering fraud, where what they're trying to do is to take property that's in the victim's hands, here the Port Authority, and convert it to their own uses. It may be that if I take a knife off a table and stab -- that doesn't belong to me, and stab someone, my end goal is to stab someone but I've still stolen the knife. But wasn't the commandeering here completely incidental, indeed unnecessary to the scheme being carried out? In other words, you know, there was a little bit of -- of -- of time for an extra toll person, actually to mitigate the -- the problems of the traffic jam or there were some people running around counting cars to conceal the purpose for what they were -- of what they were doing, but that was not the object of the scheme. No, Your Honor, the object of the scheme was for them to take control of real property, physical lanes, accessing the George Washington Bridge, and have those lanes be allocated the way they wanted. Okay.
So that's a different theory.
That's not the employee time and labor.
That's something about like appropriating the George Washington Bridge; is that right? That is one -- But it's not appropriating the George Washington Bridge, it's reallocating lanes on the George Washington Bridge and I would have thought that Cleveland makes clear that that's not an appropriation of property either. I -- I -- Your Honor, I think it's both because they needed the employee resources in order to accomplish what they were trying to do with the bridge. And if I could address Cleveland for a second, this case and Cleveland do both involve governmental decision-making but that's where the similarities end. In Cleveland, the object of the scheme was to obtain a license under a regulatory scheme that had no private analog whatsoever. The Court rejected every private analog the government offered for it.
And the license wasn't property in the government's hands. Here you're talking about real property, physical lanes and who can access those lanes, and access rights to physical property are quintessential forms of private property, probably one of the oldest forms of property we have. And then you have the employee resources necessary to reallocate the lanes, which I think even they acknowledge are property under the fraud statute.
They acknowledge that if you send painters to paint the mayor's house, that that's going to be property fraud because you're taking the employee services. But that's because the object of the scheme is to use the employee labor to get your house painted, but I -- I don't think that you can say the same thing here. Your Honor, the -- You were not -- -- reason -- -- using the employee labor to create the traffic jam. They are using the employee labor as if it were theirs, not as if it were something that the Port Authority gets to use.
So, again, in the private context, if I were to impersonate the boss and start ordering around the company jet, I think I have obtained the company jet and probably -- Well, but you picked -- -- the pilot's time as well. You -- you picked -- you picked an example that is easy for you.
I mean, the example that's hard for you, I think, is you tell the employee to pick up the phone and call somebody and say this.
That's a bad thing. And then immediately you say: Okay, it's property fraud because I've used the -- the employee has used the telephone, or I've used the four minutes of that employee's time necessary to convey the message. So -- Your theory would say that that's taking of property so it's covered by the fraud statutes. We wouldn't, Your Honor, and I'm -- I'm actually glad to have a -- a chance to -- to make this perfectly clear.
And this gets back to Justice Kagan's question as well. Incidental uses of property that are not the object of the scheme are not going to be sufficient for property fraud.
And I think the easiest place to look for that is this Court's decision in Loughrin, which involved bank fraud. And the Court said there that if you tell a lie and the object of your lie is to obtain money, it's not bank fraud simply because, unrelated to your lie, you didn't really care how the money came to you.
The money comes to you in the form of a check, which is bank property, as opposed to in the form of cash, which isn't. If someone is -- if someone tells a lie and the object is to obtain a license from the State of Louisiana to operate a video poker machine, which is not property, they're not committing property fraud just because some employee needs to spend some time processing the license.
That's not the object. Well, here the object -- the object of the scheme was not to commandeer lanes on the bridge.
The object was to cause a traffic jam in Fort Lee.
And if they could have done it some other way, they would have done it some other way. The use of the traffic -- you know, altering the traffic lane configuration was just the incidental means of achieving the objective. I don't think that's right, Your Honor.
The lie they told to the Port Authority to get the Port Authority resources was to -- a lie they told in order to get those resources.
The causing of the traffic jam was what they wanted to accomplish with those resources. If I tell a lie to get access to the company jet, it may be that my goal is to take it on a vacation trip to Macao, but that's not the object of the scheme as far as the fraud is concerned and the victim of the fraud. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Roth. Thank you.
Your Honor, the -- the federal property fraud statute prohibits schemes to obtain property.
And the government's theory of property here, as I think we just heard, is that the officials, by making this decision about lane alignment, commandeered the control over the George Washington Bridge. That is exactly the type of regulatory control that Cleveland said is not property.
Cleveland referred to the intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and control.
And the sovereign's intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and control are not property for purposes of this statute. And, therefore, if what the officials did was used a seat to influence the exercise of those rights, they have not obtained property from the Port Authority.
If that is not correct, then everything an official does is -- falls within the scope of this statute, and the only question that is open is was there some deceit involved? And if -- if that is right, I think the chilling effect on honest public servants is going to be severe. Mr. Roth, you responded to one-half of their theory.
One-half of their theory is the allocation of lanes. Yes. And the other half is the employee time. Yes. So what's your response to that? My response to that, it's actually what he said at the end, which is that the incidental costs of a decision are not the -- are not its object.
And it's what Your Honor asked in earlier question.
The implementation of the regulatory decision is going to use some public resources.
That cannot possibly change the result, or else Cleveland is a complete dead letter. Why do you call it incidental? I mean, it was essential to the scheme. Because it's incidental, Your Honor, in that it -- it was the implementation cost.
It flowed as -- as a result of the regulatory decision.
The regulatory decision was to realign the lanes. That required some employee time in terms of taking tolls and studying the traffic effect, but that was not the object.
That was how it got done. What if it cost a million dollars? Would it be incidental? No -- yes, Your Honor.
It would be a incidental.
It's not a de minimis test.
It's a question of what is the object. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We will hear argument first this morning in Case Number 19-431, Little Sisters of the Poor versus Pennsylvania, and the consolidated case. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2011, the government required employers to provide insurance coverage for all FDA-approved contraception, including many religious employers who objected to the coverage, sparking years of litigation.
In 2017, in the best traditions of this country's commitment to religious liberty, the government sought to resolve the issue by promulgating new rules exempting those employers who objected to the mandate. Those exemptions are lawful for two reasons.
First, they're authorized by Section 13(a)(4) of the ACA, which requires employers to provide the types of coverage that the Health Resources and Services Administration provides for and supports.
So it authorizes the agencies to require most employers to provide contraceptive coverage while exempting a small number of employers who have sincere conscientious objections. But it doesn't create an all-or-nothing choice: require coverage for everyone or no one.
Otherwise, the long-standing church exemption, the effective exemption for self-insured church plans, and, indeed, Respondents' understanding of the accommodation itself would also violate the statute since the employers' group health plans don't provide the mandated coverage. Second, RFRA at the very least authorizes the religious exemption.
It prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden on religious beliefs subject to a discretionary exception.
It may substantially burden religious beliefs if it can satisfy strict scrutiny. But RFRA doesn't require the government to do that.
Otherwise, the government would have to divine the stingiest accommodations that a court would uphold, virtually guaranteeing a loss in every case. Neither RFRA nor the ACA requires that result. I'd like to begin with the Section 13(a)(4) issue, which requires employers to provide whatever coverage HRSA provides for and supports. General, before you -- And, here, HRSA -- -- before you get to that, I'd like to ask you a question on your RFRA point.
I wonder why it doesn't sweep too broadly.
It is designed to address the concerns about self-certification and what the Little Sisters call the hijacking of their plan. But the RFRA exemption reaches far beyond that.
In other words, not everybody who seeks the protection from coverage has those same objections.
So I wonder if your reliance on RFRA is too broad. I don't think so, Your Honor, for a couple of different reasons. First, RFRA itself, in its operative language, prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden subject to a single exception.
And when you look at that exception, what it says is that the government may impose that burden if it thinks it can satisfy strict scrutiny. So, once there's a substantial burden, the government has the flexibility to lift it in different ways, including through a traditional exemption.
Otherwise, this Court's decision in Zubik doesn't make a whole lot of sense because, there, the Court ordered the government to consider further modifying the accommodation, even assuming the accommodation fully satisfied That doesn't make sense if RFRA prohibits anything that it doesn't affirmatively require. Thank you. But, secondly, even if the -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas.
Justice Thomas. Well, we'll come back to Justice Thomas. Justice Ginsburg? The glaring feature of what the government has done in expanding this exemption is to toss to the winds entirely Congress's instruction that women need and shall have seamless, no-cost, comprehensive coverage. Seamless, no-cost, comprehensive coverage. This leaves the women to hunt for other government programs that might cover them, and for those who are not covered by Medicaid or one of the other government programs, they can get contraceptive coverage only from paying out of their own pocket, which is exactly what Congress didn't want to happen. And in this area of religious freedom, the major trend is not to give everything to one side and nothing to the other side.
We have had a history of accommodation, tolerance here, respect for the employer's workers and students who do not share the employer's or the university's objections to contraceptives. And every time we have dealt with this subject, we have assumed that there would be a way to provide coverage that would not involve any cost-sharing by the individual.
So, in Hobby Lobby, we assumed that the self-certification was okay because women -- women could receive coverage without any cost-sharing by the organization, the group health plan, or the participants. And then, in Wheaton, we said nothing in the interim rules affects the ability of applicants, employees, and students to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives. And finally, in Zubik, we said -- we instructed the parties to endeavor to put in place an accommodation of the employer's religious exercise while at the same time ensuring women covered by employers' health plans, ensuring that women receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage. You have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is, that women be provided these service -- services, with no hassle, no cost to them. Instead, you are shifting the employer's religious beliefs, the cost of that, on to these employees who do not share those religious beliefs.
And I did not understand RFRA to authorize harm to other people, which is evident here, that the -- the women end up getting nothing.
They -- they are required to do just what Congress didn't want. General Francisco, could you respond? Yes. Respectfully, Your Honor, I think I would disagree with the premise of your question because there's nothing in the ACA, as this Court recognized in Hobby Lobby, that requires contraceptive coverage.
Rather, it delegated to the agencies the discretion to decide whether or not to cover it in the first place. And we think that that also includes the discretion to require that most employers provide it, but not the small number who have sincere conscientious objections, because, otherwise, the original church exemption, likewise, would be illegal, as would the effective exemption for self-insured church plans. The church itself -- But even putting that -- -- the church itself has enjoyed traditionally an exception from the very first case, the McClure case in the Fifth -- Fifth Circuit.
The church itself is different from these organizations that employ a lot of people who do not share the employer's faith. And I thought that Congress had delegated to HRSA for its expertise in what contraceptive coverage women would need. Brief -- briefly, General Francisco? Yes, Your Honor. Respectfully, the church exemption and the effective exemption for self-insured church plans read much more broadly.
They encompass not just churches and their integrated auxiliaries but elementary schools, high schools, colleges, universities, charitable organizations, hospitals, and other healthcare organizations.
So I don't think that they're authorized by the so-called ministerial exception.
Rather, they're authorized by Section 13(a)(4) and by RFRA. Thank you. Justice Thomas? I think you're back. General Francisco, a quick question about HRSA's broad authority. You seem to, as you did in your past -- your last answer, suggest that HCRA has almost unlimited authority to both create guidelines and exceptions from those guidelines. First, if you would give us just an idea of what standards are to guide that -- their discretion and -- and the services that are provided, as well as the exemptions that are offered by the guidelines. Yes, Your Honor. I think there are three limitations that I would point to.
First, because HRSA has the discretion not to require any contraceptive coverage at all, as this Court acknowledged in Hobby Lobby, I think that that plainly encompasses the discretion to require coverage by most employers but not the small number with sincere conscientious objections. Secondly, it's further constrained by the APA's requirement for reasoned decision-making which prohibits arbitrary -- which would prohibit arbitrary exemptions. And, third, I think that the term ""preventive services"" in the statute itself potentially provides yet another limitation since, at the very least, that would encompass the types of things that governments traditionally take into account when regulating in this area, including the impact that their regulations would have on religious believers. And I'd point you to the Federal Register, 83 Federal Register at 58598, where the government goes through in detail the history of according conscientious objectors protections when regulating in these very sensitive medical areas. At what point do you run into a non-delegation problem? Your Honor, I don't think we have a non-delegation problem at all here for the reasons we've said.
I think all of those would establish limiting principles, including the -- the phrase ""preventive services,"" which at the very least would limit what the government can do to the types of things that traditionally it has done when regulating in this area. If I could just give you a quick hypothetical.
Suppose the Department of -- the Congress delegated to the Department of Defense the authority to create a draft.
I think that that would necessarily include the authority for the Department of Defense to craft conscientious objections to the draft precisely because that's the type of thing that governments traditionally consider in that area. Likewise, here, in regulating in sensitive medical areas, governments traditionally take into account the impact that their regulations have on conscientious objectors. Thank you, General. Justice Breyer? Good morning, General.
I had exactly the same question as Justice Thomas's first question, so -- about what are the standards that govern when the agency can make exceptions and how and what they must look like. So, if you have anything to add on that, do.
And, if not, thank you very much and you can go on to the next question. Your Honor, the only thing I would add is that I think all of these limitations would fully make sure that any time that HRSA's exercising its discretion, it's doing so in a rational way. After all, this is the very same discretion that was used not just to adopt the church exemption but also the effective exemption for self-insured church plans, and, under Respondents' understanding of the accommodation, even the accommodation itself, since, in each one of those three instances, the employers' benefits plan is not providing the mandated coverage and, in two of them, nobody is providing the mandated coverage. And so, if you concluded that the agencies didn't have this discretion, that would undermine the validity of the church exemption, the effective exemption for self-insured church plans, and potentially the accommodation more broadly. Thank you. Justice Alito? General, what factors, other than medical need, can HRSA or could HRSA take into account in deciding which preventive services and the degree to which preventive services would have to be covered by an insurance plan? For example, could it take cost into account? Well, Your Honor, if it took cost into account, I think that the question -- the first question would be whether the manner in which it took cost into account satisfied the arbitrary and capricious standard. And I certainly do think that they could take cost into account in deciding what types of preventative services to require.
If, for example, there was a particular type of preventative service that was a new technology that was actually quite -- quite helpful, but it was cost-prohibitive for just about every employer or any insurance company to cover, I certainly think that HRSA could take that into account in deciding whether or not to require it, pursuant to the guidelines issued under Section 13(a)(4). This broad issue has been before this Court on a number of prior occasions, and until this case, I hadn't seen the argument that the Affordable Care Act did not allow HRSA to make any exceptions based on conscientious objection.
When did this argument first surface? To my knowledge, Your Honor, it first surfaced in this litigation.
But, if you look back to the promulgation of the original church exemption back on August 3, 2011, and you look at the Federal Register notice, it makes crystal-clear that the church exemption was based on Section 13(a)(4). In describing Section 13(a)(4), the government determined that it had the authority under 13(a)(4) to promulgate the church exemption.
And that's likewise the reason why the effective exemption that covers all self-insured church plans and the accommodation more generally is likewise lawful under 13(a)(4).
Under my friend's position on the other side, I think all of those things would violate 13(a)(4). Thank you. Thank you, General. Justice Sotomayor? General, first of all, you keep calling it a small number of women who won't get coverage, but I understand the figure to be between -- somewhere between 75 -- 750,000 -- 75,000 and 125,000 women, correct? Well, Your Honor, yes, that's the number that would be affected by the exemptions as compared to the original church exemption and effective exemptions that cover -- that affected around 30,000 women. But I would note that in this particular litigation, the Respondents haven't yet identified anyone who would actually lose access to contraception as a result of these rules, I think presumably because contraception -- access to contraception is widely available in this country through many other means -- Well, General, let's -- let's -- -- besides forcing -- -- let's go there. HHS decided that contraceptives were a preventive service required under the Act. Now you say it has to take care to both promulgate the Act and accommodate religious objections.
But, in your calculus, what you haven't considered or told me about is the effect on women -- on women who can't -- who -- who now have to go out, as Justice Ginsburg said, and search for contraceptive coverage if they can't personally afford it. And I just wonder if I -- if there is no substantial burden, how can the government justify an exemption that deprives those women of seamless coverage? So, Your Honor, two points.
First of all, I think 13(a)(4) is what provides them the -- the discretion to do it, which is what they did in the effective exemption that covers self-insured church plans. That imposes no more or less of a burden than this exemption does. But putting that to the side, RFRA itself at Section 2000bb-4 explicitly permits any exemption that doesn't violate the Establishment Clause.
And, here, I don't think there's any plausible argument that the exemptions violate the Establishment Clause under this Court's decision in Amos, which upheld the Title VII exemption to religious employers, which, after all, authorized religious employers to fire an employee for religious reasons. And since it's permitted under RFRA, then I -- and it's permitted under Section 13(a)(4), I don't think any of these considerations undermine the validity of these final rules. One last -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Thank you. Good morning, General.
I'd like to go back to -- Good morning, Your Honor. -- the Chief Justice's first question, which was about whether this rule sweeps too broadly.
And I understand your concern about giving agencies some leeway so that there's -- they don't have to think through thousands of accommodations in their head and then find the narrowest one possible for every person.
But that's not really the situation we're in with respect to this. There was an existing accommodation in place, and some employers had objections to that accommodation, the Little Sisters and some others.
And even assuming that those objections needed to be taken into account, the rule sweeps far more broadly than that and essentially scraps the existing accommodation even for employers who have no religious objection to it. And sort of by definition, doesn't that mean that the rule has gone too far? No, Your Honor, for two reasons.
First of all, the accommodation is available.
It's not been scrapped.
But, secondly, including contraception as a seamless part of your insurance plan doesn't actually cost employers anything.
So there's no reason why an employer who doesn't object to providing contraception as part of their plan, whether through the accommodation or otherwise, would invoke the exemption since they would be depriving their employees of a valuable benefit to which they do not object and that doesn't cost them anything. But I would -- I guess I -- I mean, do you have -- -- would add if there were -- -- do you have any evidence that the current exemption is being taken -- availed -- that only employers of the Little Sister kind who have complicity objections are now taking advantage of the exemption? I would think that there would be a lot of employers who would say, you know, we don't have those complicity beliefs, but now that they're giving us an option, sure, we'll take it. Your Honor, I respectfully think that that would be irrational, given that employers would then be depriving their employees of a valuable benefit that doesn't cost them anything, because it doesn't cost any money to add contraceptive coverage to an insurance plan.
It's a cost-neutral coverage provision. But why couldn't -- So the only -- -- you just have -- why couldn't you just have written the rule to cover only those who have objections to the existing accommodation? In other words, those who have these complicity-based beliefs that the Little Sisters have? Well, because, Your Honor, I think, here, there's no reason to think anybody would do what you're suggesting. And the original burden stems from the contraceptive mandate itself.
And so I guess what I would point to is cases like Ricci against DeStefano, which, at the very least, if you don't accept my broader argument, give the government flexibility in the face of potentially competing statutory obligations. That's the case where the Court said -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? General, if you just continue, I'd like to hear the rest of your answer. Sure.
I was focusing on Ricci against DeStefano, which I think gives the government flexibility when it's facing potentially competing obligations. That's the case where the Court said that an employer could violate Title VII's disparate treatment provision if it had a substantial -- substantial grounds for believing it would otherwise be violating Title VII's disparate impact provision.
It's the way the Court reconciles statutes that put parties in the -- the -- the -- in the place of having to decide whether to violate one at the expense of the other. And, here, I think we at the very least have a strong basis for believing that the prior regime violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and that gives us the discretion to adopt a traditional exemption, which, after all, is the type -- is the way that the governments have traditionally accommodated religious beliefs. And I think that's particularly clear here since, one, RFRA both applies to and supersedes the ACA, and, two, even if you don't think that the ACA authorizes exemptions, even though we think that they -- it does, there's nothing in the ACA that prohibits exemptions. Thank you, General. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, General Francisco. Good morning, Your Honor. Your colleague on the other side says the text and structure of the ACA make plain that Congress delegated HRSA authority to oversee guidelines defining what preventive services for women must be covered, not who must cover them. Can you respond to that argument? Yes, Your Honor. Respectfully, that is not what the ACA says.
Section 13(a)(4) says that employers have to provide whatever coverage HRSA itself provides for and supports. Here, HRSA does not provide for and support coverage by the small number of employers with conscientious objections, but it does provide for and support coverage by everybody else. So I think our position follows plainly from the plain text of 13(a)(4) itself, whereas, respectfully, I think my friend's position on the other side is irreconcilable with that statutory text.
They're trying to put sentences into that text that simply do not exist. Thank you, General. Mr. Clement? Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: From the very beginning, the government recognized that its contraceptive mandate implicated deeply-held religious beliefs, and so it exempted churches and some religious orders. And Congress recognized that the mandate was not some sort of categorical imperative that demanded universal compliance, and so it exempted tens of millions of employees under grandfathered plans.
Thus, from the very beginning, the government's refusal to exempt the Little Sisters from the mandate and its massive penalties has posed a glaring RFRA problem. The federal government finally got the message and exempted the Little Sisters.
That exemption remedied the RFRA violation and followed the best of our traditions. Nonetheless, the Third Circuit invalidated it by concluding that the regulatory accommodation satisfied RFRA and the government was powerless to go further. That decision is doubly flawed as the regulatory mechanism plainly violates RFRA and RFRA does not impose a rule of parsimony or limit the government to the least accommodating alternative. The Third Circuit's reasoning was plainly mistaken as to the substantial burden analysis as its reasoning really cannot be squared with this Court's decision in Hobby Lobby.
After all, the penalties that enforce the mandate here are the exact same penalties that -- that underlie the basic contraceptive mandate in the Hobby Lobby decision itself. And so, when the government imposes an -- a -- a burden on religion by telling the Little Sisters that they have to comply with the mandate or the accommodation or else, when the ""or else"" is massive penalties, that plainly provides a substantial burden on religious exercise. At the same time, the compelling interest analysis also works in favor of the Little Sisters for two basic reasons.
First, the government has shown its ability to exempt churches and other religious orders from the very beginning, and then, secondly, in the grandfathered plan's exemption, the government has shown its ability to exempt tens of millions of employees who do not even have religious objections but only object or are only exempted for reasons of administrative convenience. Mr. Clement, your client, the Little Sisters, do not object to their employees having coverage for contraceptive services, right? They -- no, the Little Sisters don't have any objection if their employees receive those services from some other means.
Their objection essentially is to having their plan hijacked and being forced to provide those services through their own plan and plan infrastructure. So, if you have a situation where the certification was not necessary, in other words, the government -- the government finds out that the employees do not have contraceptive coverage through some other means, and you do not have the hijacking problem that you referred to because the insurance coverer would not provide the services through the Little Sisters' plan but could provide them directly to the employees, then why isn't that sort of accommodation sufficient? I -- I didn't understand the problem at the time of Zubik, and I'm not sure I understand it now. Well, I don't think we would have an objection to simply objecting to the government and then, if the government has some way to provide the contraception services independently of us and our plans, we've never had an objection to that. But the government has insisted throughout this whole process that we not just be able to have an opt-out form, an objection form, but that that same form serve as a permission slip to allow the government to track down PPAs and others to provide services through our plans.
And that's always been the gravamen of our objection.
It's never been an objection to objecting itself. Well, the problem is that neither side in this debate wants the accommodation to work.
The one side doesn't want it to work because they want to say the mandate is required, and the other side doesn't want it to work because they want to impose the mandate. Is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences? I -- Mr. Chief Justice, in the wake of the Zubik remand order, there was a lot of back and forth between the religious objector -- objectors and the government, and I don't think that there really was a mechanism to find sort of some third way because the government has always insisted on seamless coverage, with seamless, essentially, being a synonym through -- for through the Little Sisters' plans. Thank you, counsel. And as long as they insisted on -- Justice Thomas? Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Clement, the -- the -- I'd like you to have an opportunity to comment on the questionable standing of the states in this case, as well as the proliferation of national -- nationwide injunctions, such as the one in this case. Certainly, Justice Thomas.
I guess I would say one thing about each of those issues. At this juncture, as long as Massachusetts against EPA remains good law, we don't really have an objection to the states' standing.
But I think their standing has to depend on that precedent because, as General Francisco alluded to, throughout this litigation, they have not been able to identify even a single person who would lose coverage in such a way that it would increase the burdens for the state and -- Pennsylvania and New Jersey. So the only way that they can have standing in this case is if they're excused from the requirement of being able to identify specific individuals who are harmed and increase their burdens.
And I think there's a reading of Massachusetts against EPA that says that's okay, but that is certainly the absolute outer standing -- outer limit of -- of standing to be sure. With respect to the nationwide injunctions, that's an issue where I think that it's particularly inappropriate to have a nationwide injunction in a case like this.
The one thing we should have learned from years of litigation over the Affordable Care Act and its contraceptive mandate in particular is that the courts do not come to uniform decisions in this area, and sometimes the majority view in the circuit courts is rejected by this Court. And so, under those circumstances in particular, for a single district court judge to think that he or she has a monopoly on the reasoning here and should impose a remedy that affects people across the nation seems to me to be very imprudent and not something that's consistent with equity practice or really just sort of good practice and the way that our judicial system works since it really depends on having the circuits potentially look at these issues independently, when they divide, this Court takes review, and these nationwide injunctions short-circuit all of that and put enormous pressure on this Court, and it forces this Court to hear cases in emergency postures and -- and -- and -- and the rest. Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg? I would ask Mr. Clement the same question I asked the government.
The -- at the end of the day, the government is throwing to the wind the women's entitlement to seamless, no cost to them.
It is requiring those women to pay for contraceptive services if they can -- first, they would have to go search for a government plan, and, if it turns out, as it will for many of them, that there is no government -- other plan that covers them, then they're not covered. And the only way they can get these contraceptive services is to pay for them out of pocket, precisely what Congress did not want to happen in the Affordable Care Act. So this idea that the balance has to be all for the Little Sisters-type organizations and not at all for the women just seems to me to rub against what is our history of accommodation, of tolerance, of respect for divergent views. Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would -- I would say two things in response. First, I would echo what the Solicitor General said in pointing out that Congress itself did not even specify that contraceptions would be included in the preventative health mandate. And Congress went further and said with respect to grandfathered plans, that there were other mandates in the Affordable Care Act, like coverage for people up to age 26 and preexisting conditions, that they were going to impose even on grandfathered plans, but they didn't impose the preventative mandate. So Congress itself recognized that tens of millions of employees could be in the same position as employees of the Little Sisters of the Poor even though there's no religious objection there whatsoever. And I think the clear teaching of RFRA is that when you're going to give those kind of exceptions to people for secular reasons, then you need to give those kind of exceptions to religious believers.
And -- Thank you, counsel. Justice -- Justice Breyer? I have two reactions. One, of course, is that the point of the religious clauses is to try to work out accommodations, because they can be some of the most difficult to resolve disputes and they can substitute a kind of hostility for harmony. So, from that point of view, I really repeat, if there's anything you want to add, the Chief Justice's question.
I don't understand why this can't be worked out.
But, if it can't, from what's been said so far, it seems to me the proper legal box to work it out in is whether this particular rule is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. After all, the religious groups say they have a real basis in objection.
And the other say: Look, these are women who will be hurt, who have no religious objection.
And, moreover, the insurance companies will be hurt because it will raise costs.
And, moreover, the taxpayers who pay for it will be hurt. Now you have interests on both sides. The question is whether this is a reasonable effort to accommodate.
And that, I think, is arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, but that is the one thing that isn't argued before us in these briefs or in this appeal. So what do I do? So, Justice Breyer, I think you're absolutely right that that is not the nature of the objection that's been raised by the other side.
They haven't said, for example, yeah, this exemption might be okay if it were limited to the Little Sisters and others who object to the accommodation, but they went too far. That is not the nature of the challenge.
They haven't brought that kind of substantive APA challenge.
So I think what you would do is you would reject the challenge that is before you, because I don't think any of the grounds that have been litigated before you are valid, and you could make clear in your opinion that if somebody down the road has an objection to the scope of the exemption, say they work for a for-profit company and with respect to that for-profit company, they're not getting their services and they think that's because the APA -- because the -- the rule here is too broad, that would be a separate APA challenge that I don't think rejecting the challenge here would foreclose. So I think that's the -- the path forward. Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito? Mr. Clement, I certainly agree with my colleagues that our best tradition in this area is to accommodate diverse religious views.
So I want to ask you about the interests that are involved here. On the one hand, what would the Little Sisters feel compelled to do if they lose this case and they are told you must provide this coverage through your plan? And, on the other side, I want to ask you, since this has now been going on for some period of time, whether you have identified the number of women who work for the Little Sisters who want contraceptives, but they can't get them through their employer's plan or through the insurance plan of a family member or a government program and can't easily afford to purchase them on their own. So, Justice Alito, on both questions, first, the Little Sisters believe that complying with this mandate is simply inconsistent with their faith.
And so, if this burden is imposed on them, they will have to reconfigure their operations. One of the anomalies here is that the government, from the beginning, has exempted religious orders, but they refuse -- if they -- if they stick to their knitting and do only religious services, but if, on the other hand, they -- they do what the Little Sisters do, which is go out and provide care for the elderly poor and for the sick, then they don't qualify for the exemption. And so maybe the Little Sisters will have to reconfigure their operations, but there's just nothing that they can do that will allow them to come into compliance with the plan, and so -- with -- with the government's mandate. And -- and I think that's what Congress had in mind with RFRA, because they understood that when people are faced with a government obligation that their religion absolutely forbids them to comply with, that's something that the government should try to avoid at all costs. To answer the second part of your question just quickly, the Little Sisters have never complied with the mandate throughout this entire litigation, and so what that means is two things. One, no one will lose their coverage that they have now if the Little Sisters are given this exemption, and, two, throughout that process, we have not heard of even a single employee who views this as a problem, presumably because many of these employees, even if they're not Catholic, because the Little Sisters hires on a non-discriminatory basis, but they've come to work for the Little Sisters understanding the mission of the Little Sisters, and I don't think they would really want to put the Little Sisters in the position that you alluded to of maybe having to stop serving the elderly poor. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Mr. Clement, assume that the government tomorrow passes a law that says every insurance company must reimburse every policyholder they have for COVID-19 vaccine.
They say nothing about whether it's in their policy or not.
If someone has a religious objection, they say they can be exempted from it.
But you, insurance carrier, must pay for anyone who submits, who has a policy with you, for anyone who submits for a COVID-19 vaccine. Can the employer object to pay through that policy? So, Justice Sotomayor, I think the answer is no, and if -- I'd like to explain kind of how I would work through that. Mr. Clement, exactly the same rules that apply here to contraceptives, meaning all they have to do is tell the government that they object to vaccines -- and, by the way, we both know there are religious objectors who object to vaccines -- and that they don't want their plans to be complicit in providing vaccines. So, Justice Sotomayor -- Provided for -- -- I -- I wanted to elaborate on my answer and kind of explain, you know, how the hypo is a little bit different than the way things work.
As I understood the hypo, the government obligation was imposed directly on the insurers, so I don't think the employers could object at all. Now I think an employer -- an insurer that has a sincere religious objection to providing the coverage, say like the Christian Brothers, they might be able to object.
I don't think they actually have that objection, to be clear, but they could in theory.
If they objected to providing compensation for that coverage, they could object.
And I think it probably would be a substantial burden.
In the context of COVID-19, I think that you might strike the -- the government might be able to carry its burden under strict scrutiny, but I think that would be the way to think through that hypothetical. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Good morning, Mr. Clement.
I'd like to start by asking you about a -- a response that you gave to the Chief Justice, because you said there that you had no objection to objecting, the Little Sisters didn't, and I've taken that to be your consistent position throughout the litigation. But what if an employer did have an objection to objecting? In other words, had an even more, say, extended under -- view of complicity so that he thought that -- the employer thought that extending itself made him complicit because it led to a sort of chain reaction whereby the employees were eventually going to get coverage. What -- what would you say about that? So, Justice Kagan, I think it would depend on additional factors like whether the government enforced its requirement of an objection with the same massive penalties we have here. If they did, then I think the way to think about that particular sort of objection would be that if that objection is sort of for -- if an objection is forbidden by the person's religious beliefs, sincerely held, and the government enforces with a massive penalty, then there is a substantial burden. And then the analysis would shift to the compelling interest, least restrictive alternatives test.
In most cases, I think the government would be able to submit or sustain its requirement of at least having an objection. The irony is this might be the one context where they can't, because they've never required the churches, the religious auxiliaries, the other orders that stick to their knitting and engage in only religious activities, they've never had to even object.
They're just -- Right, but that would suggest -- -- exempt -- -- that even in that case where objecting to objecting is the only thing, that you would think that the employer would prevail? I think the employer -- You know, I guess that -- 44:23-- would have a -- -- would make all the same arguments, right, you know, that women can get contraceptive coverage elsewhere and there are other exemptions to this scheme, so the employer would prevail even if it were only objecting to objecting? I think that's right, Justice Kagan, but just to be clear, I think that has to do with the way that the government has operated this whole program.
Since they've never required the churches or the other religious orders or the grandfathered plans to object, I think that puts the government in a difficult position in this hypothetical situation. But assuming that at the outset -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? -- my client has never made that objection. Justice Gorsuch? Mr. Clement, a major feature of the opinion below and the arguments in the briefs at least was that the government had failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the APA. And I -- I -- I -- I didn't want that major component of the case to go unaddressed today.
I want to give you a chance to respond to that. Thank you, Justice Gorsuch.
I think, on the APA, there are a number of different ways to come out differently from the way that the Third Circuit analyzed this issue.
We obviously think the Third Circuit erred. In some ways, the most straightforward way is to just find that the good cause standard or exception for the original IFR here was satisfied.
And we think that the good cause standard here was satisfied for the same reasons that the government had good cause, for example, to make immediately effective moderations in light of this Court's order in the Wheaton College case. And we think that, likewise, the -- my friends on the other side say there was good cause for the original exemptions and the like in the mandate because they needed to make changes quickly for additional -- for the upcoming plan years. And we think all of those same things apply here.
And then, of course, another way to rule against the Third Circuit on that issue is to recognize that there's specific statutory authority here to promulgate IFRs for benefit plans, which probably recognizes the fact that these benefit plans will often have to be changed in ways that will affect sort of future plan years, and so changes made -- need to be made very quickly. But the third way, of course, to reject the reasoning of the Third Circuit is -- is to say, even if there was some sort of original sin in the promulgation of the IFRs, it was cured by the notice and comment that actually took place subsequently. And one feature of the Third Circuit opinion that I just want to draw attention to is the Third Circuit never faulted the government for responding to the thousands and thousands and thousands of comments it got in any kind of insufficient way. So the government, I think, on this record has complied with all of the textual requirements of the APA procedurally, and yet they've still been found to -- to be out of compliance based on an atextual test. Thank you, counsel. I could be -- Justice -- Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Clement.
I want to follow up on Justice Kagan's question about the objection to objecting.
I had thought that would be litigated, thought out under the least restrictive alternative prong of RFRA, and the government might be able to argue that there's no less restrictive alternative available in that situation. You might disagree and try to identify a less restrictive alternative, but I had thought that's where it would be litigated.
Is that correct or not? I -- I -- I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that's exactly where it would be litigated.
And I think why -- again, we're talking about a hypothetical that doesn't arise for my clients, but I think where I might come out differently from you on the least restrictive alternatives analysis is to point to the fact that the church exemption and the grandfathered plans exemption have always worked quite well without requiring there to be any kind of formal objection registered. And so it does seem to me that those are essentially other ways that the government has been able to comply. And then I guess the other question, of course, is if we're in the realm where the government itself has through something like the final rule alleviated the obligation even to have an objection, I'm not even sure this question we're talking about would arise. Right.
No, I -- I -- I understand that, and that's -- that's what I expected your argument to be in that context. Second question just to follow up on Justice Breyer on the arbitrary and capricious test, the exercise of discretion must be reasonable, what are the limits that you would identify to the government's discretion, if any? So I would identify all of the limits that General Francisco alluded to and one more.
One thing I think is a little bit artificial here about the position of the other side is they want you to look at the ACA and RFRA as if they're siloed and they don't interface.
But, of course, they do. And there's an obligation on HRSA to take into account RFRA, as well as its authority under the ACA.
And so it seems to me that an exemption for religion -- that of the kind that's in the final rule here, I think, is going to be insulated from an arbitrary and capricious challenge in a way that's exempting, say, just large employers or employers incorporated in Delaware. I think all of those would be irrational and -- and arbitrary and capricious under the -- under the APA.
But, here, the -- the agency has complied with RFRA, consistent with its authority under the ACA, which seems to give it a particularly strong case for its actions here to not have been arbitrary and capricious. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fischer. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The moral and religious exemption rules rest on three sweeping assertions of agency authority.
First, the agencies twist a narrow delegation that allows the Health Resources and Services Administration to decide which preventive services insurers must cover under the Women's Health Amendment into a grant of authority so broad it allows them to permit virtually any employer or college to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage entirely, including for reasons as amorphous as vaguely defined moral beliefs. Second, the agencies claim that RFRA, a statute that limits government action, affirmatively authorizes them to permit employers to deny women their rights to contraceptive coverage even in the absence of a RFRA violation in the first place. As many of the questions have reflected, the prior rules struck a balance that permitted objecting employers to opt out but still allowed their female employees to receive contraceptive coverage.
These rules, however, exempt such employers altogether even if they had no objection to this prior accommodation. And these rules also allow for the first time publicly traded companies to claim the same exemption, despite the agencies' admission that no such company has ever requested one. And, third, the agencies claim they were justified in issuing these sweeping new rules without first putting out a proposal and seeking comment, as the APA requires.
They advance an interpretation of the APA that is inconsistent with its text and purpose and that would effectively write the requirement of pre-promulgation notice and comment out of the statute. Now, in addition, the agencies also challenge to -- challenge the scope of the preliminary relief entered below and, in so doing, they advance the novel claim that federal courts simply lack the authority to invalidate unlawful agency regulations in their entirety. In isolation, the agency's arguments are incorrect.
But taken together, stretching a narrow delegation well beyond its limits, finding broad affirmative rulemaking authority in a statute that doesn't provide it, bypass -- bypassing prior notice and comment where the APA requires it, and seeking to vastly curtail the Court's authority to invalidate unlawful agency action, taken together, these arguments make apparent that what this case is about is not the resolution of a long-running dispute but rather the assertion of vast agency authority at the expense of Congress and the courts. Thank you, counsel.
I have a question.
There was a hypothetical in one of the amicus briefs that I thought was pretty good and I haven't heard an answer to yet, and that's -- say you have a couple going out to dinner, and they tell the baby-sitter, well, the children have to do chores, you know, you decide which ones. I think everybody would agree that -- that that includes the authority to say not only that we have to do the dishes and sweep the floors, but, Tommy, you sweep -- you -- you do the dishes, and, Sally, you sweep the floors, and not the assumption that each child would have to do each chore. And, here, your argument about the ACA statute is that it gives HHS the authority to specify which services have to be provided but does not give them the authority to make determinations about who has to provide which, but, instead, imply that every employer has to provide everyone.
So what do you -- Yes, Your Honor. -- what -- what's your answer do that? Mr. Chief Justice, our answer is that that is the only reasonable reading of the text of the Women's Health Amendment.
The ""who must provide"" is answered by the beginning of 13(a).
It says, ""A group health plan and health insurance issuer offering individual health insurance coverage shall at a minimum provide coverage for, and shall not impose any cost-sharing requirements for."" Now ""shall"" is mandatory, as this Court recently acknowledged again in the -- the cost-sharing case recently dealing with the ACA. Below that language, there are four separate categories of services to be covered.
Nobody disputes that the first three are mandatory, that all covered insurers must cover the first three. The only dispute comes in the fourth one, which is, with respect to women, such additional preventive care as provided for in comprehensive guidelines. And in the hypothetical that -- that Your Honor referred to, which I believe is in the -- the Texas amicus brief, they modified the language of this requirement by taking out the ""such additional"" language.
That language is key because it answers the question of what services are insurers to provide. Well, with respect to women, it is such additional preventive care and screenings as provided for in comprehensive guidelines.
So ""as provided for"" clearly modifies ""such additional care and screenings."" It doesn't go beyond that in giving -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? General, just a brief question that's a little different. I'm interested in your view on standing.
And with your argument for standing in this case, that challenge a regulation, the government's regulation that might impact your costs, the state's costs, seems to suggest that any time there's a rule change at the federal level that affects you, you would have standing. And then that, again, following this case to its remedy of a nationwide injunction, would suggest that in these sorts of cases, a nationwide injunction would be appropriate. I'd like you to have -- to comment on that.
It seems to be somewhat problematic and to suggest that there's a problem with both standing and nationwide injunctions if they are this easy to -- to get. Thank you, Your Honor. And to -- to be clear, we have to satisfy standing requirements just as any other litigant has to show standing.
And we did in this case by showing that the rules would impose costs on Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and that is in some way sort of the most basic type of injury that all parties, not just states, allege in showing harm. Now my friend on the other side referred to Massachusetts versus EPA, which certainly recognizes that states have a special place in our constitutional order.
However, we still demonstrated that based on the government's own estimates of the number of women affected, these rules would impose direct costs on us. And with respect to the question about nationwide injunctions, first of all, I want to stress that we're here in a preliminary posture. We were granted a preliminary injunction.
We've moved for summary judgment.
The government requested that the case be stayed.
The district court granted that.
We could have the case wrapped up now. The analysis with respect to nationwide injunctions is different, we submit, in the context of an APA challenge, where the ultimate remedy available is that the Court shall set aside a rule that is invalid. If courts sort of were able to slice and dice rules and say, well, agency, you can enforce this with this person, but it stays in effect as to everybody else, the result really would be regulatory chaos. So where a challenge is brought under the APA to a regulation, taking account of that final remedy that's available, granting preliminary relief on a nationwide basis is appropriate. It was also appropriate here because the district court found in a very thorough, very well-reasoned discussion that acknowledged Your Honor's concerns, as expressed about nationwide injunctions, discussed this idea that -- that there's significant cross-border harms here that simply couldn't be addressed in a more narrow injunction. Thank -- And -- -- you.
The -- it would seem, though, that -- that, ultimately, you could get, if that's the argument, nationwide injunctions with virtually any regulatory change. I don't believe that's the case, Your Honor.
I would -- I would think that there are many regulations that are not going to impose costs on the states directly or indirectly. And -- and, certainly, in a nationwide injunction context, I think it would still depend on the specifics of the rule being challenged and the nature of the harm that the challengers are alleging. And -- and as I again indicated, the -- the district court really took account of all these concerns, talked about the need for percolation among the circuit courts, and -- and acknowledged, frankly, in -- in plain terms that fashioning preliminary relief is an imperfect science, that district courts try their best and they're reviewed for the abuse of discretion standard.
I think that -- I don't mean to cut you off -- -- is what -- -- but one -- I do want to get in one question about when the APA was adopted, do you think there were such things as nationwide injunctions, or were they handled on a case-by-case basis? Your Honor, I believe there is a history, certainly, of relief going beyond -- beyond the parties to a case.
Whether they were classified as nationwide injunctions is difficult to say.
And I think this is dealt with very well by the various amicus briefs. But I also think that in passing the APA, Congress provided a very specific remedy. And as Your Honor stated in the -- the travel ban case, you know, authority for a nationwide injunction has to come from either the Constitution or a statute. Well, the APA here is the authority that we would allege -- we argue that the -- the basis for this injunction comes from.
It says, as a final remedy, courts shall set aside improper agency action, and that it permits agencies or permits courts to stay agency action, as this Court did a few years ago in the Clean Power Plan case.
It permits better injunctions.
It permits them to postpone the effective date. And many of those remedies suggest going -- relief going to the rule in its entirety. Thank you -- So I think, here, the text -- -- counsel. Justice Ginsburg? Let's see.
So I -- I just remain troubled by the complete abandonment of the Congress's interest in saving women costs.
This is going to force costs on the women that Congress wanted to provide free coverage for.
I've never seen any of our prior decisions suggest that those interests could be thrown to the wind and the women could be left to their own resources to cover themselves, to get policies that would cover them for these contraceptive services at -- at a premium to them. Your Honor, that is absolutely correct.
And I think it's important to remember just how broad these rules are. First of all, there are two rules that we're dealing with.
One that we haven't talked about as much is the moral rule that simply says an employer with a moral objection to providing contraception can be completely exempted. The district court noted this could, in theory, allow an employer that objects to women in the workforce, for instance, to remove itself from providing contraception. And with respect to the religious exemption, you know, there are certain key features that really show how broad this is. First of all, it eliminates the accommodation as a mandatory requirement.
So even for, for instance, all the various plaintiffs in the Hobby Lobby cases that this Court recognized were perfectly fine with the accommodation, they are now exempt. And I disagree with my friend's conclusion that they're unlikely to take advantage of the exemption, because these are entities that object to contraception.
They made that clear.
They were simply fine with complying with the accommodation.
So I think it's likely that many of them will, in fact, opt out. In addition, as I mentioned, this applies -- Where is the -- -- to publicly traded -- -- where is the moral -- where would the moral exemption come from? That doesn't seem to come from -- So it -- it does not -- they do not rely on RFRA for the moral exemption.
They claim authority under 300gg-13, under the ACA's women's health amendment, for the moral exemption.
And as we have argued and as -- as the courts below found, that statute simply doesn't support the conclusion that they can create whatever exceptions they want. If their reading were correct, there would be no limits to what HRSA could do, other than arbitrary and capricious review.
HRSA could decide to eliminate the no cost sharing requirement, it could decide that, you know, certain services really don't need to be covered at all, even if they're in -- you know, even if they're widely recognized as preventive services.
It could exempt whole classes of employers for reasons having nothing to do with the reasons here. So our reading, we submit, is a far better one.
And, frankly, we have to remember we're talking about the Health Resources and Services Administration.
It's really unlikely that Congress would have delegated to that organization authority to create broad religious and moral objections -- exemptions, given that they have no expertise in that area. Justice Breyer? Two related questions.
Thank you. One is, as you know, the statute says that they have to provide additional preventive care as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Well, read that and you have at least some ambiguity.
So my question is really, given your argument and given what may well be ambiguity at least in the statute, why didn't you make the argument, it's arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion? You're saying it's too broad, you're saying it'll hurt women, you -- you -- you know, you -- you point out that it'll raise healthcare costs and a whole lot of things. And -- and the government has things to reply to that.
But why isn't that the proper legal box? That's my first -- my related question is, if you were to let a district court get at that issue, that district judge might try to reach an accommodation by saying: Have you read -- which you have -- the brief of Phyllis Borzi and Daniel Maguire? And it points out that the prior rule didn't pirate -- did not pirate the health plan of Little Sisters. And if they think it did, and you think it didn't, well, my goodness, you should be able to monkey with it in some way so that everybody reluctantly agrees that it's okay. All right.
Now those are advantages I see of going back and making a different kind of argument, put all your arguments in a different legal box.
So why not? So, Your Honor, I -- I don't disagree with any of that.
I do think the rules are additionally arbitrary and capricious, and we did raise that argument in our complaint. We also argued, I think correctly, that they exceeded -- the statutory authority cited by the agencies did not support the rules. And since we won on that basis, there was no need to go any further and say, well, if they had the authority, did they exercise it correctly? I disagree also with Your Honor's suggestion that the language is ambiguous.
I think, as we explained, the use of the word ""supported"" in context reflects similar language in paragraph 3 immediately preceding.
And all that refers to is the fact that the guidelines in paragraph 3, which are the -- the bright horizons guidelines, were funded by HRSA but actually conducted or produced by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
So HRSA supports those guidelines by contracting, by funding.
And I think Congress borrowed that language. And the as provided for, as I -- as I indicated, refers back to such additional preventive care and screenings.
So we don't think there's an argument as to ambiguity. Now, as to whether there could be a resolution, I certainly would hope that there is.
As the Borzi and Maguire brief explains, the government, the prior administration, we do not believe that these plans are being hijacked. And to be clear, we brought this suit against the federal government.
We have not challenged the Little Sisters.
We have not challenged their Colorado injunction.
They and all the other parties to Zubik are protected by injunctions and do not have to comply with the contraceptive mandate no matter what happens in this case. But could there be a resolution to the narrow set of cases out there? I would hope so. But the fact that there was this ongoing dispute doesn't justify jettisoning the accommodation for everyone else, bringing in publicly traded companies certainly doesn't justify the moral rule.
And those, I think, are the -- the most egregious examples of simply how overbroad this -- these two regulations are. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Justice Alito? Mr. Fischer, you say that the Affordable Care Act does not allow the government to make any exceptions to the contraceptive mandate to accommodate religious objections. Now, if that's true, the original exemption for churches, their auxiliaries, and conventions of churches, which was established by the prior administration, violated the Affordable Care Act.
But you come back and say that was required to comply with a First Amendment church autonomy doctrine. And what I'd like you to explain is your understanding of the scope of that doctrine.
And let's take as an example a woman who works for a church in an entirely secular capacity.
Let's say a woman who cleans church property. Under your understanding of this religious autonomy doctrine, does that mean that that employment relationship is entirely off limits for any federal regulation, for example, or any state regulation? For example, from Title VII's prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Equal Pay Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act? Your Honor, we would not agree with that conclusion that individuals in entirely secular positions are exempt from all those requirements under the church autonomy doctrine. What we have argued is that -- I don't mean to interrupt you, but you do say that it would violate the First Amendment to require the church to provide contraceptive coverage for that woman? Your Honor, what we are arguing is that there is a basis in the First Amendment for exempting churches in some way, that, certainly, there is a core of church autonomy that -- that agencies in implementing federal law must protect. Well, in some way as to the provision of insurance coverage for contraceptives.
I took your argument to mean the First Amendment would prohibit the government from requiring a church to provide that. And what I wanted to -- Certainly, as to -- as to ministers, certainly. Pardon me? Do I -- I hadn't finished what I wanted -- As to ministers, certainly.
That -- that is correct, but -- but I would add we are not arguing necessarily that the prior administration got everything right in the details.
There have been arguments on both sides that perhaps the churches have to -- Mr. Fischer, I'm not talking about the details.
I'm talking about exempting a secular employee of a church from receiving the contraceptive coverage.
Your argument has to be that's required by the First Amendment, or you have to say -- maybe this is your position -- that the original church exemption is contrary to the Affordable Care Act. That is not our position.
We think that the original church exemption was supported by the afford -- supported by the First Amendment.
We don't agree it was supported by the Affordable Care Act.
We -- we think the prior administration was wrong in -- All right.
So I really would appreciate your answering my question.
If the First Amendment requires an exemption for the provision of contraceptive coverage, why would it not also require an exemption for all of the other regulations that I mentioned? Certainly, in a core -- in the core ministerial functions, it does.
We don't dispute that. I think the question is whether -- I'm not talking about a minister.
I'm talking about a woman who cleans the church. Exactly.
And our position there is I don't think it's necessarily the case that the first -- that the First Amendment required that the church exemption be as broad as it was.
However, given the realities of insurance and the need for ERISA plans to be consistent, the prior administration made a decision that they were going to apply to all employees of churches. We don't take issue with that, even if that went a little bit broader than what the First Amendment requires, which is protecting individuals in ministerial functions and the church's autonomy with respect to those individuals. That's a far cry from what they did in these rules, which goes well beyond the core of the protection that the First Amendment requires or that RFRA requires. If I could ask one other question.
Explain to me why the Third Circuit's analysis of the question of substantial burden is not squarely inconsistent with our reasoning in Hobby Lobby. So the -- Hobby Lobby held that if a person sincerely believes that it is immoral to perform an act that has the effect of enabling another person to commit an immoral act, a federal court does not have the right to say that this person is wrong on the question of moral complicity.
That's precisely the situation here. Reading the Third Circuit's discussion of the substantial burden question, I wondered whether they had read that part of the Hobby Lobby decision. So, in Hobby Lobby, the question was essentially the degree of attenuation between providing coverage and utilizing the contraceptive care.
And the -- the Court rightly concluded that the fact that others were involved didn't really matter. Here, the Court said essentially that where an objection -- it depends on the operation of the law.
And, here, it is -- it is the legal requirements that are shifting the burden to the insurer or the third-party administrator. Courts still have a duty to inquire as to what the law actually requires of the objector, and the -- the nature of the objection was that filling out this form made them complicit in providing contraception.
They did not object to the idea of filling out a form stating their objection by itself.
They objected to what flowed from the form. And the Third Circuit, consistent with the seven other circuits that reached the same conclusion prior to Zubik, concluded that in that situation, a court can look at what's actually being required of the objector.
And -- and this finds support in the Bowen v. Roy case, where notwithstanding the fact that applying for food stamps would have triggered the government utilizing the daughter's Social Security number, which was the nature of the objection, HHS still said that -- you know, essentially, that does not raise a cognizable First Amendment claim -- But you're -- you're arguing that -- -- because it was -- -- the Little Sisters didn't understand what the law required them to do or didn't understand the significance of what the law required them to do? Not at all.
We are simply arguing that they have not -- Which of those -- which of those things is it? They didn't understand what the law required them to do? No, we're not saying that at all.
We're saying that the harm they've alleged is not a legally cognizable substantial burden.
The courts do not -- You're saying they're wrong in their -- their understanding of moral complicity is wrong? No, we're not saying that at all.
We do not challenge their view of moral complicity.
What we do challenge is whether that -- what they are saying rises to the level of a substantial burden, which is ultimately a legal test.
And Congress included the word ""substantial"" for a reason, because it recognized that not every law that had an effect on religion necessarily should be subject to strict scrutiny. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, going back to the Chief Justice's example a second, clearly, we understand that there's inherent power to share the chores between the two children, correct? However -- Yes, I think -- -- if the baby-sitter decides, ahh, I just disagree with the mom, I'm not going to have either of them do anything, would that be contrary to the instructions that the law gave? That -- that certainly would be, Your Honor. All right. I would agree with that. So let's talk about this situation.
Here, the government's exemption is not merely saying to the Little Sisters you don't have to provide coverage, whether it's you or a church or anyone else, but we're not going to permit -- we're also saying that your insurance policies, independent actors, who have a legal obligation to pay for the contraceptives that employees use, that they don't have to do it either. You're objecting to that second part of the exemption, aren't you? So that is correct as a general matter.
I just want to make one specific point, which is that -- Your Honor mentioned the Little Sisters.
Their -- their insurance carrier stated that it will not provide contraception no matter what.
Or their -- their health plan.
And because it's a church plan exempt from ERISA, the government cannot enforce it.
So, even if they didn't have their separate injunction, their employees would not receive contraception.
We're not trying to challenge that at all.
We're not trying to require -- Oh, oh -- -- them to provide coverage -- -- that -- that -- that's an interesting point.
I didn't know that.
So the Little Sisters' claim is actually moot here? So -- Well, that is why we argued -- that's why we argued that they lacked appellate standing, and the Third Circuit agreed. They -- they lack appellate standing because they don't have to provide it; neither does their insurance carrier, correct? That's correct, yes. And as -- And that -- -- a result of the injunction. -- has nothing -- that has nothing to do with this case, as I understood it -- well, no, that has to do with the church exemption.
Church plans do not have to provide -- under the law, they're not ERISA plans, so they don't have to provide coverage in this situation, correct? So where -- where the employer utilizes the accommodation, the government lacks a means of enforcing the requirements against church plans because they are exempt from ERISA.
So, if an employer utilizes the accommodation, the church plan can decide whether or not it wants to comply, and there's no penalty if the government -- if -- if it chooses not to comply. All right.
So tell me which part of the government's exemption you are actually challenging. So we -- we think the government's claims of authority for the exemptions were incorrect, but we -- we think that the most egregious parts of the rules are, first of all, the moral rule, which I -- I think is important to stress, that that's half of what's at issue in this case; the elimination of the accommodation as a mandatory requirement, including for companies that have no problem with it; the inclusion of publicly traded companies and large universities. And then two other points.
One, to claim this exemption, companies do not have to provide any specific notice to their employer -- employees.
They can simply, you know, include the fact that contraception isn't covered in all of the other ERISA notices that they mail out. They don't have to say specifically we have this objection.
We are not providing coverage. And, in addition, they don't have to show any sort of substantial burden.
They don't have to send anything to the government saying, we believe we're burdened for these reasons, we have these objections.
So there's really no way to evaluate, for instance, whether a company is sincere in the nature of its objections. That is part of the RFRA analysis. And, you know, as this Court acknowledged recently in -- in O Centro, RFRA creates a mechanism for courts to enforce this.
We don't dispute that agencies should take RFRA into account, but, ultimately, RFRA creates a judicial remedy, and courts -- and agencies should be looking to guidance from the courts and ensuring that when they do exempt people, there's at least a meaningful opportunity for judicial review of their decisions. So if -- Thank you -- Sorry. Justice Sotomayor, proceed. I guess the question I have is, the exemption as structured permits the insurance carriers not to provide coverage? Yes.
There -- there's no requirement that objecting entities utilize the accommodation.
It's completely optional. So they can simply claim the exemption and tell their insurer don't provide contraception.
And no entity has an obligation to -- to provide it at that point. And that is -- Thank you, counsel -- thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Good morning, Mr. Fischer.
I'd like to ask you -- Good morning, Your Honor. -- a few questions about what many people will think of as the most boring part of your argument, which is APA notice and comment, because I'm not quite sure I understand the argument, so let me just start by saying what you're doing is you're hypothesizing that there should be some significant difference between what happens and how a court reviews what happens when an agency works off of an interim final rule as opposed to when an agency works off a notice of proposed rulemaking. And I -- I guess the question is, why should there be any real difference between those two? So, Your Honor, I want to stress one aspect of our argument, which is that our argument hinges on whether the first rules, the 2017 rules, were themselves procedurally valid.
If they were valid, then the 2018 rules are procedurally valid as well. Okay.
So that's -- So -- -- but let me just make sure I understand it. Suppose that there were good cause for issuing an interim final rule.
At that point, if the agency then says, well, that's nice, we had good cause for doing this because we had an emergency, but now we're going to notice and comment, at that point, should the notice and comment be treated the exact same way as it would be if there were no good cause rule at all? Your Honor, if the agency has good cause to issue the rule with immediate effect, then the provisions of Section 553 simply don't apply. No, that's not right. And they're actually not -- I don't think that's right because the good cause can give you cause to act right now, but it -- it doesn't give you cause to act for 20 years without notice and comment.
So an agency could say we have good cause to act right now, but now we understand that we have to do a notice and comment proceeding because now, you know, there's something in place and we can take our time and do it. That's certainly true, Your Honor.
I apologize.
If the agency wishes to -- to modify the rule or take further comment, then, yes, it can go through the 553 process if -- if the good cause that -- that prompted the immediately effective rule no longer applies.
So that -- that's correct. Okay.
So, I mean, it not only can, but, in many cases, it has to. The -- That's right. -- good cause doesn't last forever.
So, in that kind of case, do you think that the standard is heightened when a court looks at -- at -- at -- at -- at this and says did they do notice and comment correctly? No, Your Honor.
In that -- in that case, the standard would be the same as it would be in any other APA case. Okay.
Because -- because I thought that your reasons for why the standard should be heightened would apply even when there was -- when the -- when the interim rule was valid, because, as I understand your reasons for thinking that the standard should be heightened, it's that the agency has kind of gotten psychologically used to the rule and -- and may be less willing to make departures from it. But -- but that applies even when the good cause rule is valid, doesn't it? It -- it does.
And I think that reflects a balance that Congress struck, recognizing that, in most cases, prior notice and comment is the most effective means of getting to a more informed decision. In some cases, that interest is trumped by the need for an immediately effective rule, so the benefits of notice and comment have to sort of give way a little bit so that the agency could act quickly. And -- but, here, where we believe the -- the good cause standard wasn't satisfied, the APA plainly requires the agency seek comment on a proposal -- And so -- -- and comment. Okay.
So I'm right in saying that this really does depend on whether the good cause requirement was satisfied in the first place? Yes, absolutely. Okay.
And then, as a remedy, you say we should just go back to the original rule, but the original rule was done in the exact same procedural manner. So how would that make anybody any happier? So there are a number of rules that have been implemented dealing with this.
A number of them went through full notice and comment.
In one case, there was an advance notice of prior rulemaking, of proposed rulemaking, an NPRM. In two cases since the women's health guidelines were issued and one time before, the prior administration did immediately go to an immediately effective rule.
They argued good cause.
In one instance, the D.C. Circuit upheld that finding.
In another instance, it was never, as far as we know, ruled on by any court. We think the arguments made were much stronger in those cases, and, regardless, to be litigating this question nine years after the fact simply doesn't make a lot of sense.
What we're saying is that the good cause claims made here by these agencies in these rules have to be evaluated on their own. And if -- if what the agency said here satisfies good cause, then agencies could always find good cause.
And the result would be -- and I think this is the most important part of our argument -- if what the agency did here is okay, every agency could say we're just going to issue a rule, make it effective immediately, claim good cause, and then take comment. And even if they lose on the good cause finding, they don't have to worry for long because, as soon as they've taken comment, they issued a new rule, then the rule will be immediately effective, and it will be as if there was no violation in the first place. And it's reasonable to think that agencies will -- will take their cues and will say, okay, well, we're going to take the risk and we're going to do that because, frankly, there really isn't much of a risk in the end if everything will be fine once they've taken comment and issued a new final rule. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Your Honor. Justice -- Justice Gorsuch? Good morning, counsel.
I'd like to turn back to where Justice Breyer left off on the substantive challenge, and I suppose the argument on the other side goes something like one could understand an arbitrary and capricious argument about the overbreadth, arguable overbreadth of these exemptions, but the challenge before us is whether the -- the agencies exceeded its statutory authority. And looking at the statute here, it's about as excessive a delegation of -- of statutory authority -- or not excessive -- expansive a delegation of statutory authority as one might -- might imagine.
It talks about comprehensive regulations. And when -- when an agency's given that kind of leeway, we normally think of comprehensive to include limitations, conditions, exceptions, as well as a general rule because there's no rule that doesn't have an exception. And then we look at the original accommodation, and at least some suggest that -- that that original accommodation to churches was consistent with that statutory delegation. And then you throw RFRA in the mix, and that's normally thought to trump any and inform any other existing statutory obligation. So what -- what do we do about that? I -- I think that's what Justice Breyer was trying to get at, and I guess I'm curious for a little further thought on it. So, yes, Your Honor, I think, if -- if the delegation is read the way the agencies would like to read it, then it is remarkably broad and I think would, frankly, raise non-delegation problems. I think the delegation is cabined by the fact that -- two things.
First of all, I think the structure of the section makes clear that Items 1, 2, 3, 4 are all simply categories of services. Even though, in identifying those services, it refers to comprehensive guidelines, what begins that paragraph 4 is, with respect to women, ""such additional preventive care and screenings."" And then the second point is that to the extent there might be -- Counsel, I -- I'm sorry to interrupt there, but -- and I -- I just want to understand how you read that because it does -- I -- I -- I heard that a few times, such additional preventive care and screenings, but then ... as provided for in these comprehensive guidelines. Can you explain how those two interact, I guess? Yes.
So -- so ""such,"" which -- which typically means, you know, in the manner to be indicated -- Yes. -- refers or sort of sets the stage for ""as provided for."" So, if you're asking the question, well, what additional preventive care and screenings must be provided, the answer is such -- so in the manner to be provided as provided for in the comprehensive guidelines. So all of that is answering the question of what additional preventive care and screenings are to be provided.
If you read ""as provided for"" as sort of applying to the entire section, sort of going back into subsection (a) and modifying those requirements, then you're sort of unmooring it from the way it's used in paragraph 4 and leaving ""such additional preventive care and screenings"" without any further explanation. And -- and, in addition, I think the other three categories provide some guidance and I think reasonably cabin the agency's authority. The other three paragraphs all refer to guidelines that already existed. So HRSA had the ability to look to those.
And those are all -- you know, there are no religious exemptions in those guidelines, there are no broad exemptions.
They're simply lists of services, lists of vaccinations that are required, other things. So where Congress lists several items, I think it's reasonable to conclude that Congress envisions that the agencies will operate or will exercise their discretion sort of in a similar manner in each instance.
And I think that's what was assumed here. But is -- is -- is -- is not part of that a function -- I think the argument is, A, we can't specify which preventative care and screenings will be provided or under what conditions and that any -- any provision of care is necessarily going to be conditioned and subject to all sorts of exceptions.
That's just the way the world works.
There's no rule without an exception. And -- and -- and toward that end, again, just drawing your attention back to the -- the accommodation for churches, many people have argued, and -- and, certainly, the prior administration did, that that was consistent with the statute, not -- not something imposed upon it from outside by the First Amendment. What do you say about that? Your Honor, so we disagree with the prior administration's conclusion that this section authorized the prior church exemption -- I understand that. -- and challenged and -- Let -- let -- let's suppose, though -- let's suppose, though, that that was correct.
And -- and -- and -- and I understand that's not your position. What would follow from that for this case? So, if -- if that were correct, then the agencies would have some discretion to create exemptions.
And then I think we would be in a position where we would evaluate these rules under arbitrary and capricious review.
And I think there are several problems with them, but we would not be in a world where the question of the agency's authority in the abstract was at issue. Okay.
And if I could turn quickly to one other point entirely, the substantial burden argument that Justice Alito raised.
And I -- I -- I understand your position.
I -- I -- I thought that there would be no substantial burden imposed by a requirement that they pay for contraceptive care.
Is -- is that correct? No, Your Honor, not at all.
I mean, that -- you know, if an employer objected to that requirement, there -- there would certainly be a -- a substantial burden. Okay.
All right, I misunderstood that colloquy then.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Your Honor. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Fischer. Good morning, Your Honor. I want to see your reaction to this way to think about the case, maybe picking up on Justice Breyer's question and -- and Justice Gorsuch's first question. As a number of my colleagues have pointed out, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Alito, Breyer and others, there are very strong interests on both sides here, which is what makes the case difficult, obviously.
There's religious liberty for the Little Sisters of the Poor and others.
There's the interest in ensuring women's access to healthcare and preventive services, which is also a critical interest.
So the question becomes, who decides? Who decides how to balance those interests? And the answer, of course, is Congress in the first interest -- instance. And -- and RFRA provides a backstop on that, but even beyond RFRA, in the ACA, Congress has delegated to the agency.
Okay, so we have a delegation from Congress to the agency, and -- which is common, and sometimes Congress delegates narrowly with narrow language, and sometimes it delegates broadly. And the rule of thumb I've always thought is courts should construe narrow language narrowly and broad language broadly. And this seems to be broad language, as Justice Thomas noted.
And when you have that kind of broad language, you're going to get different executive branches who are going to exercise their discretion within that broad language and balance the interests differently. And then the question is, what's the judicial role? And it seems to me the judicial role is not to put limits on the agency discretion that Congress has not put there. And then we're left, I think, as Justice Breyer said, with -- and -- and I want to get your reaction to this -- with the arbitrary and capricious test at the end of the day and just making sure that in exercising its discretion and balancing those interests, the agency didn't go outside the limits of reasonableness, which is a very deferential test.
It's not abdication, but it's deferential. Why isn't that the way to look at the case, and if we get down to the bottom line of is this reasonable, not maybe everyone's preferred choice but at least within the bounds of reasonable, why isn't this a reasonable way to balance it? So just get your reaction to all that. Thank you, Your Honor. So, on -- on that last point, the reason this is not a reasonable way of balancing is that the rules go well beyond when RFRA even arguably would require.
As we mentioned, for instance, companies that have no objection to accommodation are now wholly exempt. And however you interpret the Women's Health Amendment -- and -- and we -- we strenuously believe that it imposed a -- a mandatory duty on insurers to provide this coverage -- but, certainly, it would defeat the purpose of that amendment to say that women should not receive coverage if they work for an employer that objects to contraception generally but was willing to participate in the accommodation process or to note its objections so that they could still receive coverage. We also think there's -- that the exemption for publicly traded companies, in the absence of any evidence that any publicly traded companies requested one, goes well beyond.
We think the moral rule is so untethered from any reasonable standard that -- that it's certainly arbitrary and capricious. And we also think that -- that if we're in the RFRA world, that the way this exemption -- the way these exemptions are structured would really defeat any opportunity for scrutiny as to whether an employer claiming an objection has a sincere religious belief, whether it is substantially burdened, and would essentially remove the courts from the process entirely. And -- and I think one point to -- to remember is we are dealing with the interplay between two statutes, and as -- as the Court acknowledged in Epic Systems v. Lewis, ultimately, deciding how two statutes work together, where the boundaries are, is a question for courts.
That can't be left just to the agencies. And we submit the Women's Health Amendment impose a mandatory obligation.
It says, ""shall at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost-sharing requirements for."" And, nevertheless, what is clear from the -- the floor debate on that is that Congress envisioned that it would require coverage for preventive services, that family planning would be included. Now you also have extremely important interests in RFRA and in the nature of the religious objections that are being claimed. Ultimately, courts need to resolve these questions.
And the agencies have essentially taken these decisions out of the -- the realm of the judiciary and decided for themselves.
And that -- that simply isn't how RFRA works, and under Epic, it's not how these questions should be resolved. Thank you very much, Mr. Fischer. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. General Francisco, you have a minute for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Although RFRA both authorizes and requires these exemptions, at the very least, they're justified under Section 13(a)(4).
That, after all, was the very basis for the church exemption back in 2011.
It's also the basis for the effective exemption that applies to self-insured church plans, as illustrated with respect to the colloquy between my friend and Justice Sotomayor.
And if you accept Respondents' interpretation of the accommodation, it's also the basis for the accommodation itself. Under my friend's position, they seem to concede that all of these other provisions violate Section 13(a)(4).
After all, the church exemption is not limited to ministers, and the church exemption applies to churches that don't even object to contraception. But regardless of how you resolve the issue, the rules here bring a decade-long dispute to a durable end, and they should be upheld. Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1501, Liu versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Rapawy. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: SEC disgorgement orders compel a payment to the Treasury as a consequence for violation of a public law.
An order like that is a penalty, as this Court's unanimous decision in Kokesh makes clear. A penalty must be authorized by statute.
So must any action by an administrative agency.
There is no statutory authority for the SEC to seek disgorgement orders from a federal court and, therefore, it cannot. I have three main points to make this morning.
First, the text, structure, and context of the securities laws offer a straightforward route to reversal.
Congress has created for SEC court actions a tiered system of civil money penalties that does not include disgorgement. Congress has also given the SEC authority for an order requiring accounting and disgorgement, using those very words, in an -- in an administrative proceeding but no similar authority for court actions. And Congress has given other agencies clear textual authority for judicial disgorgement orders.
Using traditional tools of statutory construction, the result is clear: The SEC can seek the authorized penalties but no others. Second, the statute's allowance for equitable relief does not help the SEC because penalties are not equitable relief.
That has been the law for centuries. There is no principal distinction between the characteristics that make SEC disgorgement a penalty under Kokesh and those that make it a penalty under the old equity rule.
Its purpose is to punish disobedience of a public law.
Any return of money or property to those injured by the violation is discretionary at best and often never happens. Third, the phrase ""equitable relief,"" enacted as part of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, did not ratify circuit court cases that had approved SEC disgorgement.
Those cases, beginning with Texas Gulf Sulphur, did not look to statutory text.
They certainly did not settle the meaning of text that did not even exist yet. Instead, we have here only congressional silence, and silence does not give an agency any authority to act, much less the authority to punish. Mr. Rapawy, you started out by saying Kokesh labeled this a penalty and equity doesn't enforce penalties and that's it. But Kokesh was in a specific context. It said, for statute of limitations purposes, it is a penalty.
For a different purpose, it need not be characterized as -- as a penalty for determining whether the fraudster can retain the profits of the fraud.
That's something different. But the notion that because we categorize it in one context, disgorgement, as a penalty, does not necessarily carry over to another.
There was a great legal scholar who has been often quoted by this Court, Walter Wheeler Cook, who said the tendency to assume that a word appearing in two or more legal contexts and so in connection with more than one purpose -- one purpose is statute of limitations, another is depriving the fraudster of the profits of the fraud -- to assume that that characterization in one context carries over to another is a notion that has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against. So all Kokesh did was say, for statute of limitations purposes, this is a penalty.
It did not say -- in fact, it was specific in footnoting that it was not saying that in every context it is a penalty. Justice Ginsburg, I certainly agree that this Court reserved this question in Kokesh in Footnote 3.
And my argument is not that the holding of that case resolves this case but that the reasoning of that case can't effectively been -- be distinguished from this case. And my reasons for saying that, the issues to which this Court looked in Kokesh in determining whether SEC disgorgement is a penalty track the reason or the -- the justifications or the -- the cases in which equity said it would not enforce penalties. The -- the most important of those is Kokesh's second reason, which is the -- that -- it found that SEC disgorgement has primarily a punitive purpose, and that goes directly to the core of the equity distinction. Why is it -- is that so? Is it not an equitable principle that no one should be allowed to profit from his own wrong? That's not an equitable principle? That is certainly an equitable principle, Your Honor.
However, it is -- it is also an equitable principle that -- that a court of equity will not inflict a penalty; it will make the person no worse off than they were had they not committed the wrong. And SEC disgorgement is a penalty within the meaning of that rule because, as the Court stated in Kokesh, it does, in fact, it frequently does, did in this case, leave the wrongdoer worse off than if the wrong had never been committed. But is your argument that disgorgement is never possible or that disgorgement has been interpreted too broadly by the courts? Suppose it were limited to net profits and suppose every effort was made to return the money to the victims of the fraud.
Would that not fall within a traditional form of equitable relief? I think it still would not, Your Honor, and the reason is that the -- the traditional form of equitable relief to which the government has drawn an analogy is the accounting, and an accounting did have those characteristics that Your Honor has stated. But it also had the characteristic that it was typically available only in cases involving a breach of fiduciary duty.
Now there are instances in which it was applied outside breaches of fiduciary duty, but I believe that in those cases it would be properly characterized as part of the equity court's ancillary jurisdiction.
And a remedy that was only within the ancillary jurisdiction of a court of equity would not be a remedy that was typically available in equity, as this Court has interpreted that phrase. What -- what do you mean by ""ancillary""? Ancillary jurisdiction meaning that once a court had some other independent ground of equitable jurisdiction over the case -- and this is true of the old patent and copyright cases -- it might then to go on -- go on to award an accounting in order to afford complete relief. How about the fraud cases in which it was granted? So I believe that the fraud cases -- and we do address this in our -- in our reply, Your Honor -- I believe the fraud cases all -- that the professors -- I assume you're referring to the fraud cases cited in Professor Laycock's brief, and I think those all involve fiduciary relationships. But let me -- let me go back to that answer you gave.
There is a statute here that entitles the court to give equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors. I'm not sure why this doesn't provide ancillary jurisdiction in the manner that you've spoken about, assuming, as Justice Alito has just stated, that the accounting is only for net profits that are given to the actual people injured. We -- we have other -- I recognize the multitude of questions, joint and several liability, recovery for net profits of people, tippees and things like that.
Putting all of that aside, just a simple straightforward case of net profits from investors who are actually injured. So I have -- I have two answers to that, Justice Sotomayor, if I may. And one -- the first answer is that precisely because of the complexities that your question recognizes, the better course would be to say this remedy that the SEC has sought here, SEC disgorgement, which does not have a historical parallel, does not exist.
And if the S -- So why is it okay in the administrative process and in all the other laws where you say disgorgement is referenced? You're making an argument that there should never, ever be disgorgement -- Not at all, Your Honor. -- in any statute, because it's undefined in some way outside the common law? Not at all, Your Honor. I am saying that in those con -- when Congress says disgorgement, then it is the Court's task to figure out what does disgorgement mean. And perhaps in doing so, it would look at that history and say, well, it would -- you know, the money has to go back to the individuals and it can be no more than -- than the amount of the gains and so forth. But, in a case where Congress has not said disgorgement, and they did not say so here, I think the Court should hesitate to read it into a general provision for equitable relief. If we -- And my -- Keep going, sorry. And my second point in connection with that is that the reason not to read equitable relief to encompass ancillary jurisdiction is the same one this Court gave in Great-West.
And that is that if you -- because an equity court having jurisdiction of the case could award any kind of relief using its ancillary jurisdiction, including even compensatory or punitive damages, if you were to read the term that broadly, it would be no limitation at all. If we were not to agree with you on this last point, what do you then say to Justice Alito's two conditions, net profits, returned to victims? If you were not to agree with me on that point, then those are the -- the primary inconsistencies that we've identified, we've established with regard to historical remedy. I do think that the remedy that was applied here, that the SEC sought here, was -- was clearly a penalty and clearly inconsistent with Kokesh and that the -- there -- there is an important background principle that -- And that's because it was not limited to net profits and was not returned to the victims, at least not necessarily? Yes.
And I would also say because it -- it doesn't have the historical parallel because there was no fiduciary duty pleaded or proved, but -- Right.
That's the -- -- Your Honor has questioned that point. Yeah. And -- You may be right or wrong on that point.
I just wanted to isolate your answer just to be -- Okay.
So -- -- just to be clear. -- analytically, Your Honor, the point is -- the point is separate. I do think that there are substantive reasons for limiting the remedy to the fiduciary duty as well, and that goes -- and this is discussed in the amicus brief by Professors Bray and Smith that talk about the origins of the fiduciary or, rather, the accounting remedy, and -- and explain that it is -- it is in some respect equity forcing the fiduciary to do what the fiduciary should have been doing in the first place, which is to keep -- keep track of the property that person is holding for someone else, to make no profits on it, and to remit to that person any -- any profits they had gained. Those are substantive duties that do not apply to everyone who is subject to the securities laws. But how -- how realistic do you think it is to assume that when Congress used this term ""equitable relief,"" Congress meant to incorporate every curlicue of old equity jurisprudence? My best answer to that, Your Honor, is that this Court had given the phrase ""equitable relief"" in ERISA that meaning six months before Congress passed this statute. So, if Congress had wanted to know exactly what ""equitable relief"" meant in the most recent precedent of this Court, in a statute that I think has some similar structure -- structural issues to this one, and I'd like to get to those, they would have gone to Great-West and they would have said, huh, okay, this -- they will look to history if we use these words. If we don't want them to look to history, we should use other words.
We should use words, for example, such as they later used for the -- for the C -- CFTC where they said equitable remedies and disgorgement and restitution count as equitable remedies.
They would have enlarged it if they wanted to go beyond historical remedies, given the -- the interpretation that this Court had -- has -- had given those words so recently. But, Mr. Rapawy, Congress acted against a backdrop in which the SEC was routinely seeking disgorgement, didn't it? It did, Your Honor. However, I do not think that that supports the government's position here for two reasons. The first is that those cases, the cases that form that backdrop were not interpreting the text, not interpreting the words, and so the prior construction canon by its terms does not apply. The second and perhaps more substantive reason is that the decisions in the court -- in the circuit courts were not, although there was -- there was a consensus that the SEC could get something accounted as disgorgement, there was not a consensus as to what the -- what that disgorgement was.
And I would point to two specific examples. One is the Lipson case, which the government cites in its brief as one of its consensus cases.
That's a Seventh Circuit decision by Judge Posner.
It's earlier the same year that Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted.
And that decision says that the relief in that case, the disgorgement in that case, counted as equitable relief under Section 21(d) only because it was relief against a fiduciary. So, if you think that Congress meant to adopt the circuits, you would then have to decide did it mean to adopt Judge Posner's view, in which case we would be correct that only fiduciaries are covered. The second example that I would give you is the Fifth Circuit's decision in SEC versus Blatt, and that was a decision in which it explicitly stated the money was going back to the investors. And so, to the extent that what the government has sought to assert here is the authority to send the money to the Treasury, well, would Congress have looked to the decision in Blatt and said: Well, no, actually, the money, it looks like it would go back to the investors and not to the Treasury. Well, that may raise the qualifications that Justice Alito was talking about on what the disgorgement remedy would entail.
But the basic understanding that there was something that counted as -- as -- as that, that was in line with equitable powers, isn't that a reasonable way to read the statute? I don't think it is, Your Honor, because I think it would leave too many -- it would essentially leave this Court in the position of deciding how the traditional remedy, which would not by its terms apply here, the government agrees in its brief that SEC disgorgement is a substantial departure from historical norms. How do you craft that historical remedy in light of all the policies under the securities acts to -- to make sense here and apply here? And I think that should be done by the legislature in the first instance. I'm sorry, but they don't do it when they gave the SEC administrative authority for disgorgement.
And if we have an administrative order by the SEC, we have to do exactly what you're telling us not to do.
We would have to define what they meant by that. And -- and so what's the difference between doing it in that context, where Congress has used the word disgorgement, and this context, where we can presume or would presume that there was something called disgorgement that could have been restitution on -- or unjust enrichment or something else of that ilk? Well, Your Honor, with respect, I think in -- in the -- in the administrative context, they did.
They gave the SEC regulatory -- rule-making authority concerning its disgorgement proceedings. So that question is not going to go to the courts in the first instance.
It's going to go to the agency in the first instance, and then the agency will balance all the policy considerations that I'm talking about. But at least Congress has clearly said you, agency, may do this, and you, agency, may do this even if it's a punishment, I would -- I would submit.
And there are important background principles that this Court should not and -- and the courts in general should not say an agency may do this where Congress has not said so.
And equally to the court -- the -- the -- that the court should not say this person may be punished where Congress has not said so. And I would refer back in that context to this Court's decision in Wallace versus Cutten, one of the early administrative law decisions, the Court's opinion through Justice Brandeis, where the -- the agency in that case had the authority to bar people from trading in grain futures.
But the language of the statute permitted them to do it only for -- in cases of ongoing violations.
And they wanted to do it in cases of past violations, effectively to serve as a punishment for those past violations. And the Court said we will not -- Justice Brandeis for the Court said: We will not enlarge the statute.
We will not put something in that Congress has -- has not put there to make punishable what the stat -- what -- what -- by the terms of the statute -- I'm not quoting exactly now but paraphrasing -- what by the terms of the statute was only to be prevented. And I think that that is a principle that ought to, you know, have some weight here as the Court considers what to do.
This authority is being used by the agency to punish, that their justification for it is punitive. The Court's decision in Kokesh said that it is punitive. But I believe you agreed with me that it's an equitable principle, that no one should profit from his or her own wrong.
And I already suggested to you that it can be punishment in one context and it can be an equitable remedy in another context. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but I would say that in -- I would refer back to this Court's decision in Livingston, which talked specifically about what counts as punishment in terms of the equitable rule. And in that case, it's -- it's one of the older patent cases, the special master had imposed a remedy, a -- that -- that effectively was what we probably would call a damages remedy now.
He allowed the -- the -- the patent owner to recover from the infringer not what the infringer actually did gain but what the infringer might have gained.
And he said the measure is going to be -- because this person is a trespasser and a wrongdoer, the -- the measure of recovery is going to be what the -- the patent owner lost, not what the infringer gained. And this Court said no, that is a penalty that goes beyond the practices of equity.
We are aware of no rule that converts a court of equity into an institute for the punishment of simple torts. And I think with all -- with the greatest respect, when you take the principle that no one can punish by their own -- no one can benefit from their own wrong, excuse me, and you decouple that from the historical context and the historical remedies in which those rules would apply, and you turn it into something, as was done here, where it exceeds what the district court found to be the gross pecuniary gain and where it requires a payment to the Treasury, it has gone beyond the realm of -- of what equity would have recognized. Would it be -- I thought there were efforts to get the money to the investors.
It doesn't require the money to be paid into the Treasury.
If the SEC can locate the investors and get the money back to them, the SEC says that's what it would do. They -- they do that in some cases, Your Honor.
They do not do it in all cases.
It is difficult from the public materials to determine how often they do it and how much money they do give back to investors. Well, suppose we were to reject your broad argument and focus the question on -- on this issue and also on the net profits issue. What constraints do you think the SEC is under? I'm sorry, Your Honor. Constraints? On the -- on the question of giving money back to the investors, I think Justice Ginsburg raised the issue about maybe you can't find them, they're not identifiable, there are too many of them. How -- what -- what do you think that if -- if we -- if we said, you know, it's an equitable principle that the money should go back to the investors if possible, what does that mean exactly that the SEC has to do? I would say that if you were to take that position and disagree with my primary argument, it would -- then the -- the rule should be, if you're giving the money back to the investors, then you can take it and not otherwise, because if you're not giving it back to the investors, then it's just a punishment. So not otherwise, even if like you -- you've tried to find the investors and you can't? Well, I mean, I don't know that there's any way in which the Court could workably police how hard they're trying, Your Honor.
And their -- Well, you know, make -- make good-faith efforts; make, you know, diligent efforts.
What -- whatever words you want to use. I -- I mean, Your Honor could certainly write that a decision -- in a decision.
I don't think it would be sufficient guidance or sufficient compulsion to the agency to ensure that this was used for compensatory purposes and not for punitory -- Counsel -- How -- -- why -- why -- oh, I'm sorry, Chief. Excuse me. How hard is that? Presumably, the investors would want money, and I -- I suppose these things could be done, you know, secretly or -- but, if -- if the SEC is engaged in a proceeding like this with respect to investments, I would assume that investors should be pretty easy to find if there's money available. I -- I guess what I would say, Your Honor, is that the -- the -- in many cases that they currently use the power, they don't even believe that it's appropriate to return the money to investors.
And I would point to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases as the biggest example of that. In theory, you know, could they find them? They apparently do find it difficult in many cases because, in many cases, the money goes to the Treasury, but there are many cases in which it is currently applied under which none of this rationale would -- would apply at all, including nine- and ten-figure recoveries against private companies that are basically just money taken from the investors and put to the Treasury because they -- because that's how they -- because they -- they want to use it as a deterrent.
They want to use it as a deterrent and a punishment and to make an example out of the violators of the securities laws. Counsel, in -- in -- in equity and kind of paralleled in our class action practice today, we do police the efforts of the defendant to find and return money to the investors that he or she's defrauded.
Sometimes there's some left over and -- and -- because people can't be found and we've had cases about what to do with that money as well. But why doesn't that supply at least a ready guide and maybe make it impermissible for the government to not make any effort at all or -- but why can't we police it, assuming we reject your primary argument? I guess that would go -- I would -- I'm not saying you couldn't draw an analogy to the class action cases, Justice Gorsuch.
Clearly you could.
I think at that point -- And they come from equity and traditional principles of equity, right? I mean, they're drawn from that? Under traditional principles of equity, they couldn't recover because there's no fiduciary here, Your Honor, but -- I understand your argument. But -- but in the class action context as a workable matter, you could, but I really think that is getting to the point where the Court is creating a new regulatory scheme where one doesn't currently exist to save a remedy that was originally created on the basis of circuit court decisions that the government doesn't really defend anymore and that the best course would be to say: This remedy that the agency sought here does not exist, and if -- if they think that they need this remedy, they should go to Congress for it. And may I ask you about your net profits rule, a similar kind of question? I mean, what does the SEC, in your view, have to deduct? So, at a minimum, they have to start from the right place, which is they have to start from the gains to the individual defendant rather than what they did in this case, which is starting from the losses to investors. And then I believe the standard that this Court -- if you're -- if you're going to go by the accounting standard that's applied in -- in the old patent cases, you would say it's you calculate the profits as a manufacturer calculates the profits of his -- of their own business. So it would be certainly legitimate expenses.
Here, we had lease payments that weren't disputed that were actual lease payments and equipment payments that it wasn't disputed it was actual equipment payment.
And the district court said: I'm not going to count any of that essentially for punitive reasons.
I think you're bad guys.
You had fraudulent intent from the start and so none of it counts. If the leases in the machinery was just a printout, only used for more fraudulent stuff, would you deduct it then? I mean, what they did is they had fliers going around saying invest in my fraudulent gold company, the equivalent thereof. Well, I suppose that -- Then you'd deduct it? I'm sorry. Is that legitimate? I think there may be a certain point at which you could say -- I mean, there's -- you could imagine a Ponzi scheme, Your Honor, and in the case of the Ponzi scheme, okay, it's all tainted. But I think that the decision below did not give the kind of consideration you would need to give before reaching that kind of conclusion about these defendants, where -- You -- finish that sentence. I'll wrap it up there, Your Honor. You may not want to -- okay.
Thank -- thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by discussing the significance of Kokesh, and, as some of the questions have illuminated, the Court in Kokesh said that SE -- disgorgement in SEC cases was a penalty for purposes of a statute of limitations provision.
There's no reason to read the decision more broadly. And, in particular, the three reasons that the Court gave for concluding that it was a penalty for these purposes don't -- they can't map onto the criteria for determining whether something is equitable relief.
The three characteristics that the Court identified were it's imposed as a consequence of violating a public law, it serves a deterrent purpose, and it's not compensatory. And I'd say first that all three of those characteristics were present in Kansas versus Nebraska, in which this Court, sitting as a court of original jurisdiction, ordered disgorgement in an interstate compact case.
And in that case, the Court emphasized that when the interstate compact was ratified by Congress, it took on the character of a public law.
And the Court said the equitable power of a court of equity is all the greater when the public interest is concerned. Second, the disgorgement remedy in that case was intended only to serve deterrent purposes.
That was the whole justification for the remedy, because, due to the fairly idiosyncratic economic circumstances of the parties, the special master concluded and the Court agreed that a compensatory damages remedy would not be sufficient to deter future violations.
And so compensatory damages were awarded, but the Court ordered disgorge -- partial disgorgement on top of that in order to ensure that there would be an adequate deterrent. And for the same reason, the third characteristic that the Court identified in Kokesh, namely, that disgorgement in SEC cases is not compensatory, was true in Kansas versus Nebraska as well.
The disgorgement remedy was ordered on top of the compensatory damages award.
That was deemed adequate to compensate Kansas for its losses. I'd like to turn next to the issue that was taking up the discussion towards the end of Mr. Rapawy's argument, which is the formula by which the SEC urges that disgorgement be calculated and courts ordinarily calculate disgorgement in -- in fraud cases. The Court in Kokesh cited the third restatement of restitution and unjust enrichment for the general rule that net profits are the measure of disgorgement and that the defendant is entitled to deduct its marginal costs. Now the term ""general rule"" implies that there will be exceptions.
And if you look at literally the next page of the restatement from the one that the Court cited, the restatement says the defendant will not be allowed a deduction for the direct expenses of an attempt to defraud the claimant. And so, for example, if part of your expenditures are, as Justice Breyer were -- was hypothesizing, if part of your expenditures are sending out fraudulent communications, false sales pitches that are intended to deceive consumers in to -- to buying securities, that would be the kind of expense that under traditional equitable expenses -- under traditional equitable principles would not be allowed. A second example.
In Foreign Corrupt Practices cases -- Act cases, the wrong is that the defendant company has obtained a contract by paying a bribe to the public official, and the SEC would say, in those cases, the proper measure of disgorgement is net profits earned on the contract. And so the defendant wouldn't be charged gross receipts.
The defendant would be allowed to deduct its operating expenses, but we wouldn't allow the defendant to count the bribe itself as a cost of doing business, as a deductible expense.
That, in our view, wouldn't be allowed in computing the amount of disgorgement that would be ordered. So the one thing that I would emphasize most strongly is we are not -- as to measure of disgorgement, we are not asking for an SEC-specific rule.
We believe that the arguments we've made in prior cases have been consistent with traditional equitable principles because, even though the general rule is that you use net profits as the measure, that is subject to exceptions.
And we rely on the exceptions in a variety of circumstances. The second point I would make is, if we're wrong, if in some instance or instances or in some category of cases courts have been awarding disgorgement in an amount that exceeds what traditional equitable principles would produce, then the correct answer is not to give us everything and it's not to give us nothing. It's that courts should continue to order disgorgement but compute it in accordance with traditional general equitable rules, not in accordance with any SEC-specific formula. But your -- your position is, if I understand it correctly, follow whatever the common law rule was with respect to calculating net profits, return it to investors, but that you're also a victim and so that you -- you could take the money ahead of investors, that you can keep the leftover amounts? What -- what is your position with respect to that broader question of who gets the money? Why is it the Treasury? It's not the SEC getting the money. And one could see if -- potentially an argument that if the SEC got the money, it could then spend it on protecting investors, but if the Treasury's getting it -- and I know you're going to say money is fungible -- but, if the Treasury is getting it, we don't really know if it's being used to help investors. Let me say three or four things in -- in response to that.
The first is that, as an empirical matter, the SEC tries to return the money to investors when it can, and we're largely successful in doing that. Now there is a category of cases like the FCPA cases, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases, where sometimes we do get big judgments.
They're not returned to investors because there really is no obvious universe of individual victims from an FCPA violation -- an FCPA violation.
But, in cases where individual victims can be located and the money can be distributed, it's our general practice to do so. The second thing is that -- Before you -- before you leave that, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I -- I thought last time around in Kokesh that the representation from the government was different on that score and that sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. I mean, sometimes it is done and sometimes it is not done.
Sometimes the reason that it is not done is, as I was saying with respect to the FCPA, there just is no obvious universe of investors. Sometimes it's not done because it's a fraud that involves bilking a very large number of investors out of a very small amount of money each, and it's deemed infeasible to go to the expense of locating the individuals given the small amount that each would receive. Is it sometimes not done just because it's not done? I -- I can't rule out that possibility.
I will say that this is at the discretion of the court.
Now the statute doesn't require that it be forwarded to investors in any particular category of cases, but this is at the court's discretion. Would the government have any difficulty with a rule that the money should be returned to investors where feasible? I would say if -- if that is couched as a general equitable principle; that is, the court is sitting as a court of equity, there would be nothing wrong with a district judge in an individual case saying unless you can persuade me that it is infeasible to return this money to investors, I am going to order that that be done.
I don't think that's typical practice, but -- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt from Justice Sotomayor's question.
I apologize. No.
And -- and so, yes, there -- there is nothing in the statute that precludes -- in individual cases where it seems to be feasible, there's nothing that would preclude the district court from insisting on that. Now, as we pointed out in the brief, the Dodd-Frank Act does have these -- I'm sorry, the Dodd-Frank Act has these provisions that identify permissible uses of money that is disgorged in a judicial or administrative action but is not ultimately forwarded to investors. It can be used, for instance, to pay whistleblowers. And so the statute specifically contemplates the possibility that disgorged funds sometimes will not be distributed for what -- whatever reason.
And it would really undermine the statutory scheme to say that distribution to investors is in all circumstances a prerequisite to disgorgement. Why? If -- if -- if the statute says that equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors, do we have to say here and should we say or not say here that that means if it's not feasible to return it to investors, that it's for the benefit of investors to give it to the SEC? I -- that statutory language, we think, and I want to explain why, refers to measures that will benefit the investor community generally, not necessarily the particular individual victims. And I'd give the following reasons. The first is that language applies to equitable relief generally under Section 21(d)(5).
And so, if you imagine a court contemplating an injunction, it would obviously be a very constrained view of the court's injunctive authority in an SEC enforcement action to say that the court can only issue an injunction that will benefit the particular individuals who have been victimized. But if we can get back to the money, which is where we're at, not injunctive relief.
I -- I -- I just want to -- I would like an answer to Justice Sotomayor's question, which is, if -- if it's feasible, on what account should the government not be in the business of returning the money, given -- given the statement in the statute that we're supposed to be following equitable principles here? I -- I -- I -- I take that to be her point or her question to you, and -- and I would appreciate an answer to that. I -- I -- I don't -- I don't see a problem with saying it is appropriate or necessary only if it is forwarded to investors if it is feasible to do that.
The point I was making about the -- the whistleblowers and such was Congress clearly didn't think that a disgorgement award could be appropriate or necessary only if it was forwarded to investors, because it made specific provision for the circumstance in which disgorged funds were left over. The -- the other point I'd like to address, and Mr. -- Can I make sure I'm clear on your answer to Justice Gorsuch and Justice Sotomayor? Because the first time you answered it, you said it would be appropriate for a district court to say that. And I think Justice Gorsuch then followed up and Justice Sotomayor.
Would it be appropriate for this Court to say that's the rule; namely, that it has to be returned to investors where feasible? I -- I -- I wouldn't have a problem with that.
I mean, I don't know that it is kind of in accordance with usual principles for the Court to announce that sort of instruction, but it would be consistent with the SEC's practice.
It would certainly be directing the district courts to do something that they could do already as an exercise of their equitable discretion. The only other thing I would say is it's common ground that the SEC is authorized to impose disgorgement administratively, and its decisions are reviewable, but they're reviewed under a more deferential standard. And so the Court reviewing an SEC disgorgement order is not going to be asking was this a correct exercise of equitable discretion, just was it within the range of reasonableness. The -- The other thing I wanted to say that I -- I think is -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. Well, you -- you were talking about the administrative authority to order disgorgement, but you said that an admin -- an ALJ can't do what a court could do, as it did in this case, order an asset freeze. But couldn't you take the administrative decision and ask a court to enforce that decision by freezing assets? I mean, we sometime -- we sometimes do, after issuing an administrative order, go to a court for enforcement if the defendant is not obeying, and I think one of the reasons that the SEC sometimes elects to proceed in court originally is if we have doubts about the defendant's compliance and we think we're going to be in court anyway, then we might want to save a step and go there first. I guess part of our response to the arguments about could we do this administratively are to the effect that it wouldn't be entirely unworkable.
It would be better than no alternative at all, but there's no reason for the Court to set up an incentive that creates an artificial -- a system that creates an artificial incentive for us to proceed in that way, since the defendant will receive additional proceed -- protections if the case is in court. The -- the other thing I would say that I -- I think is at least in part respective -- responsive to Justice Sotomayor's question and -- and also responds to something that Mr. Rapawy said, he -- he characterized the government as having conceded that our disgorgement is a substantial departure from historical norms.
And that -- that's not really what we said. In the last paragraph of our brief, the point we were trying to make was that you look back at the 19th century cases in which disgorgement was ordered, and they all involved awards to individual victims.
That wasn't because there was a large body of law saying you couldn't award disgorgement to the government. It was simply because, until the middle part of the 20th century, civil enforcement actions filed by federal regulatory agencies were not a thing, and so the question didn't come up one way or the other. And when those types of actions started to become prevalent, courts had to -- to grapple with questions about how do legal principles that were developed in the context of private suits map onto government enforcement actions? And in 1950, somebody could have argued very plausibly that it just doesn't make sense to order disgorgement to the government because the essence of disgorgement has always been payment to the wronged entity.
You could also have made a strong argument on the other side that the core purposes of disgorgement are to prevent the wrongdoer from profiting from its own wrong and thereby to deter future violations, and disgorgement can serve those traditional purposes, regardless of where the money ends up. And as of 1850, that was an open question.
By the time that Congress enacted Section 21(d)(5) in 2002, that question had really been resolved, because this Court in Porter and Mitchell had said the federal courts' equitable powers are at their height when the public interest is involved.
For 30 years, courts in SEC enforcement actions had been awarding disgorgement.
Congress had passed statutory provisions that pre- -- both presuppose the availability of disgorgement in SEC judicial proceedings and that authorized the SEC to impose disgorgement administratively. And so whatever else you -- whatever other lessons you might derive from the decision to authorize this to be done at administrative proceedings, clearly, Congress didn't think that there was anything incongruous about the idea of disgorgement going to the government, disgorgement going in an SE -- in a government enforcement action. And so, when Congress passed Section 21(d)(5) in 2002, if you were asking kind of a conscientious well-informed member of Congress what do you think you are authorizing when you authorize district courts to issue appropriate -- equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary, the first thing they would ask is, what kind of equitable relief have courts been awarding up to this point? For -- for instance, when you get statutes where -- that authorize a court to issue an injunction in accordance with the principles of equity, how do you decide whether a particular injunction is in accordance with the principles of equity? You look at the way that equity courts have been doing it in the past. And the lesson the Court has drawn is you look to factors like adequacy of the remedy at law, irreparable injury, a grant of authority to proceed in accordance with the principles of equity, is basically an admonition, keep doing it the way that courts of equity have been doing it. And, similarly, in 2002, a conscientious member of Congress would have thought, at the very least, I'm authorizing courts to continue to enter the equitable remedies that they have entered up to that point.
And that was buttressed by the other provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in -- in 2002 that we've emphasized in our brief, which was the fair funds provision that establishes a mechanism to facilitate the distribution to investors of funds that are disgorged in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
And it also authorizes civil penalties to be added to those funds. What is your answer -- what is your response to the argument, if I have it right, that in equity, the closest thing is restitution, and in Great-West, the majority said: Well, restitution was an equitable remedy when it was a case in equity, but it was a legal remedy when it was a case in law? Well, I think what Great-West was dealing with specifically was -- A different thing.
I agree with that, but there's this statement there that restitution -- just what I said. Let me say two things in response to that.
The -- the first, Great-West was dealing with a breach of contract action, and so the Court in Great-West said that, in breach -- in breach-of-contract suits, if the contract calls for party A to pay money to party B, a suit seeking to compel A to pay the money to B had historically been regarded as seeking legal relief, not equitable relief. And then, as Mr. Rapawy was saying, the Court in Great-West emphasized that, yes, there are some sorts of legal remedies.
They're not considered inherently equitable, but courts of equity could sometimes award them as a matter ancillary to their equitable jurisdiction.
And the Court said, at least under ERISA, that's not what equitable relief meant. I -- I don't think disgorgement can really be portrayed in that way.
I mean, obviously, in Kansas versus Nebraska, the Court ordered disgorgement as -- treated disgorgement as inherently equitable relief.
And one sign that it regarded disgorgement as equitable rather than legal was it said it is an appropriate exercise of authority to enter partial disgorgement.
Yes, we would have authority to issue -- require the defendant to hand over the full amount of its profits, but, under the circumstances of the case, we think an adequate deterrent purpose would be served by requiring Nebraska to hand over a fraction of its profits but far from the whole. That -- that's the kind of equitable discretion that the -- that's the kind of discretionary judgment that is inherent in equity. The other thing I would say about Mr. Rapawy's argument with respect to Livingston and the patent cases, I mean, before the Court had specific statutory authority to do so, in cases like Livingston, the Court held that a defendant's profits were the -- were an appropriate element of relief in a patent infringement suit.
And the defendant was not acting as a fiduciary or trustee; the defendant was simply committing a wrong using an invention in which the plaintiff had a property right, and that was found to be an appropriate element of relief.
And the Court in Livingston said it is not permissible for a court of equity to also award interest because that would be a penalty. Now I think our legal system regards interest differently than it did back in the day, but I think the general principle from Livingston remains sound.
That is, if a court were to compute disgorgement in accordance with traditional equitable principles, both the general rule that net profits are the measure and any established equitable exceptions to that rule, if the court computed its -- a disgorgement award in that manner and then said I'm tacking on another 50 percent because your behavior was so egregious, we would agree that that would be a penalty.
That would be something that would not be an appropriate exercise of equitable authority under Section 21(d)(5). It -- it could still be done in the SEC cases, because the Congress has authorized civil penalties in addition to equitable relief, but it could not be justified as an exercise of equitable authority.
But that's not what -- what's being done in this case. What do you do with the Ninth Circuit saying there were no legitimate expenses to -- to deduct, to arrive at net profit? I -- they -- they allowed us a very small deduction for the amount that remained in the corporate account and could be distributed to investors, and, certainly, that would always be an appropriate deduction, any -- any benefit that the investors received at the end of the day. But there were basically two categories of expenses that the Ninth Circuit and the district court didn't allow.
One was for the overseas marketing attempts.
And I think that was simply the -- the type of expense that Justice Breyer was talking about.
This was money spent to perpetrate the fraud, money spent to try to induce other investors to pay their money into what was an -- essentially a fraud -- pervasively a fraudulent scheme. The other was Mr. Rapawy is correct that some of the money was spent on things like equipment, facilities, things that in another context might have qualified as legitimate business expenses had there been a true intent to construct a cancer treatment facility and do what the marketer said they were going to do. What the district court said -- and I believe this is on page 18a of the Petition Appendix -- it characterized those expenses as a half-hearted attempt to convey the illusion of progress. And so the court's analysis on that point was not extensive, but -- but we take the point to have been these were not legitimate business expenses because they didn't represent a true good-faith effort to construct the relevant facility.
They simply represented an effort to fool investors into thinking that things were going along as planned. And those -- those findings were certainly subject to being reviewed on appeal. We would agree that, had the investors had it in their minds to construct the facility and it just didn't pan out at the end of the day, those would have been the sorts of things that could have been used as deductions. But given the conclusion of the lower courts that this was a pervasively fraudulent scheme in which essentially all of the expenses were made to perpetrate the fraud, then we think it's in accordance with traditional equitable principles to allow no deductions. But, again, the point we had stressed most strongly is we think that Congress has authorized courts to award disgorgement as computed under traditional rules of equity. If in a particular case or even if in some larger category of cases the Court believes that exorbitant disgorgement has been awarded, then the proper response is be more careful about -- to tell lower courts be more careful about the computation. It -- it couldn't under any circumstances be a justification for holding that Congress has not authorized disgorgement at all. If there -- there are no further questions, we would urge the Court to affirm. Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Rapawy. Thank you, Your Honor.
I will be brief. On the question of Kansas versus Nebraska, I believe that the Court was explicitly in that case exercising its authority in the singular sphere of interstate relations to craft a new remedy.
It was not applying traditional equitable principles. There was a dispute between the majority and the dissent about whether it was appropriate to adopt Section 39 of the third restatement, but, either way, that was a case of the Court making a new remedy that did not previously historically exist. And that would not be appropriate to do here, where you are interpreting a statute in which Congress has already set forth a detailed remedial scheme. On the question of the calculation of the individuals -- of the amounts of disgorgement, there are explicit findings in this record as to the gross pecuniary gain to each individual.
It's 6.7 for Mr. Liu and it is 1.5 million for -- for Ms. Wang. And if you are applying the traditional historical approach, you would start at the gain to each defendant -- to each defendant.
You wouldn't start at the total losses to investors and take deductions from there.
And I think that goes to show how far the -- the -- both -- both what happened in this individual case and also how far the analysis that's going on here is from the historical approach. I think the scope of disgorgement has grown over time in part because it is not grounded in statutory text, and that counsel's for returning it to Congress rather than crafting a new remedy and -- and -- by -- as a sort of adapting equitable principles. I think its practical function has been to compel payments to the Treasury.
There is no historical precedent for that.
I would cite to the Court's Gabelli case, in which the Court found that there was no precedent for applying the equitable doctrine of the discovery rule to -- to cases by the government. So, too, here, there's no precedent for using an accounting to compel funds be paid to the Treasury. Finally -- What -- what about the statutes that assume the availability of disgorgement? Those statutes would have no work to do if -- if the Court can order disgorgement absent express statutory authority? We tried to show in our opening brief, Your Honor, that -- that most of those statutes do have some work to do.
There are one or two that don't. Even in those cases, I would say that those statutes at most reflect a presupposition or awareness by Congress that courts were doing this, not an authorization, and authorization is what's needed to authorize -- to inflict a penalty. Finally, if the Court does conclude that some remedy may survive -- may survive in some case, I would urge it, nevertheless, to reverse and not to remand in this case. These individuals have already been ordered to pay their entire gross pecuniary gains, and anything above and beyond that would go beyond the equitable principle that no individual should be -- should be permitted to profit from his or her own wrong. And with that, Your Honors, I would respectfully request the Court reverse. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-8369, Lomax versus Ortiz-Marquez. Mr. Burgess. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are not strikes under Section 1915(g) for three reasons. First, the statute uses a familiar legal phrase with a well-established meaning in the context relevant here.
When courts review judicial orders to determine their impact on a future action, evaluating preclusion, for example, they conclusively presume that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" means dismissed with prejudice. In 1915(g), Congress used the same phrase in the same basic context.
There's every reason to think Congress expected courts to apply the phrase's settled meaning rather than to convert ordinary without-prejudice dismissals into sanctions that restrict future suits. Second, the structure of the PLRA further supports that interpretation.
Read together, the three dismissal categories identified in 1915(g) target actions that are facially meritless or otherwise abusive. Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are different.
They may be based on purely procedural defects, such as the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and it would be odd to impose a strike for such suits since Congress excluded from 1915(g)'s reach other categories of dismissals that don't implicate the merits or otherwise suggest abuse, such as dismissals based on sovereign immunity. Third and related, the other side's interpretation upsets the PLRA's balance by punishing prisoners for dismissals that, by definition, say nothing about the ultimate merits of their action.
This interpretation frustrates the Act's objective to filter out bad claims while still allowing for consideration of the good, since it restricts a prisoner's ability to bring a potentially legitimate claim even after the prisoner has cured a procedural defect. I'd like to start with the text of the statute.
The -- the other side's lead argument is that the term ""dismiss"" is sufficiently capacious to encompass both dismissals with prejudice or dismissals without prejudice as a -- as a dictionary matter.
And we don't disagree with that proposition, but we don't think that argument takes adequate account of the full statutory phrase at issue here and the context in which it is being used. You -- you are assuming that the preclusion question and the IFP status go hand in hand, but it could well be that a dismissal without prejudice will not have preclusive effect, but, at the same time, it could mean that you have to pay the filing fee. You -- you seem to be assuming that these two go hand in hand, but that's not necessarily so. I think it's true that they are analytically separable.
You could imagine having a consequence in the latter circumstance even if there wouldn't be a preclusion consequence, but the point of our argument is that in the particular context where it is be -- this phrase is being used in 1915(g), where you're looking to the consequence a dismissal has on the ability to bring a future action, that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" has an established meaning and courts would understand Congress to have meant to -- to signal that the dismissal would be with prejudice, that that is all that's being covered. And we think, if you look to the structure of the statute, that further supports that interpretation.
As I said at the opening, these dismissals that are being targeted -- and the other side appears to agree in its briefing -- are actions that are on their face meritless or otherwise abusive. When you're dealing with a dismissal without prejudice for failure to state a claim, it does not fit into that box because it can be for things that are purely procedural defects that suggest nothing about the merits of the action. And it's conspicuous that Congress excluded other types of dismissals from 1915(g) that share that feature.
I mentioned sovereign immunity.
The other side argues that, you know, well, even an action that is dismissed without prejudice could be considered meritless in a relevant sense because it is consuming the court's resources and not getting relief.
But it's clear that that's not what Congress had in mind because, if so, there's no explanation for why it excluded things like dismissals based on sovereign immunity per 1915(g) -- Mister -- Mr. Burgess, could you go back to your basic argument from the language? And you're, of course, right that there is a default rule that is used when somebody just says dismissal for a 12(b)(6) motion.
We assume that that's with prejudice as a kind of default rule. But why should we think that Congress, in enacting this language, incorporated that default rule, which is used for a different purpose, or -- or at least relied on its use? I mean, this is a different context.
Why would Congress have incorporated the default rule into its legislative provision? It -- it is a different context, but we think it's an analogous context in that in both 1915(g) and in the preclusion context, you're looking to determine what the effect of a prior dismissal is on a future action. And we think the implication of the other side's approach makes it a very unusual type of without-prejudice dismissal.
To an ordinary litigant, certainly to a pro se prisoner who is confronted with a dismissal that says this is without prejudice, the ordinary understanding would be that that is not going to limit your ability to bring a future action. Nonetheless, on the other side's interpretation of 1915(g), it has exactly that consequence because it is imposing a strike that might be a restriction on the ability to bring a future suit.
So we -- Does 19 -- But I suggest that that's not necessarily so.
It can -- you can be -- as far as the preclusion is concerned, without prejudice, no preclusion.
But we're not talking about preclusion.
We're talking about a strike that means you have to pay the filing fee. That's right.
I -- I think, for practical purposes, whether an indigent prisoner is going to have to pay the filing fee ends up overlapping very closely with whether that prisoner is going to be able to bring an action. And that's not just conjecture. Congress recognized that in 1915(b), which -- one of the things that the PLRA did was it required prisoners to pay -- even when they qualify to proceed IFP, to pay under installments.
But Congress made clear that under that provision, the inability should -- to pay should never be a bar to suit. So there's certainly a recognition that whether someone can proceed IFP is often going to be the ball game for whether they can bring a future suit. I understand your -- your point that there's a different level of blameworthiness, if you would, between frivolous, malicious, and failure to state a claim. On the other hand, 1915 was designed to ease the burden and expense on -- on courts. You -- you have, I think, the -- the marshal doing the service, the time of the court looking at the -- the claim before it can decide that it ought to dismiss.
And all that is attendant on the failure to state a claim, even without prejudice, as well as on the others. And the fact is, if you fail to state a claim, you fail to state a claim.
You say, well, maybe there's a procedural bar only and you can repeat.
But you have filed a complaint that's not meritorious in the claim.
The case is not meritorious even if the underlying claim may be if you properly plead. So since the -- the -- one of the driving factors was to ease the -- the burden both in volume and in -- in court time, why shouldn't we at least consider that rather than entirely the blameworthiness of the -- of the filers? I -- I do think it's a relevant consideration, but I think it supports our view of the statute.
The other side's argument as to why it's not such a harsh consequence to have a dismissal that's based on procedural grounds without prejudice or dismissals for insufficient pleading, for example, is there -- there could be repeated opportunities to amend and that that is how the system takes account of it. We think it's equally consistent and perhaps more preferable under the statute for courts to have the option to say: Look, this doesn't -- as pleaded, this does not state a claim.
Rather than continuing to congest the court's dockets, I'm going to dismiss this action but make it without prejudice.
And to the extent the without-prejudice dismissal is going to have a consequence -- Well, my point is the clogging of the dockets, the expense, that that has already occurred before the court can say, I'm going to dismiss this, this action. So, to that extent, the -- the impact on the system is the same for the other grounds for -- for denial. I -- I think that's right.
Of course, that's also true if an action is dismissed based on sovereign immunity.
It's having the same effect, yet it's clear that that is not something that counts as a strike under the statute.
So it doesn't seem as though Congress had in mind just something that is filed that needs to be dismissed is going to result in that consequence. Also -- district courts also have a great deal of power to determine whether something is going to have that consequence and result in a strike.
Of course, they will have the option in the vast majority of cases, if they think there's -- that there really is no opportunity to amend and succeed, then the dismissal should be with prejudice and there would be a strike under -- under either view. In the category of cases such as actions dismissed based on a Heck bar, where, just analytically, it is the kind of thing that is dismissed without prejudice, our rule perfectly allows for a district court to, nonetheless, have a strike in that instance if it -- if the Court determines that the assertion of the claim, despite Heck, is frivolous. Mr. Burgess, turning to that question, sort of two analytically tied questions.
To call this as a Heck bar comparable to immunity is one thing, because there you might have an argument that not counting as a strike a lack of jurisdiction, failure to exhaust, sovereign immunity, even potentially a Heck bar, those are all jurisdictional questions. And in my mind, that's an analytically different question than whether a mere dismissal for failure to state a claim without prejudice, that's more, did you do something where you didn't state a particular claim with enough particularity.
Whether it's immunity, Heck, or -- or failure to exhaust, you're making a legitimate claim.
There's another independent ground for not having you come to the court. The failure to state a claim without prejudice, however, is a different statement and a different issue.
I thought this case was just about the latter.
The question presented addresses only whether a dismissal without prejudice should be counted as a strike. Am I incorrect about that assumption? You're certainly correct about the question presented, but it -- it encompasses both types of dismissals.
I think there are two basic categories that would be encompassed in something that is being dismissed for failure to state a claim without prejudice. One is that there is just a pleading deficiency and that the court thinks it's potentially curable and, in some instances, you would have an amendment, maybe in other instances, the court might just elect to dismiss the claim without prejudice, but there's a separate category that is implicated by the facts of this case, where there are certain claims that are treated as being dismissed for failure to state a claim that are necessarily without prejudice because there is some procedural reason that prevents the court from reaching it. And -- and -- and to deal with the exhaustion example, this Court in the Jones v. Bock case interpreting the PLRA indicated that in some instances exhaustion would be dealt with under 12(b)(6). You take nothing from the fact that the bio wanted us to reframe this question and to include a question about whether Heck qualified as a dismissal for Heck purposes, which, frankly, there are two sets of splits out there, one on the question presented, whether a dismissal without prejudice or with prejudice should be treated as a strike, and there's a circuit split among the circuits as to whether a Heck dismissal is subject to a strike. We only granted on the first. That's -- that's right. There -- I mean, there are quite a few circuit splits involving the PLRA that are out -- that are outstanding. Exactly.
So you're -- you're asking us -- now I don't believe that I read anywhere -- and I purely understand that the litigant here was a pro se litigant -- Yeah. -- below.
You've gotten the record as it is.
But I don't think anywhere below he raised the Heck split question. No, that -- that's right.
We are taking as a -- as a given, and it's implicit in the question presented, that the dismissal was for failure to state a claim based on Heck.
That is how the Tenth Circuit consistently treats Heck dismissals. That is how -- and my understanding is the vast majority of circuits treat Heck dismissals as being something for failure to state a claim.
So we think this Court should be resolving that -- that question about whether a dismissal for failure to state a claim without prejudice, and it doesn't -- it doesn't need to reach the question of whether that's the proper way to characterize Heck. We think it probably is.
Heck itself refers to it in terms of whether there's a cognizable claim.
It's an -- it's an unusual circumstance because, given the bar, the statute of limitations doesn't begin to accrue for the claim until later, so it is something that is procedural in nature but, nonetheless, is often dealt with -- On your -- -- under the 12(b)(6) standard. -- excuse me -- on your upset the balance argument of the PLRA, how should we think about Rule 15, leave to amend, which is granted once as a matter of course in response to the responsive pleading, and then district judges often and have the discretion to grant further leave to amend, which occurred in this case and occurs also in other cases, of course? Sure.
I think we have two responses about Rule 15.
One is the answer I gave to the Chief Justice earlier, that to the extent their argument is don't worry about dismissals without prejudice because often the judges are going to have multiple opportunities to work with the litigant and he -- he will have a full opportunity to make sure he can state his claim.
It's not obvious that that is a better system or more consistent with the PLRA to avoid court congestion. The other answer is that it's not actually clear the extent to which Rule 15 operates in the PLRA context.
Most courts of appeals have held that it does.
There's -- there's one outlier. Suppose that it does, though. Sure. Then it does seem to mitigate some of the unfairness that you talk about that could occur from just routine correction of something in the complaint will usually happen or could happen under Rule 15 and often does happen. It -- it would mitigate the unfairness with respect to just pure pleading deficiencies.
Of course, Colorado points to local practices in Colorado about how prisoner complaints are treated.
There's no evidence that that is systematically applied across the country and that other district judges or magistrate judges are handling it in that way. But even that approach would not deal with the problem of failure to exhaust being a strike because that's not just an issue of allowing a repleading.
That's an issue where there is a procedural defect that is -- prevents the court from reaching the merits and something external in the world needs to happen. What's your understanding of how different district courts treat Rule 15 as compared to dismissals without prejudice? Is it your understanding, in other words, that Judge in Courtroom 1 will routinely do a dismissal without prejudice, Judge in Courtroom 2 will do grant leave to amend over and over again and not dismiss without prejudice, and -- and, if that's so, how should we think about that? My general sense is that, particularly dealing with prisoner cases, there's not a consistent practice across the board and across the country.
And I think that that is a reason to not treat a without-prejudice dismissal as being something that can result in a strike because it could be an instance in which it is a curable defect. And, in any event, as -- as I said, it's not obvious that it is a better system as far as the PLRA is concerned to force courts into the situation where they need to hold the litigant's hand to have multiple repeat opportunities to amend and keep the case on the docket before there could be a -- a final dismissal. I -- I do -- I did want to -- What is the standard that a district court applies in deciding whether to dismiss with or without prejudice, and is that enforced on appeal? The general standard -- so, again, I think there are two categories.
If -- if -- if there's an instance in which because -- there is a procedural defect that prevents the court from reaching the merits, it could be a jurisdictional issue, that necessarily has to be without prejudice. In an instance in which the question is whether -- is just a pleading issue that could potentially be cured with -- with new facts, I think generally the courts, the way courts deal with it is, if there is any ability to -- you know, amendment wouldn't be futile if there's not -- if there's a reason to think you could potentially provide more facts, that that should not be with prejudice. And -- And as to -- sorry. And if a court dismisses with prejudice, are there cases in which courts of appeals reverse that on the ground this should have been done without prejudice? There are certainly in the category of cases, for example, Heck dismissals or things that are -- But in the other category? In the cat -- they suggest that -- I mean, yes, usually it will be in -- in the context of this was not clearly -- there -- there should have been an opportunity to cure this.
And so amendment should have allowed or at least dismissal should have been without prejudice. I'm just wondering about the incentives that the rule that you're advocating will provide for district courts.
In deciding whether to dismiss with prejudice or without prejudice, if they have to take into account -- if I dismiss without prejudice, this is -- is going to enable this frequent litigator to continue to file, will -- do you have any concern that that's going to give them an incentive to label these dismissals with prejudice? That if -- no, I don't think so, because I think that would be reversible error if they are dismissing something with prejudice, without an opportunity to amend, and that there is a basis that -- in which the -- the complaint could be reformed to adequately state a claim.
So I -- I don't -- I don't -- I'm not concerned about that consequence. I do think the -- the fact that district courts are the ones handling these cases and have incentives to make sure that the dockets are being appropriately managed is an important one, but it supports our -- our view that, you know, to the extent there's a concern about repeat Heck claims, for example, being asserted repeatedly, the district courts have every ability to deal with that by dismissing them as frivolous or malicious -- Isn't that what happened here? -- in appropriate cases. I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg? Wasn't -- weren't there successive Heck claims here? There were two different Heck claims.
That's right.
It -- Well, you think the second one should have been dismissed as frivolous? I think the court would have well been within its discretion to potentially dismiss it as frivolous or malicious.
Of course, the way 1915(g) works is that it's looking to what the court actually did, not what could have been done.
That's the significance of the -- the language ""on the grounds that,"" that the United States relies on heavily.
It indicates -- That it would have been -- from a litigation fairness point of view, it would have been appropriate for the district court to say you brought a Heck claim once, we dismissed it, and now you did the same thing again, nothing has changed, so it's frivolous, out you go? That's -- that would have been an appropriate solution to this case? I -- I think -- I think the court would have been within its discretion to do that, and I think, going forward, if there's a clear rule that without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim do not result in a strike, in the category of cases like Heck that it is analytically something that is going to be without prejudice, courts can deal with that in the appropriate way by recognizing that, in some circumstances, it might be frivolous or malicious, but not every Heck-barred claim will be frivolous, and those that are not, that there's a real -- a good-faith argument about whether the Heck bar applies should not result in a strike because it's a -- But, here, it was the identical claim, right? There's nothing different in the second? I think that they were slightly different claims.
One focused on sentencing.
The other, I think, also did raise a sentencing issue but was focused on the prosecution and other issues involving the conviction. There's no question that there is considerable overlap.
And there's also, I think, very little question that a court could have determined that at least the second one had been frivolous or malicious, but the court did not do that.
And everyone here agrees that 1915(g) needs to be evaluated, whether a strike is to be imposed, based on what the court actually did, not what the court could have done. I want to talk again a little bit about dismissals based on a lack of exhaustion, which I think is an important example.
As this Court noted in Woodford, it is -- it was a central aspect of the PLRA, and yet, conspicuously, it's not included in 1915(g) as a reason for imposing a strike. Nonetheless, on the other side's view, any time that an exhaustion issue could be dealt with on a motion to dismiss basis, it is going to result in a strike, which we think is anomalous because it means in the circumstance in which the -- the litigant exhibited candor -- candor and saved the judicial resources because the exhaustion problem was apparent from the face of the complaint, that is going to result in a strike, but in the vast majority of the other instances, exhaustion is not treated as a strike, precisely because it is the type of procedural defect that does not implicate the merits of the claim, does not suggest any abuse of the courts. And we think it is an anomalous result of the other side's interpretation that that sort of dismissal is going to result in -- in a sanction. Why -- why do you assume that a procedural defect doesn't tax the resources of the -- of the court? And it's not just the court; it's the entire judicial system and -- and the, you know -- as I said, the service of process and all these other things.
Why is that? I mean, it's -- it's -- I guess the issue that you and Justice Ginsburg were talking about, if -- if it's been identified that you've got a Heck problem and then you go ahead and you file the same thing, that's still a procedural defect, but it is a -- I don't know if you want to say abusive, but it is the filing of a case that does not have the prospect of success at that time as filed, and from the point of view of the burdens on the -- on the system, I don't see why it shouldn't be regarded as a strike under 1915. I think it would be possible to have that view.
I don't disagree with the -- the proposition that it is taxing the court's resources, despite being a procedural defect, but, when you look at the structure of the statute, it does not seem like that is what Congress could have had in mind in 1915(g) because, again, dismissals based on jurisdictional problems or -- including sovereign immunity are going to have the exact same feature, except that they will almost certainly not be curable in a way that a failure to exhaust or a Heck bar might well be. Yet Congress did not impose a strike for those actions.
So it does not appear that Congress thought the thing that is sanction-worthy, that is going to potentially restrict a prisoner's future access to the court, is just filing an action that consumes judicial resources and can't succeed as filed. Instead, 1915(g) is targeting something more specific.
It's targeting actions that are meritless on their face or are frivolous or malicious, which are significant standards that -- Well, you can -- it -- it may seem odd, but you can -- you have frivolous cases that are dismissed as frivolous without prejudice, right? I mean, it -- it's -- if you've got the -- you're suing the wrong person, you thought Tom Smith was the guard that did this and it was Fred Jones instead, it could be characterized as frivolous because there's no possibility of success because the guy you're naming was, you know, off that day. And, yes, you -- and yet you -- you would probably want that to be without prejudice because the suit's, you know, completely compelling as long as you get the right guy. I agree with that. So the dichotomy that -- I don't know if there are three of them, what it's called, if it's a dichotomy -- between frivolous and failure to state a case -- a claim that you're trying to draw is -- is not as airtight as you suggest. I -- I -- I don't think that's right, because a dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction, for example, courts have recognized that that could be dismissed as frivolous because you could be making an argument that is just so -- it has no basis in the law that it deserves that sanction of being something that is an abuse of the courts, over and above filing an action that can't succeed because it's been filed in the wrong place. So frivolous and malicious provide courts with an opportunity to recognize -- even though this procedural defect goes above and beyond because there has been an abuse of the court process in a way that is not true of a normal -- normal assertion of this court has jurisdiction when it, in fact, does not.
We think that analogy applies perfectly to a Heck dismissal or a dismissal for lack of exhaustion. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text, structure, and history of the Prison Litigation Reform Act all support giving ""was dismissed"" its ordinary meaning in the three strikes provision.
The text is straightforward.
If a case was dismissed for failure to state a claim, it meets the statutory definition regardless of whether that dismissal was with or without prejudice because, in either circumstance, that case was dismissed, which is what the statute looks to. Second, the structure of the Act backs this ordinary meaning.
The Prison Litigation Reform Act uses the phrase ""failure to state a claim"" several times in its structure -- in its -- in its text.
Petitioner's proposed interpretation requires this Court to give that phrase one meaning in 1915(g), the three-strikes provision, and a different meaning in the rest of the Act.
That violates basic rules of statutory interpretation. In addition, the three-strikes use of the categories frivolous and malicious alongside the category fails to state a claim counsels, as the colloquy with Chief Justice -- the Chief Justice illustrates, that these provisions should be given similar scope.
Frivolous and malicious dismissals can be with and without prejudice.
The same scope should apply here. What results is an easily administrable rule to see what happened, rather than look and analyze the consequences. Finally, the history of the Act supports this reading.
This Court, in the Neitzke opinion in 1989, held that although it might be an appealing proposition, having sua sponte dismissals for failure to state a claim was inconsistent with the in forma pauperis statute in effect at that time. Congress responded to that suggestion in the Act a few years later, adding the opportunity for dismissals, sua sponte dismissals, and using the same language to count such dismissals as strikes. Suppose a prisoner files a suit and the district judge, instead of granting leave to amend, dismisses without prejudice; the prisoner corrects the error, fixes the defect, files a suit and prevails. Not only is it sufficient to state a claim, prevails in the case.
You would still say that that prisoner has a strike even though they won the case? Well, if it was -- we look at the statutory text, which says an action was dismissed. Yes. And if the first action was dismissed, even though they won a subsequent case on the same set of operative facts, it would be a different action, so that first strike would count. Of course -- Doesn't that strike you as odd, that you have a winning case and you get a strike under the PLRA? Well, no, it doesn't because Congress is look -- looking for an administrable rule.
And you look at the action itself, and as the discussion earlier, Justice Kavanaugh, illustrates, Rule 15 requires leave to amend to be freely given, where justice requires, whether or not it's as of right. And I think what we see in the District of Colorado certainly is a conversation back and forth between the -- the prisoner and the court before that dismissal occurs.
So there are -- I guess that raises another question, which is -- I alluded to earlier.
I don't know that that practice is uniform.
In fact, I'm pretty sure it's not uniform.
So a lot of district judges will grant leave to amend freely, but a number of others for a lot of reasons, clearing the docket and otherwise, will dismiss without prejudice. And yet those two things, which are functionally identical, for the prisoner, will be treated differently in terms of the strikes under your view, is that right? Yes, in -- in that circumstance. Does that -- does that make sense to treat those two functionally-identical things from the prisoner's perspective differently? It does under the text of the statute, which says -- which asks the courts to look at what happened to the action.
And if there is a clear rule from this Court that says a dismissal with and without prejudice falls under the statute, then -- then courts can adjust their behavior accordingly if they're concerned about giving the strike. Well, suppose we find the statutory language at least ambiguous.
Then do you have a response to Justice Kavanaugh's question? Well -- well, a clear rule on this will help courts adjust their behavior, so -- regardless of whether the text, the -- the statute is ambiguous or not, but, secondly, I think, given Rule 15, given the focus on amendment and fixing complaints rather than just dismissing them, I think a rule from this Court and -- and the ample tools that we have for courts to fix -- to find out if there is a way to state a claim before a dismissal, will not lead to unjust results. In fact, most circuits have the rule that we advocate here in -- in effect.
And -- Why wouldn't it lead to an unjust result? I mean, even if a dismissal is made without prejudice, for preclusion purposes, it doesn't bar a subsequent action.
If the prisoner has to pay, what, $400 upfront, it's effectively preclusive because he can't bring the action.
He hasn't got the money to do it. Well, three responses, Justice Ginsburg. First, it is a three-strikes provision, and prisoners -- every prisoner gets three non-meritorious on-their-face dismissals before the three-strikes provision applies. Secondly, under either rule, there are going to be some prisoners who are not going to be able to, after having three strikes, come to court and -- and seek redress without prepaying the filing fee. And, third, I think there are -- there's an exception in the statute for imminent bodily injury, imminent danger of bodily injury, excuse me, that allow for the -- the extreme cases to come through. What Congress was trying to do with the Prison Litigation Reform Act was reduce the amount of prisoner litigation that was coming to the court.
And they balanced, as the Chief Justice identified, the burdens that that prisoner litigation was putting on the courts with giving access to prisoners.
They get three strikes.
And, again, these strikes occur only when it's non-meritorious on their face. If it goes to summary judgment, if they lose at trial, if it's -- if it's dismissed for 12(b)(1) grounds, it doesn't count as a strike.
So only in this category of strikes do we see the dismissals count. And, yes, in any bright-line rule, there will be some examples that we can think of that fall on the other side of the rule that, if we were crafting policy ourself, we might say should be included in the policy. But what Congress did was put forth an easily administrable rule that says we look at what happened in the prior cases and were those prior cases dismissed for failure to state a claim, not looking at whether there was with prejudice or without prejudice. And this makes sense when you also look at the structure of the Act, because the structure of the Act says -- again, it uses failure to state a claim several times, and it says in the structure, several times, you, district court, have the authority and in some cases the obligation to screen cases and dismiss them if they fail to state a claim. And then, in 1915(g), it says: For those claims that were dismissed for failure to state a claim, those count as a strike.
And having that phrase mean the same thing throughout the Act is very important for statutory -- Mr. Olson, you're factually incorrect about one thing.
1915(g) doesn't say failure -- a dismissal of a complaint.
It talks about the dismissal of an action.
And I always understood the dismissal of a complaint with leave to refile is different than a dismissal of the action. That's correct, Justice Sotomayor. So, in those cases where there's a failure to state a claim but the court believes that there's the potential of a legitimate claim, it certainly has the right to dismiss the complaint but with leave to refile? Correct, the statute focused on an action. Now I think that was what Justice Kavanaugh was getting to, which is, and what your adversary is saying, that if a court erroneously -- and courts do do that erroneously, because one presumes if they say you can file a complaint without prejudice, it means -- and dismisses the action, that they're really saying the same thing: We're dismissing with leave to appeal.
I think that's your adversary's argument. And -- and that's what you're not getting to, which is why should we treat those differently? Treat the circumstance where there is a complaint dismissed? Yes.
Yes. But not the action? Well, why don't we read a dismissal of the action without prejudice to be the functional equivalent of dismissal of the complaint with leave to refile? Because that's what without prejudice means. Well, when we look at the text of the statute, it focuses on the action being dismissed.
And when you look at what happens in the mine-run of cases, these actions are dismissed.
Typically, if it's dismissed without prejudice, a couple of cases that Petitioner cites have this exact fact pattern, where there's a dismissal without prejudice and 30 days or 60 days given to file an amended complaint. No amended complaint is filed.
Then the action -- so the complaint was dismissed and after that failure the action is dismissed.
But it is still dismissed without prejudice. I -- I think, Mr. Olson, your answer suggests that there's a real reason why courts would pick one thing rather than the other, why they would dismiss the complaint with leave to amend on the one hand or dismiss the entire action without prejudice on the other. And what people are suggesting to you is maybe there's not a reason.
Maybe it just depends on the culture and practice of particular district courts.
Maybe in some district courts the incentives actually cut the other way. Some of my clerks who have clerked on the D.C. District Court suggested to me that the incentives all cut in favor of dismissing without prejudice, rather than giving leave to amend, because of the way they count their docket. So, if that's correct, if courts are doing this randomly or if some are subject to one set of incentives and others subject to an opposite set of incentives, but they're all trying to do the same thing, which is to deal with a complaint that has not pled sufficient facts and telling the person go do it again, why should we treat those two cases differently for purposes of counting strikes? Because the Prison Litigation Reform Act did not remove that broad discretion that all district courts have that, as you say, manifests itself in some difference in practice throughout the country. But what it did do was put forth in this text an administrable rule that was easy for one district court to determine what another district court did, and that easily administrable rule uses the language: An action was dismissed for failure to state a claim. Period.
It does not say without prejudice. Yeah, and I think, you know, there is a statutory argument, and we can talk about the statutory argument.
I don't want to poo-poo that at all.
It's important to go by statutory language. I -- I just want to -- if we think that the statute is ambiguous and allows for a result either way, why is your rule the better rule given that it -- it seems to treat two very similar cases from two courts where they're trying to do the same thing completely differently for purposes of the strike counting? It's a better rule because of its clarity and administrability.
It allows for no uncertainty for -- to determine what happened.
And it honors the scope of the other dismissal, so frivolous and malicious can be with and without prejudice.
And there are -- there are many examples where there can be some cases where it seems unfair that that was -- was applied, but it is an easily administrable rule. The -- the other rule is easily administrable as well, though, dismissal with prejudice.
If it's a dismissal without saying anything more or it says with prejudice, then that's the bright line. Well, it is administrable but -- but not in the broader context.
And as -- as the Chief Justice was pointing to earlier, it would allow the same litigant to file very similar cases over and over again with no penalty unless the court comes in, reviews what they've done, and says: Okay, this rises to the level of being frivolous. No, it just has to be dismissed with prejudice. The -- oh, sure.
That -- that would be the other way to address this. It's a fairly distinct point. You don't have to label it frivolous.
You can file, you get leave to amend, or it's dismissed without prejudice, it comes back, nope, dismissed again, this time with prejudice. But the problem with that approach is that the with prejudice, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, the preclusive effects are much, much greater than whether or not you have to pay your filing fee in installments. Right. And -- and with prejudice means that you cannot bring a case on those set of operative facts again. That's why district judges are going to be loath to do that right out of the box. Right.
But that's why I think that that rule would lead to more challenges in the district court and require district courts to spend much more time before they -- they -- they dismiss it. Here, under this rule, where with and without prejudice count as strikes, a district court can give prisoners some back and forth and say we haven't met -- the prisoner has not met the required threshold, I'm going to dismiss without prejudice, meaning that prisoner can bring that claim again if they do it better and develop more facts, but there is some consequence, which is the strikes. So that's why we think it's the more administrable -- Can -- -- and better rule. -- can I ask one related question? It's alluded to in Footnote 7 of the reply brief, which is, do you think the PLRA allows sua sponte dismissals without leave to amend? Well, as Mr. Burgess identified, I think the general practice is to -- to give amendment where it is required.
I don't know that -- that there's been a case that tests that thesis to the point. The better rule, we believe, under Rule 15 is that if there's an effort to amend, it should be granted if justice so requires. But if there's not -- and in this case, for instance, in the first two strikes -- I think you're saying then the PLRA should not be read to override Rule 15? Correct, yes.
I -- I do want to turn a little bit to the structural argument here, which is that the statute uses the same language several times.
And it would be very odd, as this Court just held in the Cochise Consultancy case, all but the most unusual circumstances require us to give the same meaning to the same phrase in the same statute. And we -- we see that here.
It provides strong reasons for having the strikes with -- count for those that are both with and without prejudice. And I guess I'd like to end by just saying that, as we've alluded to in this conversation, this statute has had real consequences for the number of frivolous lawsuits filed by prisoners.
It has reduced them substantially, as the states' amicus brief points out, and the filter of the Prison Litigation Reform Act has been effective over the years in making sure that the frivolous claims are reduced. Now they are -- prisoner claims are still a substantial part of the docket of the federal courts, around 10 percent of all civil claims filed.
And our respectful position is that the Court recognize the majority of the circuits who have held that failure to state a claim dismissals with and without prejudice should count as strikes under the -- the Act. If there are no further questions, I'll yield the remainder of my time. Thank you, counsel. General Rosen. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: What I would like to do is that while we maintain that all the usual tools of statutory construction point to affirmance, I want to return just briefly to the plain text of the PLRA for the simple reason that it is both the most important and we maintain it is alone, in this case, sufficient to resolve the case. We have a situation where we have an inmate in prison for a felony sexual assault who brought three actions during the period of 2013 and 2014, each of which was dismissed for failure to state a claim, which is one of the enumerated actions. And in Section 1915(g), the text of the statute says that if we have a -- a prisoner who, on three or more prior occasions while incarcerated, brought an action or an appeal in the courts of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, they are barred, they are subject to the three-strikes rule. So, as in the Coleman case, we have a situation where it is literally what the words of the statute say.
And as in Coleman, we are confronted with a question of whether the language should have an exception or should be construed to be read with things that are not actually in the text. Well, it's -- it's a little more ambiguous than that.
Failure to state a claim can mean two different things. It can mean failure to state a claim with prejudice or failure to state a claim without prejudice, and the consequences of that distinction obviously are very significant. So I'm -- I'm not sure -- I understand your textual argument.
I'm not sure that that's the end of the case, though. So, respectfully, I might say I don't think it's -- that it can mean either.
It can mean both, that the -- the plain language encompasses both dismissals with prejudice and dismissals without prejudice. And, indeed, in the -- the Petitioner's reply brief, they acknowledged as much, that this language, failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or dismissal on that basis, encompasses both. But, General, when -- when an action is dismissed for failure to state a claim, it's always a dismissal with prejudice unless the order says something otherwise.
So you might say what -- there are two categories and the categories are dismissals and dismissals without prejudice.
And if somebody sometimes says dismissals with prejudice, they're just adding unnecessary words because, if it was just a dismissal, if a court just dismisses, it's going to be a dismissal with prejudice. So the ""with prejudice"" part is superfluous, you might say, and when Congress just says dismissals, all it's choosing to do is not inject a superfluity into the statutory language. Well, the -- the word ""dismissal"" encompasses both.
We know in this case there were three dismissals of the actions on the -- on the grounds that were enumerated. The question of whether Rule 41 should be read in, I would suggest, doesn't make sense for two reasons.
One is that the -- as a statutory interpretive tool, we have plain text. I maintain that it's not ambiguous, but even if one thought it was, I think we would look to Rule 12, which provides the -- the same language, failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, and it is understood that that can include with or without prejudice. I don't think there's any reason to go to the language of Rule 41 because its language dealing with what counts as an adjudication on the merits is not language in the statute.
So I don't see that it actually provides interpretive benefit. And then, secondly, as -- But Congress writes its statute against a backdrop of the way people use language.
And, here, the way people use language is that a dismissal on a 12(b)(6) motion, a simple dismissal, is a dismissal with prejudice.
And you don't have to say with prejudice. So Congress, responding and acting against that backdrop, says all we need to do is say dismissal to have a dismissal with prejudice because there's really no such thing as a dismissal -- you -- you never have to use those three words together in the way courts operate. You don't have to, but you are permitted to do it either way.
And they both count as 12(b)(6) motions that are granted. And I think the -- the backdrop, if we're really to look at the backdrop of what Congress was focused on, we should really look at this Court's decisions in the Neitzke and the Denton cases, where the Court had said that a dismissal for -- in Neitzke said that a dismissal for frivolous grounds does not include the set of those that are dismissed for failure to state a claim.
So Congress is partly responding to that.
And then, in Denton, the Court had said that a -- a dismissal for frivolousness under the prior version of -- of the language in the IFP statute had said it could be with or without prejudice. So Congress knew the background in using one of those enumerated grounds at least was with both. It -- it -- And -- -- as I mentioned to your -- your friend on the other side, the list of terms you have there, frivolous, malicious, failure to state a claim, the first two are plainly pejorative.
I mean -- I mean, the -- the -- the -- the system does impose -- filings that aren't meritorious impose costs on the system.
But, at the same time, the words are -- are of a different character. I mean, if you -- if you file -- if your case is thrown out because it's frivolous or malicious, that's one thing.
If -- if it's thrown out because of a failure to state a claim, when you report that to your -- your -- your colleagues back at the -- the firm, they're going to say, well, is it without prejudice or with? And if you say it's without prejudice, they -- they're not going to think you're a bad lawyer.
I mean, they're just going to think that you've got to refile after something else happens. Precisely.
And so, when Congress, in adding the language on failure to state a claim, was expanding the type of claims that judges would be positioned to dismiss under the PLRA and was not saying they have to be those that are -- are vexatious in some manner. They can be those that are simply deficient. And that takes me to I think what is an important point I do want to get to, is if we look at the -- the dismissals in this case, two of them are Heck dismissals, and there's a suggestion that these are without prejudice, as Heck dismissals normally are in -- in most circuits, because of their -- their status. The inmate here, who, as I say, was in prison for a felony conviction on sexual assault, he files a lawsuit in 2013 against five judges, two prosecutors, and the claims are that -- that he was deprived of proper bail, proper speedy trial, the sentence was no good and that he was denied a -- a -- an appeal. And that's a Heck dismissal.
It's a failure to state a claim because no relief can be granted on that.
Nor is there any likelihood that in the future this prisoner is likely to be able to cure that, that is to say, there's no indication that he has a habeas petition that's been ruled on favorably or the like. So it can be styled as a procedural issue, but, for all practical purposes, it's likely to ever change, but it's without prejudice.
And the consequence -- and I think this goes to a question Justice Kavanaugh asked -- is why would it be a -- a better rule, I think you asked of my colleague from Colorado? Why would it be a better rule is because, if we say that ones without prejudice are not going to be strikes, that means, in effect, Heck dismissals will not count as strikes and inmates may file an unlimited number, in terms of not paying a filing fee, an unlimited number of IFP actions without consequence. And common sense will tell you that instead of the statutory purpose, which is to have fewer but better claims, we will wind up with an unlimited number of Heck -- Well, I suppose -- -- Heck actions. -- I suppose in that scenario at some point the filings would become malicious. At -- at some point. There's obviously precedent from this Court in the In Re McDonnell and subsequent cases where some of the excessive litigants have come to this Court and the Court has said enough, and lower courts have done something similar, but those are really aberrations.
Those are not the norm.
And nor would we want the system to have to bear -- General -- -- that. -- the system bears that anyway, given that at least your co-counselor or counsel on the -- on your side argue that courts are free to permit litigants to amend their complaints. Litigants can do exactly that.
They can avoid the filing fee and they can avoid dismissal by continuously amending and some courts permit it.
At some point, they get tired and they dismiss with prejudice. That would happen the same with inappropriate Heck dismissals.
As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you dismiss one.
The court tells you Heck bars you.
And you refile it again with no change, and the court is going to dismiss it as frivolous. You -- you may answer briefly. Thank you. Respectfully, the history since the PLRA was enacted shows -- shows otherwise.
At its zenith, 25 percent of the civil docket of -- of the federal courts were prisoner filings, and it is now down to about 10 percent.
It's still a very large number, approximately 29,000 a year ago, but it's from 20 -- 25 percent to 10 percent. And in the majority of circuits, I think it's six of eight that have ruled on this, the rule is both with and without prejudice count. Thank you, General. Four minutes, Mr. Burgess. Thank you.
I'd like to make a few quick points. First, Mr. Olson a number of times in his presentation referred to 1915(g) referring to -- dealing with actions that were dismissed as non-meritorious on their face.
They make the same point in their brief. But it is very odd to refer to a dismissal without prejudice that may be based on purely a procedural defect as suggesting the claim is non-meritorious on its face. And I suggest the reason they need to characterize it that way is precisely along the lines that the Chief Justice alluded to.
The other phrases in 1915(g) are referring to actions that are clearly abusive, malicious, or frivolous. So it does not fit with the structure of the statute to think that actions that are being dismissed without prejudice and that might be on a purely procedural ground should receive a sanction under 1915(g). I'd like -- also like to address the United States' argument about the literal text of the statute and the idea that, well, it just says failure to state a claim, we shouldn't be reading in another provision.
But that doesn't take full account of the fact that this is a term of art. And this Court in Woodford, for example, where it was interpreting the phrase ""exhaust,"" the argument was made, well, that doesn't include proper exhaustion.
And the Court said, nevertheless, ""exhaustion"" is a legal term.
We know what it means.
So it would have been redundant for Congress to have to say proper exhaustion. We think the same applies here in the particular context where you're dealing with what a court interprets a prior dismissal. And for that reason, we think the Coleman decision supports us because Coleman, in addition to relying on the plain language, relied on the ordinary background principles of Civil Rules of Procedure. And, here, the ordinary background rule is that, while Rule 12(b), an authorization provision, allows for a dismissal with or without prejudice, when you are determining the impact of -- of a dismissal after it has previously been entered, it is -- there's a conclusive presumption that it is with prejudice. So we think Congress would have understood it that way.
And that fully explains the -- the difference between why the phrase is being interpreted one way in 1915(g) as opposed to the screening provisions, which mirror 12(b) in authorizing dismissal. Another point I'd like to make is I didn't hear a good response to Justice Kavanaugh's question as to why there would be a good reason to treat differently actions that -- instances in which a court allows amendment and then dismisses versus instances in which the court decides, well, I'm just going to dismiss this entire action without prejudice. And the other side's argument seems to rely on the notion that courts will by and large apply Rule 15 and allow multiple amendments.
As I indicated before, it's not clear that that is a preferable system.
And I think it's also not clear that that is consistent with the text of the PLRA. When you look at the screening provisions, in particular 1915(e) and 1997(e), they speak in terms of requiring the court to dismiss the action or the case. So the idea that they can cure the problem that their reading has by saying, well, courts are going to allow multiple amendments, so you don't have to worry about instances in which there is a without-prejudice dismissal, I don't think is consistent with how the -- the Act works as a whole. The final point I'd like to make is that the other side alluded multiple times to the -- how many prisoner suits there were and that they've decreased. As we noted in our reply brief, there's no indication that there is any different pattern in the Third or Fourth Circuit.
The Fourth Circuit has had this rule for over a decade and there's no indication that by adopting a clear rule that without-prejudice dismissals do not qualify as strikes, that there's been any significant uptick in prisoner litigation. If the Court has no further questions, we urge you to reverse. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear first this morning in Case 18-1086, Lucky Brand Dungarees versus Marcel Fashions Group. Ms. Cendali. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should reverse the Second Circuit because it erred in holding that a defense never previously litigated to judgment can be barred in a case involving new claims. This Court rejected that idea over a hundred years ago in Cromwell and Davis, and as this Court unanimously made clear more recently in Taylor v. Sturgell, the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue preclusion, which forecloses relitigation of issues actually litigated and resolved, and claim preclusion, which forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim. Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free to argue any previously unresolved defense it may have to new claims.
This rule is right for three reasons: First, it follows from this Court's precedent, including Cromwell, Davis, and Taylor. Second, the rule is easy to administer as courts and litigants are accustomed to applying these bedrock principles of issue and claim preclusion. Third, it's fair and protects due process interests. To be clear, we are not arguing that defenses may never be barred under existing law. Issue preclusion could bar a previously resolved defense.
And previously unresolved defenses cannot be raised in the context of a judgment enforcement action or as a claim in an action collaterally attacking a prior judgment. But none of these circumstances are present here.
As the Second Circuit held in the first appeal in this case, Marcel I, Marcel is pursuing new claims as it seeks relief for alleged subsequent infringement.
Thus, this Court should reverse, as the Second Circuit's novel test precluded a never-resolved defense in an action asserting new claims in conflict with settled and sensible principles of claim and issue preclusion. Moreover, the Second Circuit's new test is a bad idea. Before we get to that, Ms. Cendali, could you explain why you abandoned the release defense in the first action? You did raise it, and then you dropped it.
And it's a bit of a mystery why you did. We don't know exactly why it was abandoned, but it -- the most logical answer is that it would not have been dispositive.
The amount in controversy -- the -- the compensatory damages in that case was only $20,000, and we know that the release would not have applied to use of ""Get Lucky,"" which is what the primary thrust of what the case was about.
So it may not have been worth it from a cost-benefit analysis to renew a release to -- a defense that would not have been dispositive of the -- the issues before -- before the court. How would it have -- it seems strange when that release said, Lucky, you can't use ""Get Lucky,"" but you're continuing to use it.
The release said you can't use ""Get Lucky."" On the other hand, we won't go after you for Lucky Brand.
And the first case, as you just said, concentrated on ""Get Lucky."" And the release seemed to me to be no use at all to ""Lucky"" as far as ""Get Lucky"" is concerned because it agrees that it would stop using ""Get Lucky."" That's exactly our point, Your Honor.
Because the release would not have been helpful with regard to ""Get Lucky,"" it -- it -- it -- it wasn't going to be dispositive of the case.
And, therefore, it may have not been worth the cost of briefing it again -- again, the compensatory damages were $20,000 -- if it wasn't going to end the whole case because the release would have only applied to a narrow subset of the trademarks that they were accusing us of using before the court.
But -- I take it from your introductory remarks that you do not agree with the Restatement rule that, although the failure to raise a defense in a prior action generally does not preclude the raising of the defense in a subsequent action, there is an exception where prevailing on the defense in the second action would nullify the initial judgment or impair rights established in the initial action.
Do you -- do you reject that rule? No, Your Honor.
And -- and that's a key point.
As I said in my introduction, if this were a judgment enforcement action or if we were trying to collaterally attack the prior judgment, we would be barred. Well, I understood you to say that there would be an exception if it was an attack on the judgment, a collateral action attacking the judgment, or if it was the basis of a claim. But this goes further.
It says that a defense may be barred in a subsequent action if it would have the effects that I mentioned.
So do you agree with that or not? We agree with the restatement, but, again, it supports us in this case because, to be clear, Marcel is getting and keeping all of the relief it got in the first action.
It got the $300,000.
It got the injunction it got.
It got the declaration for that period of time. What we're talking about is subsequent conduct presenting new claims where they're trying to get additional relief and a broader injunction, a deprivation of property that we never had a chance to defend with regard to these claims. But suppose the subsequent conduct were identical in all ways to the prior conduct.
And I know you think that that's not true, that there are different marks involved, and that the conduct has changed. But suppose that it were identical in all ways.
It's just that it's after the prior judgment.
So there was no -- there were no damages collected for the subsequent conduct because it hadn't happened yet. In that case, could you have brought the defense? No.
And the reason we could -- could not have brought the -- the -- the defense is the only thing before the court in the first action, the 2005 action, was the facts and circumstances at that particular period of time. A court could not -- it would be an improper advisory opinion to say: And, well, with regard to future conduct, that would be bad too. The way courts deal with that is via injunctions.
In other words, if the court wanted to address and prevent the current conduct, it would have issued an injunction that pertained to the current conduct.
Instead, the injunction that it issued was limited to use of ""Get Lucky"" or colorable imitations thereof that they -- they tried to make by making a motion for contempt earlier in this case in Marcel I to try to have that injunction read broader, but they were denied. So if -- if I understand what you're saying, in the case of identical subsequent conduct, if it violates the injunction, then you're out of luck? Correct. But if it does not -- if there's no injunction or it does not violate the injunction for some way -- in some way, then you can do whatever you want; is that correct? Well, you can do whatever you want subject to the fact you might get -- get sued again.
You'd have to have a -- you -- No, I'm sorry.
I -- I -- But you wouldn't be precluded. Yes. That -- that -- that is -- that is right.
But that's consistent with -- with, I think, the very unremarkable proposition that new -- subsequent conduct, subsequent infringing conduct, is a -- is a new claim -- But that's -- -- as -- as you all -- -- inconsistent with the restatement rule.
So you really don't agree with the restatement rule? Your Honor, perhaps I am not fully understanding it, but -- but my understanding of the restatement rule is based on the idea of -- of attacking the previous action or upsetting the judgment. I think the proper Restatement rule to be helpful here is the Restatement of Judgment Section 18, which makes clear, in a section titled Merger, that defenses that attempt to upset the judgment rendered are barred. Well, that's -- That's not -- That's one -- that's one section of the restatement that deals with this problem.
And of course, the restatement might not be right.
It's not -- you know, we don't have to accept it, but -- Well, the -- I -- I have a question about interpreting the judgment in the 2005 action, which I think we have to do in order to come to grips with this case.
It could be interpreted possibly in one of two ways. There is a seeming discrepancy between the final judgment and in the injunction.
The injunction applies only to ""Get Lucky"" whereas the -- you can read the judgment to apply to a lot of other brands as well, a lot of other marks as well. So my -- my question is: Is there a -- does the district court's -- the way district court framed the injunction necessarily reflect its interpretation -- let me back up. Does the way the district court framed the injunction necessarily indicate the way it interpreted the -- the -- the -- the jury's verdict or would there be grounds under trademark law for the district court to issue an injunction that is narrower than the jury's verdict? The -- that was discussed in a well-reasoned opinion, obviously not binding on this court, by Judge Leval in Marcel I where he said that because the declaration was phrased in the conjunctive, you couldn't -- it would be sheer speculation to say that that meant that the jury found that it was just use of ""Get Lucky"" by it's -- use of -- of the word ""Lucky,"" the name on our stores for 30 years, was -- was infringing by itself. And we know that from how they tried the case, which is why the -- the district court and everyone understood it is they admit, Respondents admit at pages 9 and 10 of their brief, the focus of the case was not just on the use of ""Get Lucky"" but on the use of ""Get Lucky"" causing confusion with -- because of the commingling of words with ""Lucky"" with ""Get Lucky."" Well, I understand. That was -- That was -- -- the argument to the jury. That's a -- that's a plausible, maybe the best interpretation of the -- the meaning of the box that the jury checked on the verdict sheet.
But two things.
All that was held, right, in Marcel I, was that there wasn't a -- there wasn't enough to show that the injunction had been violated and, therefore, not enough to hold -- not enough for a contempt holding. Am I right? Well -- That's what was held. It -- it held that, yes, that the -- that the contempt ruling by the district court in denying contempt to preside it over the case and is in the best position to know what she was intending to enjoin, and knew that the closing argument to the jury was -- I think it was at 852 of the trial transcript, was -- was what's causing confusion is the use of ""Get Lucky"" with these other marks. Can you explain how Lucky -- I take it was represented by other counsel -- allowed that strange question that asked: ""Get Lucky,"" ""Lucky Brand,"" any other use of the word ""Lucky,"" strung them all together and the jury, in order to find that ""Get Lucky"" had been used and infringed, would have to answer yes. How did you -- the judge, I assume, informed the attorney of the questions that would be asked on the special verdict sheet, right? I -- I think that they all understood it because it was consistent by grouping them all together like that with the theory that the case was argued.
They -- they essentially had two claims: You can't use ""Get Lucky,"" those actual words, and -- and it's also causing confusion to use ""Get Lucky"" with these other words. So actually that -- that language, that instruction, that grouping was pressed not by Lucky's counsel, but by Marcel's counsel, because that fit their theory of the case.
And they should -- they can't now, having pressed that theory of -- of the case, and gotten the language that they wanted, now try to argue that it means something else. But -- but I -- but I -- I also am concerned, though, that we -- we need to get back to the -- the -- with -- with respect, with permission, with the -- the -- the legal issue of the -- the problems with this new test that the Second Circuit has put forth because it is a bad idea.
It's a bad idea for at least four reasons: One, it will create uncertainty because you'll never know whether you're going to be excused or not from a claim being released -- from failing to press a defense, forgive me. Second, it's going to lead to new litigation.
People are going to feel compelled to press defenses.
And I can assure you that district court judges are not enamored of people who come in with a laundry list of affirmative defenses that need to be resolved. And then, even after that happens, then what happens? Then let's say you don't raise a defense.
Then there's an ancillary motion practice and proceeding where a judge has to consider what happened in the previous case that they may not have been involved with.
It would also then lead to mischief by plaintiffs who might say, let's bring a small case, which arguably this case is, and then bring a bigger case after that. And it's also just fundamentally not fair.
It's not symmetrical.
It's not even-handed because it lets a plaintiff bring new claims, but it prohibits a defendant from raising all the defenses that they may have to those claims. Just as these new claims did not exist at the time of 2005 action, so too -- and they could not have brought them, well, we really could not have brought the defense to those claims because those claims are new. And -- and I think that was the reasoning of this Court way back in 1877 in Cromwell. Counsel, you raise a point about the lack of symmetry here that would be created.
I suppose we could remedy that, couldn't we, and say that if a plaintiff had a claim in time 2 that was available, similar to the one in time 1, just as here, and could have brought a cause of action but forgot to do so in time 1, it should be barred from doing so in time 2. Would that -- would that solve the asymmetry problem? I think, Your Honor, if I'm understanding your correction correctly, what you're really, as I hear it, talking about the ordinary application of claim preclusion, which means that -- Well, no, it's a new claim, you would say, right, because it involves new -- new facts, right, and new infringements but, yeah, there was a cause of action they could have brought, right, you know, a breach of contract claim rather than just a trademark claim, but maybe they shouldn't be allowed to bring that in time 2. Well, that would be a -- a -- another let's-litigate-everything rule so that -- It would -- it would be quite an extension of claim -- claim preclusion in another direction but it would at least solve the asymmetry problem. Right, but to no good end. Okay. I mean, this -- this was a -- I mean, it really seemed like the court in Marcel II was -- was annoyed that prior counsel didn't raise this defense and I can appreciate that. But that doesn't mean that this Court needs to reconfigure the entire law of claim and issue preclusion in this case in this country. But -- and there's no reason to do it, because as the reasons thought in Cromwell in this Court in a very thoughtful opinion by Justice Field in 1877, you know, the Court took the time to -- to survey exhaustively all prior law of -- of -- of what we now call issue and claim preclusion. And while he talked about demand instead of claim, he -- he -- he juxtaposed in his opinion for the Court the two types of preclusion that we deal with today: The idea that once you have litigated a case, you can't -- you're foreclosed from raising defenses to undermine that case's resolution, but if it's something that you haven't litigated, that would not foreclose you in a subsequent case involving new claims. Ms. -- Just -- Could I go back and figure out what's going on between the parties? In your reply brief, you say, even disregarding the facts that these are -- that we're dealing with a different time period, we're actually dealing with a different set of -- of -- of claims. Correct. Because you have stopped using the Get Lucky brand, so that the claims that the Respondent now has against you have nothing to do with ""Get Lucky."" Is that what -- That's correct, Justice Kagan. So -- I mean, that would be a kind of narrow and easy way to solve this case if it were true, and if it were not waived in any way, but why did you only bring that to our attention in your -- in -- why did you only make that a central feature of your argument in the reply brief? Because that was sort of to our surprise the -- the focus of their -- I mean, the key thing is that our friends did not defend or cite any cases saying a previous court has ever accepted the thinking of Marcel II whereby a never-litigated defense can be precluded in an action involving new claims. Rather, they focused its brief on saying, well, these are actually old -- old claims.
And that's why we addressed it then. We -- the whole predicate of this case, the whole opinion that -- that Marcel II, that is -- is -- is based on was the -- the court in Marcel II acknowledging and citing the decision of Judge Leval in Marcel I that this was new claims because it involved a subsequent course of conduct. Once they raised it, we then properly responded it -- to it in reply.
And as we said in our reply brief, there's three reasons -- I mean, the key thing is to decide the issue of law, but in terms of the new claim issue, I think this Court can easily dispose of that for three reasons. One, they argued exactly the contrary, arguing that these were new acts, new claims, new circumstances in Marcel I, so if there is an estoppel here, it's judicial estoppel to them in changing their position now, having gotten to court and being here because of that. And then, second, Judge Leval's decision, not binding on this Court, but was clearly right because it stood for the unremarkable proposition that subsequent acts create new claims.
And that's also consistent with Asetek in patent law, in this Court's accrual cases like MGM versus Petrella in the copyright context, where each act of infringement is a new claim for accrual purposes. And then, finally, yes, there is the factual point that Your Honors have been asking about, which is when the whole theory admittedly of the first case was about the juxtaposition of -- of ""Get Lucky,"" the use of ""Get Lucky,"" and the juxtaposition of ""Get Lucky"" with other things causing confusion, in a new case, in a new period of time, not before the court, not the possibly before the court, that admittedly did not use ""Get Lucky,"" that's a very different circumstance. Could they -- Can you tell -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Can you tell me what the theory is, what you think the 2005 settlement -- or 2003 settlement agreement means? Sure. Can you sort of -- I can't tell whether you think it means that Marcel has no claims against Lucky Brand for using ""Lucky Brand,"" but you have claims against them for their using ""Get Lucky""? No. All right.
So -- It -- it doesn't mean that.
What it means is what the district court held it to mean.
If -- it's a nice summary of it in its decision granting our motion to dismiss, which led to the appeal in Marcel II. And what it means is that in exchange for $650,000, my client, Lucky, agreed not to use ""Get Lucky"" anymore, but that for any trademarks that it had registered or used prior to the date of the settlement agreement, which would include ""Lucky Brand,"" the name of our store, and other kinds of things like -- other enumerated things, any trademarks that used the word ""Lucky"" prior to that date, all future claims would be extinguished. So, in other words, what that would mean, and the benefit of the bargain that we're trying to achieve is, absolutely, we can't use ""Get Lucky"" anymore.
But under the principles of the policy of supporting settlement agreements, we should be allowed the benefit of our bargain and being able to have protection for our house mark and the other pre-May 2001 uses and registrations that they had. So the settlement agreement doesn't -- it's not an offensive document.
They can continue to use their sole registered trademark, ""Get Lucky,"" to their hearts' content.
The issue -- And so you can use ""Lucky Brand"" and any other trademark you had registered as of that date, to your heart's content? Exactly, Your Honor. And it's that benefit of the bargain that we're being deprived of.
And Lucky -- I mean Marcel effectively got a partial windfall in -- in the 2005 action.
Most of that case was about ""Get Lucky,"" but if some small piece of it involved one of the released -- released marks, they got -- some of that $20,000 went for that, but now they're trying to -- to get a perpetual windfall and say that they get to bring, even though they didn't get an injunction, additional new claims when we are foreclosed from bringing a defense that was never fully litigated to judgment and would not be barred by issue preclusion. Your Honor, were you trying to ask a question? Yes, thank you. The other side likens this case to a judgment enforcement action.
You've -- you've alluded to that.
Just so we're clear, what makes something, in your view, a judgment enforcement action and why doesn't this qualify? What makes something a judgment enforcement action is when they're trying to get the relief they had been previously been awarded.
And the relief that they previously were awarded was the $300,000 and the injunction with regard to that we can't use ""Get Lucky"" or a colorable invitation -- imitation of that. What this action is about is we want more money, we want a -- a broader injunction; we don't want you to use anything with the ordinary English word ""Lucky"" in it.
And -- You said before a judgment enforcement action and a collateral attack on a judgment.
Do you view those as different things? They're really -- technically, they're different, but they go to the same thing.
I mean, claim preclusion is all about the concept -- as we -- as we know from Taylor v. Sturgell, is the -- is the modern word we use for part of -- of -- of res judicata. And so what -- what that's about is the idea that once the action was decided, nobody can undo it.
The plaintiff can't sue again and get additional relief -- may I finish the -- the statement? Sure. And the -- and the defendant is -- is -- cannot be -- attack a judgment once obtained. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kimberly. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Imagine a dispute between two parties is resolved with a final judgment on the merits. Our position is that in any subsequent lawsuit between the same parties, just as the plaintiff is precluded from raising any claims springing from the same cause of action if those claims were available to it in the prior suit, so too the defendant is precluded from raising any defenses to that cause of action if those defenses were available to it in the prior suit. This rule is fair and symmetrical.
It preserves judicial resources by discouraging repeat lawsuits, and it fosters reliance on final judgments. Now, Lucky's response to this, as I understand it over the last 25 minutes and its reply brief, is not really to deny the substance of our rule but, instead, to deny that this case and the prior case involved the same cause of action. But that can't possibly be correct. Indeed, there could be no clearer example of two cases involving the same cause of action than one in which the second suit alleges post-judgment violations of the exact same legal rights that were settled by the final judgment in the first lawsuit, based on a course of conduct that is alleged to be a continuation of the exact same conduct as before. And that's exactly what Marcel alleges here.
Now, Lucky says that these allegations are wrong and, in fact, that this case depends on different facts supporting different theories of trademark infringement. And there are two responses to this. The first is that Lucky is ignoring that this is an appeal from a motion to dismiss, meaning the allegations of the complaint have to be taken as true.
And at paragraph 25 of the complaint, reproduced at JA 62, and this is one among many such examples, Marcel alleges plaintiffs can be, quote, ""Lucky continues to this day to use the Lucky Brand marks in the identical manner that was found to be infringing upon plaintiffs rights and interests in the first action."" I don't think the Court has to look further than that.
Now, if the Court does feel that it does need to look further than that, I think all it needs to do is look at the judgment. Mr. -- Before we -- go ahead. Before we do that, it seems to me that -- that perhaps the most serious difficulty with your case that cries out for an answer before getting to the judgment is that it does require counsel to put forth in the first case every conceivable defense that he or she might have. And I can't imagine a rule that would be -- would make sense.
In other words, if you've got five defenses and you think three are really good; two, who knows; you still have to put in those other two if you want to ever be able to raise that defense again.
And it's a particular problem in this area of the law because you're often dealing with ongoing disputes between two parties. Your Honor, that would be true only with respect to subsequent suits involving the same nucleus of operative fact, the same claims.
It would not be true with respect to subsequent litigation between the parties on different causes of action. I don't follow -- I don't follow your argument about same claim because I thought everybody agrees that the claim that Marcel is bringing in the second action is not the same claim.
It's a different claim because it involves events that occurred after the judgment, so there's no claim preclusion.
There's no claim preclusion in this case.
The plaintiff is the one against whom claim preclusion operates. And there, I think all agree, claim preclusion is not an issue.
There is this new idea of defense preclusion, but there surely is not claim preclusion.
I think we can agree on that. The first action deals with a certain period of time and certain conduct within that period of time.
The second action deals with conduct after the first case is over and it is a different claim.
I thought that it -- it is clear that there is no claim preclusion in this case. Your -- Your Honor, it is clear that there's no claim preclusion in this case but it is not because they are different causes of action.
There is no question that if the claims under the assertion of damages, the facts underlying -- The course of action means a claim for relief.
A course of action is a claim.
And if you take the federal rules, federal rules refer never to cause of action, the expression is claim for relief. So call -- call it a claim, call it a cause of action, call it a common nucleus of operative facts.
That is, I think, the unit that matters for res judicata purposes. There is no question that if the facts giving rise to these claims had arisen pre-judgment, they would be precluded precisely because they are -- precisely because they do arise from a common nucleus of operative fact. The reason that claim preclusion does not apply in this case and that Marcel may prosecute its post-judgment claims is not because they arise from a different nucleus of operative fact.
It's because these claims were unavailable to it -- Well, how -- how do they -- -- in the prior claim. -- not arise from a different nucleus of operative fact? I mean, there are two problems.
One problem is the one that Justice Ginsburg raised, it happened afterwards.
The facts of -- are different because it's a different time period.
So it's a different transaction or occurrence.
It's a different nucleus of operative fact, however you want to phrase the -- the -- the -- the test, it would seem you're no longer in the same world. And then even more than that, even if you said, well, if everything else is identical and only the timing has changed, maybe we can still say it's the same claim.
Here everything else is not identical because Lucky has stopped using ""Get Lucky."" Right. It's continuing to use its Lucky Brand and the -- and the -- the reference you made to your complaint says it's continuing to use its Lucky Brand in the same way, but it's not using ""Get Lucky."" And that was a core part of the operative facts that gave rise to the first claim, isn't it? So, yes, as to one bucket of the claims.
It was factually relevant to the -- a second bucket of claims and it would be factually relevant in this case.
So let me -- and there were a few parts to your point there, and let me take on the first about different time periods. The point here is that this was a continuing course of conduct.
So the litigation in 2005 covered a wide range of time, up to the time of the final judgment in May 2010. Liability in this case is alleged to commence the day after the judgment in June 2010. So it isn't as though this is -- this is just a sort of a different point on the spectrum of a continuing course of conduct.
So the facts now are no different than were the facts between two different days within the period -- Well -- -- of time that was -- -- except for the fact, counsel, that if it were identical, you would just go enforce the judgment.
But you tried that and failed here.
So I guess I'm stuck where Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg are in -- in that this looks like a different claim. And I think you've actually, candidly, acknowledged that this is a different claim and it isn't precluded by claim preclusion, it's got to be something else. And the something else you hint at page 20 of your brief, you talk about a defendant who loses in one lawsuit may not raise in a subsequent lawsuit involving the same cause of action. Right. Which I think of as a legal theory, that's how I think of it, at least, as opposed to a claim which involves the facts, a defense that was available in the first lawsuit.
Okay? So I wonder, well, you know, that's a little asymmetrical, right? The defense -- the defendant loses a defense.
Why wouldn't the plaintiff also lose the cause of action and -- and wouldn't we then be inviting the same sorts of inefficiencies that the Chief Justice was speaking of earlier requiring a plaintiff to bring every cause of action in a $20,000 lawsuit involving a different set of facts that it might bring in a very similar -- Right. -- cause of action later in time 2. I want to be sure to come back to Justice Kagan -- Kagan's question. I think we're asking the same sort of thing from -- Well, let -- let me answer just first as to this -- this question about, well, maybe you wouldn't want to litigate all your defenses in a case involving a small amount in controversy.
That may be true, the -- So -- and the same thing's true for a plaintiff, though.
You might not want to bring all your causes of action in a first lawsuit.
You might -- might keep it simple one.
It's a small lawsuit.
You might throw in more causes of action in a later lawsuit that involves more money, for example, right? Well, that's exactly right.
But claim -- claim preclusion recognized that -- Wouldn't want that to be barred.
That would be a bad thing if that were barred, right? If -- if a plaintiff were barred from raising claims arising from a common nucleus of -- Bringing a new cause of action, a new legal theory in time 2 for similar but different later -- No, of course, Your Honor, but, of course -- You wouldn't want that to be barred. I have to resist that the -- these -- these claims don't concern a common nucleus of operative fact.
And so let me get to that in my -- in the second part of my answer to your question, Justice Kagan. There were two categories of claims in this case.
There were claims concerning Lucky's use of ""Get Lucky"" and there were claims concerning the likelihood of confusion between the ""Lucky Brand"" marks and Marcel's ""Get Lucky"" mark. The claims concerning ""Get Lucky"" were the claim about the settlement agreement which had -- which was supposed to prevent Lucky from continuing to use ""Get Lucky"" and trademark infringement.
As to those claims, they were resolved interlocutorily by the court -- the district court sanctions order. That order granted partial summary judgment on each of Marcel's claims insofar as Lucky was using the designation ""Get Lucky"" in direct violation of the settlement agreement and Marcel's trademark rights. The trial in the case took place more than a year after that.
And the focus of the trial was then whether the ""Get Lucky"" marks and the ""Lucky Brand"" -- the ""Lucky Brand"" marks and the ""Get Lucky"" marks were confusingly similar. That was the only issue as to liability that was left in the case after the district court entered partial summary judgment. And I would say at the same time that the Court entered partial summary judgment, it entered the permanent injunction on the use of ""Get Lucky."" The permanent injunction concerned only the use of ""Get Lucky,"" which is why, Justice Gorsuch, we could not have brought this as a judgment enforcement action. Couldn't have brought it, but I don't -- I don't understand what our -- we're supposed to decide.
I thought that we took this case because, assuming that the law is what it seems to have always been, that, where A sues B, and the suit's over, then A sues B again for identical conduct which took place after the suit was over. I thought in 1961, in Al Sacks' procedure class -- and things may have changed -- (Laughter.) -- that I learned the second suit is a new suit and therefore people can raise claims, that they are not collaterally estopped on. And that -- Because that -- isn't that right? -- issue preclusion. Is that right? What? I mean, I thought Justice Ginsburg said exactly that.
And she said that and it took her about a minute and it took Al Sacks, I think, about an hour, because -- (Laughter.) But -- but there we are.
And you started by saying that, so I thought well, I agree with that.
But I thought -- I thought that the case was about the Second Circuit trying to have a new rule that even if the facts are just -- even if the law is just what I said it was and just what she said it was, sometimes a defense is precluded when it wasn't raised before, if, A, same parties, same -- adjudicated before, it could have been asserted before, and the district court concludes that preclusion is appropriate because efficiency concerns outweigh any unfairness to the party. So I thought we were here to decide whether that was the law, and I thought that they are the only ones to have ever said that and I don't know where they got it from and I couldn't -- my law clerk couldn't find any case that ever said that.
And he couldn't find that the -- the -- that the restatement ever said that. So where have I been wrong? I mean, I mean, I guess it could become the law, but -- but I haven't heard anyone argue that it should be.
I haven't heard anyone defending the Second Circuit.
I haven't read anyone who defended the Second Circuit.
Okay, you get my point. Yes.
And -- and -- and, Your Honor -- (Laughter.) -- the -- I guess what I would say is I think the Second Circuit's test is exactly right in every particular except that -- I'm sure you do.
But -- (Laughter.) -- except that it could have been more clear, I think that the first case and second case have to involve the same -- a common nucleus of operative fact such that the claims raised in the second -- I am not interested so much in that as I am in where did that come from? Are you the first person to have made that up, and you convinced the Second Circuit, or are there others who have -- in the history of the law have said it and -- which would help me? Your Honor, we -- we recite them at length in our brief.
The idea that -- that claim preclusion has a mirror image that applies to preclude -- Oh, yes, yes -- -- defendants from raising -- -- that's true. -- defenses is very well settled. That's not my point. My point is I just read you what you what they said, and that was in a case where there wasn't claim preclusion.
They're talking about cases where there isn't claim -- I thought. But -- If they're talking about cases where there is claim preclusion, I don't know what the point -- I -- I'd have to go back to the whole thing, but I thought that's what I read you was talking about cases where there isn't claim preclusion. Well, defense can -- Am I right or not? I think defense can -- preclusion could only apply in a circumstance where claim preclusion didn't because if claim preclusion applied, of course the case wouldn't -- So I am right. -- get off the ground. It applies only in a case where there is not claim preclusion. That's what -- But -- but -- -- we're talking about.
Right.
Now, then give me the authority that says in a case where there was no claim preclusion, no claim preclusion. I -- I -- I think -- I don't -- I don't have a case to point you particular to that point, but I -- I should say that the reason that claim preclusion doesn't apply in the second case has to be not that it is a new claim, but that the claim was simply unavailable in the first -- But isn't -- - -- in the first case. Isn't there a body of law that says that the fact that the facts are different is not necessarily dispositive of this issue? So that if you have a series of lawsuits about exactly the same thing, let's say failure to pay under an installment contract or failure to pay rent and it comes up month after month, the failure to raise the defense in one of those prior actions can bar the raising of a defense in the later actions.
So -- That is precisely right. -- the fact that it's a different period of time is not necessarily dispositive if -- unless we reject that body of law. That's right, Your Honor.
And the reason is straightforward.
In the first suit, where the -- where the landlord sues the tenant on the meaning and -- and enforceability of the contract and it results in a final judgment that settles the landlord's right -- landlord's rights under that contract, the landlord ought to be entitled to rely on that contract -- All I would want -- -- on that judgment. -- is a couple of cases that I should read -- I don't read every case in the brief.
Don't tell anyone I said that. (Laughter.) But the -- the -- the -- what cases should I read to say that -- I -- Where you bring an identical -- Right.
So I would start with City of Beloit.
This is a case from 1968.
It predates the Davis case, on which my friend on the other side relies, and it -- it stands for exactly this proposition.
It does so in the context of a series of negotiable instruments, but there was an initial suit that settled the parties' rights on when later negotiable instruments came due, the plaintiffs sued again, the defendant raised a new defense, and this Court said in City of Beloit that that defense was precluded. But that was because it was all from the same issue. That -- Meaning that a -- but we have a contrary case that says when it was two different issues, then you don't have it. Not issues, Your Honor. I think causes of action.
And I think that's exact -- No, no, no.
Now you're trying to confuse things.
Beloit involved bonds that were -- that came from the same issuing body at the same time. That was Davis as well, Your Honor.
Davis and -- and Beloit -- Davis -- but it was different bonds, not from the same issue. It was the same bonds from the same issue, Your Honor. But, we got two different outcomes, then. And -- and for reasons unclear to me, the Court said in Davis when you're suing on two different negotiable instruments, you're suing on two different causes of action.
The City -- the Court in Beloit, in City of Beloit, said, well, when you're suing on two different -- All right. -- negotiable instruments -- So let me take it to this case.
You sued in 2005 for their use of ""Get Lucky"" with ""Lucky Brands."" In 2011, you're suing simply for using ""Lucky Brands."" To the extent that the case turned in 2005 in the combined confusion of the use of ""Get Lucky with ""Lucky Brands"" -- Um-hum. -- because I read your complaint and it's always in the conjunctive, both of them together, but now it's, in my mind, a different cause of action because you're saying it's the use of ""Lucky Brands"" without -- Right. -- ""Get Lucky."" So this -- this is the completion of my answer to Justice Kagan's original question, and it's this: To understand what was at issue in the first case, I think you're right, Your Honor, you have to look at the complaints.
And, in particular, what I would do is look at the -- the counts of the complaints that were reduced to judgment. So I'd point the Court to paragraph 2 on JA 206.
This is where -- this is reading the final judgment.
That paragraph reads: ""Ally's,"" -- oh, and let me pause and first say, of course, there was Lucky's complaint and Marcel's counter-complaints.
There were two complaints.
To understand what the suit was about, what the nucleus of relevant facts there was, you have to look at both. As to Lucky's claims against Marcel, the jury found as follows, and this is reduced to the final judgment.
It says: ""Ally's use of GET LUCKY as licensed from Marcel Fashion constitutes willful infringement of Lucky Brand Parties' trademarks,"" pursuant to Lucky Brand's first, second, and sixth claims."" This is the jury saying we agree with Lucky that the marks are confusingly similar. The second half of that paragraph then explains that Marcel is not liable because its mark is the senior mark. So now what did Lucky allege in its first, second, and sixth claims? And it's crystal clear.
This is docket 77-2 in the district court docket in this case. The focus of all of these claims was a confusing similarity between the two marks.
And so I'll just read as one example the sixth claim for relief.
This is paragraph 99 of Lucky's operative complaint.
It says that, ""Marcel and its licensees' use of marks confusingly similar to the Lucky family of marks has caused and continues to cause confusion as to the source of Marcel's and its licensees' products; in turn, permitting them to pass off their products to the general public as those originating"" -- So why did you end up both with a preliminary injunction and a permanent final injunction that only enjoined them from using ""Get Lucky""? We -- I know you -- there is certainly loose language in the final judgment making it unclear what it was aimed at. Right. Except for the permanent injunction.
It seems almost natural to me that if the intent was to challenge and if the district court understood you to be challenging the Lucky Brand -- Right. -- trademarks, that it would have enjoined the use of all of them. And -- and the answer is that the permanent -- the only permanent injunction in this case was the permanent injunction that was entered into interlocutorily, one year before the trial in this case.
It was the injunction entered as a sanction because Lucky had misrepresented to the court in Marcel that it was no longer using ""Get Lucky."" But I don't see the language in the final judgment.
The only thing you ended up with is an injunction against the use of Get Lucky. And we are not here enforcing the injunction.
I want to be very clear about that.
We are here enforcing -- And -- -- the -- -- just to be clear about that, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you -- you're not enforcing the injunction and you're not seeking to enforce the final judgment in the first suit either? In -- only in the sense that one would seek to enforce a declaratory judgment are we doing so.
We are -- we are seeking to enforce the rights and interests that were settled by the -- This is not a judgment enforcement action, counsel, is it? I -- I would not call it a judgment enforcement action -- Okay.
All right. -- in the sense that a claim is reduced to judgment and they're not paying on the judgment.
That's right. But as Justice Alito was explaining, the restatement -- restatement recognizes that really there are two categories of subsequent cases.
There can be subsequent cases where the parties are seeking to actually enforce the judgment and one where they are simply seeking to seek further enforcement of the rights and interests settled by and underlying the final judgment in the prior case. Well, how -- how does this undermine the prior judgment? The prior -- it -- it undermines the rights and interests settled by the final -- the final judgment from the 2005 action. What were those -- what was that -- what was those rights? The -- Was it a right for the -- right to have them not use any brand that contains -- what right was established? It was the 12 marks. It was the parties' relationship to one another with respect to the 12 Lucky Brand marks and the one Marcel Fashions' mark that were at issue in the case.
And the jury's determination that Lucky's use of those marks -- that those marks were confusingly similar to Marcel's mark and, therefore, that Lucky's use of those marks was infringement on a reverse confusion theory of liability. Each and every one of them? Of the 12 marks, yes. Each and every one of the 12.
Then -- then I come back to this question that I asked opposing counsel.
Why -- how can you account for the discrepancy between that understanding of the judgment and the injunction? Why is the injunction so much narrower than that? Well, rhe -- again, I -- the injunction was entered by the district court as a sanction.
This final judgment -- And why didn't you ask for an injunction? If you say -- Well, we -- -- that what was -- what was infringing was not simply ""Get Lucky,"" but Lucky Brand -- Um-hum. -- anything with using the word ""Lucky,"" you should have asked for an injunction. And, Your Honor, this was an issue that came up after the jury entered its verdict.
The -- the final judgment that you see is a jointly stipulated final judgment that the parties negotiated. In the course of that negotiation, counsel for Marcel suggested that we ought to enter a permanent injunction against Lucky's use of the ""Get Lucky"" marks.
It was clear that that negotiation wasn't going to result in an agreement. And Marcel then agreed to drop the issue.
But what this Court said in Lawlor is that a party's decision not to pursue a permanent injunction in the face of a judgment in its favor cannot operate as effectively a license for the party -- the -- the -- the losing defendant to continue on with what it was doing before without any risk of being -- Point me to language -- -- sued again. -- in the final judgment that says you can't -- with an -- with or without an injunction, you can't use Lucky Brand? It -- it's -- as I was saying, paragraph 2 where -- Give me a -- where are you in the Joint Appendix? JA 206.
And I will read it one more time.
It says, ""Ally's use of GET LUCKY"" -- and ally is Marcel's licensee -- ""Ally's use of GET LUCKY as licensed from Marcel Fashions, constitutes willful infringement of Lucky Brand parties,"" and then the list of the 12 marks at issue, ""pursuant to Lucky Brand parties' first, second, and sixth claims."" The first, second, and sixth claims allege, just as I read to the Court earlier, this is paragraph 74, paragraph 79, paragraph 99 of Lucky's complaint, where Lucky alleges exactly the theory of confusion that I just described that -- But -- but all that the judgment is reduced to is concerns ""GET LUCKY."" That's it. No, that's incorrect. Okay.
I mean, I'm lucking at -- okay, okay, I suppose I'm -- what am I misreading here? ""GET LUCKY"" is -- is capitalized and referenced three times in that paragraph. Which paragraph are you talking about? The one you were just reading us, counsel. Well, but that's -- that's the -- that's the explanation of why Marcel isn't liable because the ""Get Lucky"" mark, although it's confusingly similar to Marcel's marks, the ""Get Lucky"" mark is the senior mark. So the second half of that paragraph simply explains why, despite the confusing similarity between the marks -- All right. -- Marcel is not -- If you were right, why didn't you just go seek a judgment enforcement action? Why didn't you go back to the court and say this defies your judgment, Your Honor? Because a -- we -- we take this judgment in this respect to take basically the form of a declaratory judgment. One doesn't get to return to a court upon obtaining a declaratory judgment attempting to convert it into a injunction. Well, you can apply at the foot of a declaratory judgment for further relief.
Making a declaratory judgment is a nice action.
You're really going to deal with your adversary and you're going to get the declaration, but a declaratory injudgment -- judgment can be followed up. It can.
And more typically, Your Honor, it's followed up by the filing of a new lawsuit that alleges that despite the declaration of rights, the defendant has continued on with whatever it is the declaratory judgment said they didn't have a right to do.
That's -- Would you -- -- precisely what we have done. -- explain one other aspect of this to me? I thought that this settlement agreement, 2003 settlement agreement, said Marcel, you can go after Lucky.
Lucky has undertaken not to use ""Get Lucky"" anymore.
""Get Lucky"" is off the table. Right. On the other hand, Marcel is releasing Lucky of liability for using ""Lucky Brand."" Right. So ""Lucky Brand"" is Lucky's trademark and Marcel says it's not going to go after use of ""Lucky Brand."" And then we get in this post-settlement where Marcel is saying, yes, we're going to go after ""Lucky Brand,"" even though in the settlement we said we wouldn't. And -- and, Your Honor, the -- the explanation for this is twofold.
The first is Marcel became aware that Lucky was violating the terms of the settlement agreement and that it was continuing to use the ""Get Lucky"" designation. And two examples of this after the settlement agreement appear on page 8 of our red brief.
Its theory then became -- and this is where, Justice Kagan, you raised the potential factual distinctions between the cases.
They're not actually distinctions. Our theory became, one, if you're going to -- first, Lucky sued Marcel on the basis that was also released in the 2003 suit. Lucky -- Marcel then filed counterclaims and part of the theory of the counterclaims was if you're mixing the two marks together then the facts that underlie the settlement before are no longer true, and, indeed, the public may now be confused into thinking that ""Get Lucky,"" in fact, belongs to Lucky Brand.
We would make those same factual arguments in this case. Mr. -- can I -- can I go back to the law for a second? Because here's where I really think we are in this case. Second Circuit issues this decision.
And as Justice Breyer said, this decision -- we've -- you -- we've never really seen anything like this because the Second Circuit said that there was defense preclusion even in the context of new claims. You admitted that yourself, that the Second Circuit wasn't clear enough about the fact that it couldn't be a new claim.
That's because the Second Circuit never said it had to be a new claim. So the Second Circuit's ruling -- It did hold that they were -- -- excuse me -- -- were the same thing. -- goes far beyond that and applies to new claims.
So now you -- you think, well, that's got to be wrong.
So we have to limit it to old claims. So I'll just -- you know, we'll say that this is the old claim.
It's the same transaction or occurrence.
But if it were the same transaction or occurrence, you couldn't bring your second suit. Now then you say, yes, you can, because I can bring a second suit even if it is the same transaction or occurrence because I didn't have the opportunity -- Right. -- to bring it before. But nobody's ever heard of that.
The reason that you can bring a second suit is because this is a different transaction or occurrence. Your Honor, in fact, the arguments that you just described were at the heart of our arguments in the first case. And if I would, I -- I'd point the Court just to two footnotes from the court's -- the Second Circuit's decision in this case.
It's footnote 7 at appendix page -- petition appendix page 18 to 19, where the court says that this action and the prior action ""surround related transactions or occurrences."" It's saying that this is the same cause of action. Footnote 10 on page -- It said related. Related isn't the same. Your Honor, that is, in fact, a statement -- the -- the statement from restatement section 24 is connected, but I think related and connected are substantively the same.
And the court then at paragraph -- excuse me, on petition appendix 21, in footnote 10 -- may I finish -- explains why its decision in the first case -- in the first appeal and in this appeal are consistent. And it says, Your Honor, exactly what you just said, that the reason that the claims here are permitted is because they weren't available in the first suit, not because they are different claims in the sense that they arise from a different nucleus of operative fact, because they can't. The allegations here is it's a continuing course of conduct.
And the only reason they were permissible is because, that in fact, they were unavailable.
That is clear on the face of the opinion and I -- we think applying that opinion requires affirmance. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Ms. Cendali. Thank you. Two series of points, one relating to the question presented on the rule of law, the new rule of law, and one relating to the new claim argument. One of the striking things about Marcel's argument is that there was no defense of the basic principle, as Justice Breyer was saying, that -- that you can have a new -- in the case where there is a new claim, a previously unlitigated, unresolved defense can be excluded. But he says -- he points correctly to two cases.
One was the one Justice Alito mentioned, the landlord case, and the other was the Bond case and in both cases -- you understand.
You probably read those cases. Right.
And so -- And what's -- -- let's talk -- What's your answer to that? Right.
But let's -- but let's -- let's talk about that.
First, it shouldn't be forgotten at page 17 of their brief, they say that a preclusion of a defense requires that the causes of action be the same. That's basic civil procedure.
I learned that in professor Arthur Miller's class. The case that they cited then was City of Beloit.
City of Beloit, as Justice Sotomayor said, is our case, because that was a case when there was a judgment that the city had to pay, it then brought a suit in equity to try to get from out of that judgment.
That is not a case involving the facts here of a new claim. And, moreover, to the extent that there's loose remarks going in that direction in that case, that was specifically dealt with by the majority opinion in Cromwell, which surveyed all the law up to that point and, specifically, while it didn't cite City of Beloit by name, it specifically explained away Henderson v. Henderson, which was the main case City of Beloit relied on saying Henderson v. Henderson was also a collateral attack case and doesn't rely on it. Later that term in another opinion by Justice Field, Rogers v. -- excuse me, Davis v. Brown, City of Beloit, excuse me, and Cromwell was only cited by the defense, which is telling. What about the -- what about the rent? The rent? The -- the landlord sues the tenant for rent on a lease and wins. And then later on, the tenant doesn't pay again, so he -- okay, he, sues him again on the lease and this time the defendant wants to say the lease is invalid and the court said no, you can't, because you should have said that before. Because to the extent that that case is -- is a new claim, they should be able to bring that.
There's an ongoing course of -- of conduct then -- then -- and you were made whole from the first nonpayment -- So that isn't the question, because everybody agrees it's a new course of conduct.
But this was a defense.
And they said you can't raise the defense.
And then Wright and Miller is a little worried about that.
They say, well, this is a question about estoppel.
And -- so -- so that seemed like a point on his side.
What about those cases? Well, it -- well, none of the cases, none of the cases cited in their brief, are on -- these facts.
With regard to the rent case, if it's -- if it means what was just said, then it's just wrong and not consistent with law.
And -- Counsel, let's assume that they had actually litigated, you had actually litigated whether the use of ""Lucky Brand"" trademarks, without the use of ""Get Lucky,"" was an infringement on the superior ""Get Lucky"" mark.
Let's assume the Court had said it's an infringement for you to do that.
No permanent injunction.
We're just going to give damages. Then there's now a new lawsuit that says you're continuing, after the old one, to use the ""Lucky Brand"" trademarks in the same way.
That's how they are pitching this to us, okay? Now you should be precluded because you had a full and fair opportunity to raise the settlement agreement as your right to use the ""Lucky Brands."" You didn't.
Why should you raise it now? That -- I think that that's the case that they say this is. Right. And assuming that were the case, you had a full and fair opportunity to litigate your use of ""Lucky Brands"" without ""Get Lucky,"" and the jury found that your use was an infringement, how could you then defend this case? May I answer? Yes. Well, you would defend it because the case sought subsequent relief for subsequent infringements where you would be allowed to present new defenses to that different period of time.
In the absence of a forward-looking injunction, it's a -- a new case.
Future facts could not have been before the court.
And that's the answer. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1023, Maine Community Health Options versus United States, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a massive government bait-and-switch and the fundamental question of whether the government has to keep its word after its money-mandating promises have induced reliance. The government suggests that there is no such thing as an enforceable congressional promise and that even the clearest command to pay money is subject to a caveat that it's subject to appropriations, and reliance, even on clear language, is ""inherently unreasonable."" That position is inconsistent with all this Court's cases, including the ones that go the government's way by finding an implied repeal for, in the government's view, there is nothing to repeal.
Simply failing to appropriate the money cancels the obligation. The government's position would also make it impossible to accomplish many important government objectives that require a clear and enforceable promise to pay, as this case well illustrates. When Congress made the health benefit exchanges a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, it faced a problem.
The exchanges depended on the participant of private health insurance companies, and those companies were being asked to insure previously uninsured people on unprecedented terms. The natural reaction of the insurers would have been to charge a substantial premium to account for the uncertainties, but that premium would have worked against the government in two fundamental ways.
First, it would have made the policies relatively unaffordable, contrary to the whole purpose of the Affordable Care Act; and, second, the government would have ended up paying for those heightened premiums through tax subsidies. So the risk corridor programs at issue here was an important component of the government's solution to the problem.
The program depended on a clear and enforceable promise that the government would pay for a portion of any losses incurred by the health insurance companies that stepped forward. In order for that promise to work, it had to be clear and enforceable.
If the government had simply said we will make these risk corridor payments subject to appropriations, the promise would have made no difference whatsoever. If all the insurance companies were doing was trading the uncertainties about the risk pool for the uncertainties over the funding priorities of future Congresses, they would have gained nothing in the process.
So Congress made a clear money-mandating promise to pay. Based on that promise, my clients and others got state-approved rates to offer policies on the exchanges.
After those rates were already set, then HHS adopted its so-called transitional policy, which kept some healthy people off the exchanges and, as the government itself recognized, meant that more insurers would lose more money.
But HHS said to the insurers: Don't worry, we have the risk corridors program in place, and we will cover some of those excess losses as a result of the transitional policy. So the policies went forward and losses were incurred, and when it became time to pay, the government then started pointing to some ambiguous appropriations riders. But those riders by their plain terms did not repeal the obligations of 1342 or even say prospectively that we're going to limit the payments out to the extent of payments in. What if they had been included in the original legislation? If the appropriations riders had been included in the original legislation, would that make a difference? Well, ultimately, I don't think it would make a difference in the sense that I think it's a little hard to -- to figure out exactly what that would look like. And I think the reason you didn't have appropriation riders in the 2010 legislation is because, for this part of the policy, the policies wouldn't be offered until 2014 and you really wouldn't be in a position to know whether or not there was an obligation until 2015. But what if the law said the government shall pay and the money shall come from the premiums, but it may not come from the only other identified source that could be used to pay? So, Justice Alito, I think if they tried to do that ex ante in 2014, that I think people would say -- that would be sufficiently strange that I think people would say, well, what exactly do you mean by that? And I think there probably would have been a clarification before anybody relied. But, of course, back in 2010, there was none of that kind of language whatsoever, and you had what, I think, anybody would recognize as a clear money-mandating promise that the government shall pay certain obligations.
And the -- Mr. Clement, you are relying on what you call an implied damages action based on 1342, but this Court has been reluctant to imply any right of action, has insisted on Congress providing the right of action.
And, here, the right of action -- your -- your -- your complaint is not based on any right of action provided by Congress. Well, ultimately, we think it is, Justice Ginsburg, but it has to be inferred from the money-mandating promise itself.
And I think it's telling that there was nobody on this Court who was a greater skeptic of implied cause of actions than Justice Scalia, but, in his opinion in Bowen against Massachusetts, he recognized it had been long established that this kind of ""shall pay"" language gave rise not just to jurisdiction under the Tucker Act but to a cause of action for damages. I think the reason that even Justice Scalia, no fan of the implied cause of action, was able to recognize that is because, if you think about the kind of obligations that are at issue in the jurisdiction over the Tucker Act, they are all clear obligations to pay, and whether it's the Takings Clause, whether it's a contract, whether it's a money-mandating statute.
In each case, there's a clear obligation to pay specific amounts to specific people. And in that situation, I don't think that you need to have a separate cause of action.
I mean, you think about a contract. You generally don't have in the contract a cause of action to bring a breach of contract action. It's implicit that if the government or any other counterparty doesn't uphold their end of the bargain, there is a cause of action for damages. Well, what is the -- Are there any -- -- what is the difference between a statutory provision that says a person shall have some non-monetary right and a statutory provision that says a -- an entity, a company, shall be paid? Why should we be more willing to infer a cause of action in the latter situation than in the -- in the former? Well, I -- I think -- Because of special solicitude for insurance companies? Well, no, obviously not, Justice Alito, but I think, first of all, if you have the sort of ""shall do"" something other than pay money, you don't have to look for an implied cause of action because I think you would have a cause of action that would arise under the APA to enforce the particular whatever it was, ""shall"" fill in the blank.
The action you can enforce under the APA.
If the action is -- No, no, a damages remedy for that. Well, I don't know that you would necessarily infer a damages remedy for that, but I think you would get very much the same thing under the APA.
And I think as -- you know, as the majority held in Bowen against Massachusetts, sometimes you can get relief under the APA that's not strictly limited to injunctive relief but includes other kinds of monetary relief but not damages. In all events, we're not asking you to break any new ground here.
And I think compared to cases of this Court, like White Mountain Apache and the Mitchell case from 1983, it's sometimes called Mitchell II, this case is a very straightforward case of saying that a money-mandating statute is enforceable in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act. Are there any limits to that, Mr. Clement? Is the ""shall pay"" language sufficient in all cases no matter what the kind of program or entitlement or grant? Is -- is it just ""shall pay"" does it? Well, I -- I think, Justice Kagan, if you look at the Federal Circuit's precedents on this, ""shall pay"" alone might not do it, but when you combine that with specific -- specificity about what amounts are going to be paid and to whom and under what circumstances, that's clearly sufficient for a money-mandating promise and it always has been. And, again, I think, if you think about this case in comparison to this Court's precedents involving Indian trust obligations, this is a much more specific and much more enforceable promise.
This is not a direction to the Secretary of Interior to take certain property in trust.
This is a direction that you shall pay certain amounts. And I think one thing that makes this a very easy case, if you're concerned about sort of opening up the -- the sort of money-mandating statute too wide is that you have the exact same language here in the parallel provision, ""shall pay,"" and nobody thinks, not even the government thinks, that the ""shall pay"" direction to those insurance companies that made profits on the exchanges is anything but an enforceable promise. You make a case at some length about the reliance of the insurance companies, they were basically seduced into this program, but they have good lawyers and the Constitution says no money shall come out of the Treasury except pursuant to an appropriations clause, and I would have thought at some point they would have sat down and said, well, why don't we insist upon an appropriations provision before we put ourselves on the hook for $12 billion? Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think they -- they did have very good lawyers and they looked at this Court's precedents, they looked at the precedents of the Federal Circuit, and although those court cases all stand for the proposition that, obviously, Congress has the power of the purse, with all respect, they don't stand for the proposition that the only way that Congress can open the purse is by making a specific appropriation. It has long been the law recognized by this Court and by the government in its GAO red book, which is sort of the bible for these kind of things, that the government can obligate itself and Congress can obligate itself without using any magic words of appropriation.
And the governing standard is, if a statute is money-mandating, then that obligates the government. And the reason that's not a problem under the Antideficiency Act or the appropriations clause is that's Congress itself opening up the purse for specific amounts for specific purposes. No, I know. But I think the reliance argument has to be taken at least subject to the qualification. Yeah, I understand your argument, but, if somebody raised their hand and said, hey, shouldn't we get an appropriations provision here, nobody would have said, well, you know, we don't need it because this is a money-mandating statute and this and this and this, and, you know, if something goes wrong, we can get Mr. Clement to go argue the case. (Laughter.) It -- it strikes me that you do have the appropriations clause sitting out there and it's a pretty clear yellow light. Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it's as clear as you think, because, look, the government's position is what we needed to do was include language in 2010 that said that this constitutes budget authority. But, of course, that would be subject to a subsequent Congress's amendment as well. So, for purposes of the retroactivity argument, I think what's important here is, in 2010, they made a money-mandating promise that I think anyone who looked at all the sources would say, that's good enough. Now could it be better? Could it have belt and suspenders? Sure, but it's good enough.
And then they relied on that, they provided the service.
The government had no problem saying, based on the same ""shall pay"" language in 1342, we need you insurance companies that made money in 2014 to make your payments in. And at that point in 2000 -- late 2014, after the insurance companies had -- had upheld their end of the bargain, they simply imposed some appropriations riders that said, we're not going to use -- by their terms, we're not going to use this one fund to make these payments. And they didn't use language that this Court has looked to in other cases, like ""from this fund or any other"" or ""this act or any other."" They didn't do what they could have done, which is they could have prospectively repealed 1342 or they could have prospectively limited the amount of payments out to payments in. Was there some other fund that could have been used? I -- I -- I don't think that anybody readily identified another fund that would have been used by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make the payments. But it's Black Letter Law that that doesn't make the obligation go away.
All that -- But wasn't this the only fund that was identified by the GAO as a potential source? Well, GAO, in its correspondence with two members of Congress, identified two sources of funds for the appropriations.
These funds were one of them, and then the other one was that the payments in could be construed as user fees.
Interestingly, GAO said, what -- what were the user fees, what were they paying for? They were paying for the guarantee that the government would pay for their losses. So even GAO's analysis of why it was that the payments in could be construed as user fees depends on the notion that these were real enforceable promises. But -- So -- -- you've now had an opportunity to study this in detail.
Can you identify any source, other than the Judgment Fund, that could be used to pay these billions of dollars? I can't, Justice Alito. And that's a problem for why the Secretary of Health and Human Services can't voluntarily make the payments without violating the Antideficiency Act. But what happens in that situation -- and this Court made this absolutely clear in the Ramah decision -- is when there is insufficient funds for an executive branch officer to make a payment under which the United States is obligated, then they can't make the payment voluntarily.
They can't cut the check.
But what happens then is that there's a suit in the Court of Claims.
The fact that the government can't cut the check to pay its obligation means there's either a breach of contract or a violation of the statute. Then there's a judgment, and then you can collect under the Judgment Fund.
But the fact that the government decides that, you know, we have these obligations, but we just don't feel like appropriating enough money for them just doesn't cancel the obligation or make it go away. And as I said, that's really been Black Letter Law for 100 years in the Court of Claims.
This -- But do you think it would be reasonable for the insurance companies to say: Look, we know that Congress is now refusing to appropriate any money to pay us, but don't worry, we'll sue later and we'll get the money, billions of dollars, from the Judgment Fund? Justice Alito, at the time that they're first being told that the government's not going to pay in 2014, late 2014, it's already too late for 2014.
They've already performed.
And so, as to that, there's a real retroactivity problem. Now I think, if Congress at that point had said, as they did in other proposed legislation that didn't have the votes, if they had said prospectively we're no longer going to make payments under 1342 or we're going to limit the amount of payments out to payments in, at that point, absolutely, an insurance company would prudently change its course of conduct. But, if an insurance company is watching Congress and what it sees is there are express efforts to repeal this provision expressly going forward and they fail, and all there is is an effort by some people to essentially hobble the Secretary of Health and Human Services in her ability to discharge what have to be understood as obligations of the United States, then, under those circumstances, the right result is to file a suit and get your judgment and get your claim from the Judgment Fund. But it is not the law that the government can simply make its obligations go away by deciding that, after the fact, after the obligations have been incurred, after the counterparty has been -- has performed, we're just not going to appropriate the money. The government -- Why isn't this a contract? I think it very much operates like a contract, Justice Breyer. Yeah, but why isn't it one? Well, we -- we're saying it is.
And -- and I think the -- the -- I think -- Is there some authority that says this isn't a contract? No, I don't, Justice Breyer.
I -- I -- look, I actually think the best two paragraphs on this issue is what Justice Scalia said in his Bowen opinion, because what he said is you could understand this kind of statutory offer either as a unilateral offer to contract that's accepted through performance or you could understand it as a statutory obligation. And he said, consistent with the position of the federal government in the Bowen brief, which is worth a -- worth a read if you get a chance, but he said consistent with their position, the better way to think about it is that it's a statute and it's a statutory -- Mister -- -- obligation that can be enforced. -- Mr. Clement, the problem was that Justice Scalia was in dissent.
So how do we -- how do we salvage his observations when it didn't win the day in that case? Well, it's easy to, Justice Sotomayor, because the majority did not actually disagree with him on this point.
What the majority held was that the exclusion in the APA was not necessarily coextensive with the Tucker Act jurisdiction. So it thought the claims there could be brought under the APA.
But it even said in Footnote 48 that even if some of the claims could be brought under the Tucker Act, that would be fine, you could bring those claims in the -- in the Court of Claims, but it wouldn't mean that there was a bar on APA jurisdiction. So I think -- So give me a one- or two-sentence distinguishing of that case from this one.
Why is this one mandate -- mandating Tucker Act payment and that one wasn't? Because they both had the ""shall pay"" language. Yes.
So, Justice Sotomayor, I -- Or both statutes had the ""shall"" -- Right.
So I want to repeat my point that I don't think anything in the majority or the dissenting opinion there said that that wasn't money-mandating language that could have been brought in the Court of Claims for at least retrospective relief.
I'm quite confident of that. But there's also a distinction, which is what the Court relied on there was the ongoing relationship between the states and the federal government there and the fact that the way that the program worked there, what -- what the state was actually suing for is not having to -- was in order to not have to reimburse some funds. I think, if you actually think about that opinion and read the key footnotes, which are 31, 38, 42, and 48 -- I think I have that right -- if you look at that, I don't think there's any indication that if what was at issue there is something like this, which is an entirely retrospective set of obligations for a program that essentially sunsetted in 2016, I don't think there's any indication that the Court would have thought that should be brought as an APA action and not as a Tucker Act claim. And, of course, keep in mind the government's position is not that we sued in the wrong court.
The government's position is that there's just not sufficient money-mandating language in the statute. And I think that's a very difficult proposition to sustain if you take seriously not just 100 years of Court of Claims and Federal Circuit cases but also compare it to White Mountain Apache, compare it to -- compare it to the Mitchell case from 1983.
This is much more obviously money-mandating language. And, again, it was in a brief and it was in a brief where they persuaded Justice Scalia but not every member of the Court, but the government in its Bowen brief essentially said that they couldn't imagine clearer money-mandating language than the ""shall pay"" language in that statute.
And, here, it's even clearer, it's all retrospective, and it's a ""shall pay"" obligation to specified individuals for specified sums under specified circumstance. And then one other distinction -- I'm like more than two sentences at this point, but one other distinction is unlike another stat -- any other statute I've seen, you have the parallel language in what was expected of the counterparty, the same ""shall pay"" language. And even the government says that, of course, that was just an absolutely mandatory obligation. If you put this all together, what the government's position is, it's really extraordinary, because they -- their position is there never was any binding obligation at all. They didn't even have to appropriate the payments in.
That just happened -- later Congresses did that through the user fee appropriation. So their view is that a promise that was concededly designed to give comfort to the insurance companies that they would have some coverage against losses actually provided no coverage against losses but absolutely mandated the payments in no matter what. And -- and I do want to emphasize that no matter, like, how you look at their position, it is completely inconsistent with all of this Court's cases, even the ones that go in their favor.
And one way to look at that is, under their view, there was nothing to repeal.
But the other way to look at that is, if you look at cases like Langston, like Dickerson, like Will, in the original statute that provided for a salary or provided for a payment, none of those original statutes had language that talked specifically about budget authority. So, under their view, those cases were really easy cases and this Court completely missed the ball and mis-analyzed those cases. Is it possible to think of those cases as -- as -- as cases we shouldn't rely on to the extent we usually do because -- because of the Judgment Fund? In other words, we live in a different world now? No, absolutely not, Justice Kagan, because what happened in those cases is even before the Judgment Fund, there were judgments.
And there was a judgment in that case for, I think, $7,666 against the federal government. Now, under their theory of the case, there should have been no judgment.
That judgment should have been affirmed.
And back then, of course, once you got the judgment, you went to Congress and tried to get Congress to pay it.
But -- and -- and -- and -- and, of course, Congress generally almost always paid it, so you never had to answer the $64,000 question of whether there was a taking if they just refused to pay it. I think another reason to decide this case in our favor is, if you adopted the government's position, you'd have to overcome not just the presumption against implied repeals but also the presumption against retroactivity. And none of the cases that the government can point to ever held the private party essentially was on the hook and the government didn't have to pay once the obligation was already incurred. The cases like Dickerson and Will, they were talking about prospective obligations for the next year.
When this Court has confronted cases where the government was saying that it didn't have to pay for past obligations, cases like the Twenty Per Cent Cases and the Larionoff case that are cited in the reply brief of Land of Lincoln, the government never won those cases. And the reason there's a big difference is when the government says we're not going to pay, and they're talking about only a prospective obligation, maybe it's fair to infer that they want that prospective obligation to go away.
But, if they're to say we don't want to pay for something that's an obligation they already incurred, then they're actually risking, I think, a very serious takings violation. Again, Justice Breyer for the Court noted that there was a potential constitutional problem with retroactive legislation of this type in the Cherokee Nation case.
So it's always been recognized that there's a big difference in this context between retrospective obligations and prospective obligations. So there's really no precedent on the government's side of this case, and it would be a terrible precedent to start because this is not going to be the only context where it's very important for the government and Congress to be able to make enforceable promises to pay. Has there ever been a case where this Court has, in effect, required Congress to appropriate, through the Judgment Fund or in any other way, billions of dollars for private businesses? Well, look, I -- I don't -- I mean, if -- it's a contract case, but, if you cut right down to it and you adjust for inflation, I would think Winstar got you into the billions of dollars as well. And I think Winstar is another good example, although it was conceived of as a contracting case.
The government came in after the fact and tried to tell this Court that its original promises to make good on the goodwill were just illusory, and they just -- you know, they just didn't bind future Congresses.
And this Court didn't buy the argument then.
It shouldn't buy the argument now. I totally get the point that Congress has the power of the purse, but Congress is not disabled from making an enforceable promise to open the purse in the future on specified terms. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the Chief Justice has said, the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution is central to this case.
This Court has described it as a straightforward and explicit command in OPM versus Richmond.
That command is a central feature of the separation of powers under the Constitution, and it's reinforced by the requirement that appropriations bills originate in the House of Representatives, which was designed to ensure that the representatives of the people would have and would jealously guard the power of the purse.
And that system -- constitutional framework is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act. That is all part of the framework under which 1342 operates.
1342 did not make an appropriation; therefore, the Secretary could not make a payment.
Any payment was contingent upon a future appropriation. As soon as Congress passed the first appropriations act after this, it passed an appropriation, not a rider, which is usually something tangential.
It is the very appropriations act.
And the only thing they appropriated was payments in, the user fees. They prohibited, as Justice Alito pointed out, the only other possible source of funds. The -- the Secretary's compliance with that constitutional and statutory framework does not constitute a violation for which a cause of action can be inferred under the Tucker Act. Despite all of that, Petitioners do rely on 1342 in the absence of an appropriation as an obligation to pay.
And that would impose unprecedented liability on the United States of billions of dollars.
Nothing in Section 1342 requires that extraordinary result. It's particularly telling that 1342, Congress said, it should be based upon the Part D risk corridors provision.
The Part D risk corridors provision contains express language that -- it states an obligation of the Secretary to pay for Medicare Part D drugs, and it represents budget authority.
None of that is in 1342 -- You can explain it -- -- which is patterned after it. -- in simple terms. Day one of contracts.
Jack Dawson.
I say to you: My hat's on the flagpole.
If you bring it down, I'll pay you $10.
You bring it down.
I owe you $10. Now how does this differ? It didn't -- And if it -- if it didn't differ.
So why does the government not have to pay its contracts, just like anybody else? And that's -- is there some language? I guess they could pass a statute and say we won't pay our contract.
Okay? Then you have to follow the statute, until -- unless the Court sets it aside.
They didn't say that. They didn't say they didn't -- you know, you've read the argument.
They didn't say they wouldn't pay.
They just said: Don't pay it out of this fund.
That's common.
What it means is don't pay it out of this fund.
End of the case. If you have some other fund, pay it out of that.
It doesn't say don't pay it out of that.
So that's very simple-minded, what I've just said, but what's the answer to it? The -- the answer is that this is not a contract. Why not? This -- this Court -- Well, I mean, it's pretty close.
But why -- why -- why isn't it close? I think it's -- Why isn't it either a contract or close enough? It says ""shall pay."" If you climb the pole, we'll pay.
They climbed the pole.
Pay. It's very far from a contract.
And I think the starting premise is what -- what this Court has repeatedly said and reiterated in the National -- the Amtrak case, the National Railroad Passenger case, which is statutes are generally, absent a clear statement, construed not to establish a contract, not to establish private contractual rights or vested rights because a statute states a policy of the legislature until the legislature changes that policy. There is nothing in this statute that -- that creates an express contract.
There's -- So is -- -- the language -- -- is every congressional promise to pay, therefore, subject to an implicit subject to appropriations caveat? I -- I believe by and large that that is correct, yes. How did we decide Winstar? I -- I remember staying here until July and somebody over the government had promised all those banks that if they did dah, dah, dah, they'd get paid about a billion dollars. And those were -- And they did do dah, dah, dah. And those were -- those promises were based on contracts.
A contract is very different from a statute.
This is a general statute providing -- it's one of many subsidies under the Affordable Care Act for people who participate in a private market. They -- the insurers were not performing services for the government.
They weren't working for the government.
They weren't furnishing goods to the government. They were participating in a market -- All the -- -- economy. -- all the statutes that say, I don't know, but it seems to me there must be a lot and I haven't looked it up.
I have seen a lot of cases they cited, but all the statutes that say, if you do X, the government shall pay you, Mr. Veteran, Mr. Paratrooper, Mr., you know, you name it, they don't really mean it.
Is that -- is that what it is? No, it -- It's not a contract? I mean -- No, it is -- -- I don't know how this works. -- it is -- it is definitely not a contract.
Someone who works for the government does not work by contract. Government -- government people are appointed. And I think it's important, the Langston case and that line of cases had been mentioned here.
First of all, Langston is the only case in which this Court found liability. And seven years later, in the Belknap case, the Court said that's as far as we're going to go. And in -- in Langston, what was critical is the Court found the appropriations language ambiguous.
They -- Congress had appropriated, had paid the amount that was called for in the -- in the salary statute before, and the Court couldn't believe that Congress really meant to cut back -- that back. Here, there's no question, the Appropriations Act is unambiguous.
It specifically refers to 1342 -- But it didn't -- -- and tells you what money can be -- can be paid. -- it didn't -- it didn't repeal the ""shall pay."" In fact, there were bills to repeal, and there weren't sufficient votes in Congress to repeal.
So whatever they did, it didn't repeal the obligation, the risk corridors obligation.
It stayed there.
And an appropriation is -- is a temporary -- a temporary legislation.
It controls the appropriations in a particular fiscal year, but then isn't the -- the fact that they didn't have the votes, they couldn't repeal this measure, significant? No, I -- I -- I don't think there's any indication they didn't have the votes.
All the bills that were cited here were simply bills that were introduced.
The idea that Congress rejected them just because they were introduced is -- is not correct. There were two types of bills, one -- one of which was to repeal it outright. Congress -- nobody says the appropriations law here repealed it.
The other was to make payments in match payments out so that it would be budget neutral.
That's exactly what the appropriations statute did. I -- I -- I vaguely recall the government arguing on several occasions that unenacted bills are entitled to some weight in the interpretation process, but you don't question that these insurance companies would not have participated in the risk corridor program but for the government's promise to pay? I -- I don't -- well, it's not about participating in the risk corridor program.
The question is they participated in the -- in the marketplaces that were set up, the exchanges, and they had a number of business incentives.
This was a vast new market for customers, many of whom, 90 percent of -- Well -- -- whom would get -- would get tax subsidies. -- customers who otherwise were largely uninsurable. Yes.
But they -- but it was a mark -- Well, that's no great business opportunity for them. Oh -- oh, no, it -- it is, because Congress provided tax credits to subsidize the -- the -- the persons who -- who purchased insurance on the exchanges. No, it's a good business opportunity for them because the government promised to pay. Well, it's a good -- it's a good opportunity for the insurance companies.
There were -- there were a number of incentives here.
This is -- there were two other risk mitigating provisions in the Act. There were -- Are you saying -- -- a number of things working together -- -- that the insurance companies would have done the same thing with or without this promise to pay? I -- I don't think we know what they -- I think -- I -- I -- I don't think that they would have declined to participate.
They may have charged greater premiums, but that's different from not participating. Okay.
Are -- but that's -- that's a materially different thing. Well, it -- I mean, the government -- the Congress that passed this provision wanted to keep the premiums down, didn't it? And so it induced a certain kind of reliance -- Well, it -- it -- it -- -- on the part of the insurers. -- it wanted -- it wanted to encourage -- I think the primary point was to encourage the insurers to go on the -- on the marketplace.
And as I say, they had a bunch -- there were a number of subsidies both to the individuals through the tax credits and the insurance companies through the risk mitigation provisions, but -- and Congress provided in the private sector. Again, the insurance companies were not performing services for the government. They were taking advantage of an opportunity in the private sector that Congress had -- that Congress had established with a bunch of subsidies.
This is just -- this is just one of them. They were induced to -- to charge lower premiums by the ""shall pay"" language? I -- I think we can assume that that -- that that contributed to it, but it was a -- it was a subsidy.
And there's something I want to say when we were talking about the Langston case that -- that very much differs from this context. Langston and that entire line of cases were cases about, as I think I mentioned, employment, salary.
There was -- in -- in a salary situation, while -- while it's not a contract, there is an exchange of services for money.
And I -- That's exactly my -- my question.
You seem to have two separate arguments.
One depends on the -- on the appropriations -- on the appropriations measure. Suppose there were none.
Your first -- No appropriations? No, there had never been any appropriations language.
That didn't exist.
I think you want to argue, even so, the government wouldn't have had to pay? That's correct. All right.
Now, on that, I don't think you're saying, look through the statute books.
Every time the statute says to any private citizen, if you do X, we shall pay you, okay, that's the form, and it may exist all over the place, and you're saying at least sometimes they don't have to do it, or maybe you're saying they never have to do it. Well -- Which are you saying? -- well, you would have to look at the particular statute. No, no, no, that's what I wanted.
Then you're saying sometimes -- No, I -- I think -- -- or -- -- I think -- I think almost never, but -- but -- Almost never -- -- but -- but if -- -- okay.
What is the line that distinguishes those instances where the government says, we shall pay you, Mr. Private Citizen, if you do X.
He does X, but the government does not have to pay him. What is the line? Okay.
It's -- when -- when Congress wants to undertake that sort of obligation, it does it through contracts.
It does it by authorizing an agency to enter into contracts, which then forms a bilateral promise and performance -- Why? -- back to -- back to the government. That's what I want to know.
You're saying if there isn't a contract, never.
Very well.
What is the case that supports that line, that says, unless, government, you delegate to a private -- you delegate to an official the power to enter into a contract with the private citizen, unless you do that, even though you said ""shall pay,"" you don't have to.
Okay. What is the case that says that? Well, I -- I don't have -- I don't have a case of this Court that says it, but, frankly, neither does the other side in a subsidy -- in a subsidy program like this. All of the cases -- again, I want to come back to this. All of the cases in the Langston line of cases all the way up to Will were about salaries.
And there is, I think, a sense, and it's now, for example, in the civil service code, a government employee is entitled to a salary. We all understand that.
In fact, in Langston, the back -- the background statute said that the person was entitled to the salary. There's no language like that in this -- Mister -- I guess I'm not sure why it -- it -- that makes a real difference from this case.
I mean, those cases were about a certain kind of compensation for services rendered.
And this case is about a certain kind of compensation for services rendered, isn't it? No, it's not.
It -- it -- it -- this is a -- this is a -- and this is what's different.
This is about subsidies for people participating in the market.
They are not services rendered to the government. There is no promise by the government individualized -- It was services that the government thought were needed to ensure the working of the program that it wanted -- Well -- -- to carry out. -- Congress frequently enacts subsidy programs, and, yes, it does it with the hopes that people will -- will carry out, you know, the -- the incentivized program. But that doesn't mean Congress has made -- has created a vested right in them. Again, I want to come back to the Amtrak case and -- and -- and referring back to the Dodge case as the canonical statement, and that is that an act -- that a statute, an act of Congress, absent clear indications, is not construed to create a contract and is not construed to create vested rights.
It establishes a policy which the legislature is -- Absent -- -- putting together. -- absent clear indication -- what clear indication would be required, short of a contract? Well, we had -- we have an example -- I mean, tellingly, in this case, we have an example in the Part D Medicare risk corridors provision in which Congress -- Congress in 1342, for this risk corridor program, said base this one upon that one.
That one, though, has the express advance budget authority and expressly says this represents an obligation of the Secretary to pay. But Mr. Clement -- This Court -- I'm sorry. -- Mr. Clement says that there are also many provisions that say, in essence, ""shall pay"" subject to appropriations. Well, the -- In other words, Congress knows how to prevent the obligation from being -- from taking effect before the future appropriation and, in fact, does so often and did so in the Affordable Care Act. Well, in the Affordable Care Act, I -- I think it's -- I just want to point out to the Court, they -- they cite a handful of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, and they're -- they're almost all in specialized grant programs, but it's telling, if you look at them, the ones that are immediately adjacent to them which have parallel grant provisions and don't have this language. 42 U.S.C. 480(k) has this language that 2 -- immediately preceding it, 280(j)(3) and 280(k)(1) also grant programs and don't have it.
And the same thing is true with 293(k)(2)(E), which they cite.
The one -- the two immediately preceding don't have that language.
There is no rhyme or reason in the -- in the Act for that. It's not entirely clear what the ""subject to appropriations"" language does.
We, frankly, looked to see if there's an appropriations or statutory principle.
We were unable to find one.
It -- I think it may be -- Well, I would think it's pretty clear what the ""subject to appropriations"" language does.
It puts people on notice.
It says this is not a guarantee.
It says, you know, you should take this with a grain of salt.
And when it's not there, the government says we're committed. I -- I -- I think that would be a -- a great over-reading of the -- of -- of those provisions, which I think may be present just as a matter of habit in particular committees.
They -- I think they are housekeeping within the government.
You have an authorizing committee that sets up the program but an appropriations committee that comes -- that comes along later. But I -- I don't think the presence or absence of this -- the -- the Appropriations Clause and the Antideficiency Act state this very rule, and Congress is entitled to rely upon that and not expect that -- that an inferred -- The -- -- cause of action would be inferred. -- the -- the -- I never understood the Antideficiency Act to apply to the actions of agencies.
I understood it to apply to individuals who go and obligate the government when they really had no authority to do that. I never understood it to mean, whenever the particular agency or department pays money, that they're going to be prosecuted under -- under that -- Well, the agency -- -- criminal provision, right? -- the agency wouldn't, but the -- but the criminal statute is the way in which Congress has enforced -- Okay, so the Secretary of the Treasury is going to be prosecuted criminally because of his interpretation of whether or not the funds were authorized? Well, I mean, it's a reasonable interpretation he's probably not going to be prosecuted, but -- but that is the way in which Congress has kept the power of the purse. One -- one other piece of -- But what does the Antideficiency Act have to do with Congress's own ability to commit itself? The Antideficiency -- this is a statute that speaks -- 1342, as most ""shall pay"" statutes would, speaks to an agency. But that -- but when a -- when 1342 says pay -- first of all, it says the Secretary should set up a program under which the Secretary would pay.
It's really a feature of a -- of a described program, not a direct statutory command.
But even -- even so, putting that to one side, it speaks to the Secretary.
The Antideficiency Act speaks to the Secretary.
It tells the Secretary, I know we said that you shall pay this, but -- but it's contingent upon the subsequent appropriation.
And, here, when Congress subsequently appropriated, it limited the amount of funds that were available. And in deciding whether there's an inferred cause of action, you should look at the entire statutory framework, which includes the Constitution, 1342, and the appropriations language, and the Anti- -- and the Antideficiency Act. Can I interrupt for a second? I -- I'm -- I'm thinking about your answer and it's interesting, but let's take a form of words.
If you -- I'm back in that simple thing. If you do X, we shall pay Y.
Now where we left off was, if that form of words appears in a statute, Congress doesn't have to do it.
But, if the statute says a GS-12 can use those form of words, write them down, hand them to the other side, then they have to do it. Okay? Because that's a contract.
That's where I think we were.
And there's no authority either way. All right.
If there's no good authority either way, to use a word that's not always appreciated in this Court as much as I do, what policy could that rule serve? What policy, constitutional or otherwise, would be served by a rule that says a GS-12 can make the United States pay the money, but the Congress of the United States, House and Senate, signed by the President, cannot -- I think fun -- -- or does not? Does not. I think fundamental policies. What? First on the -- first on the contract side.
A contract is a -- is a document that is bilateral.
It is signed by each party.
There are reciprocal undertakings specific to that individual.
And in that -- in that situation where you have an appropriation -- and Ramah was a contract case, not a statutory case.
And what the Court said there, when -- when you enter into a contract, you're entitled to be paid because the individual contractor who has -- who has performed services to the government and expects something in return can't be expected to keep track of the appropriations account and can't be responsible if the agency devotes funds to other purposes. A statute is fundamentally different. It is not an individual bilateral relationship in which the government says we will make a commitment to you if you do something.
And the fundamental point on the statutory side, I go back to the Amtrak, National Passenger Railroad, case, in which the Court said that a statute, absent a clear statement, is construed not to impose a contract or vested rights.
And that is in deference to Congress.
And in this context, it's tied back to the -- If we -- -- appropriations clause. -- if we were to rule for you, everyone will be on notice going forward, private parties and Congress itself, that ""shall pay"" doesn't obligate actual payments.
If we rule against you, Congress also will be on notice going forward that it needs to include ""subject to appropriations"" kind of language in any mandatory statute. My question is, if we rule against you, are there other existing statutory problems lurking out there in the interim? Well, one of the problems is we don't know what -- what may be out there.
Statutes -- I mean, we -- there -- there are other ""shall pay"" situations, but, again, they -- there's usually not -- in -- in this type of program, which is a generalized subsidy for people participating out there, when Congress wants to commit itself to making payments to private people, it usually does it through specific instruments, through contracts and through grants.
And that is -- I don't know -- -- that is the way Congress -- Mr. Kneedler -- -- I don't know why legislation can't be regarded as just as specific as the contracts.
And I think -- in other words, you keep saying a generalized subsidy.
Is that just a repeat of your -- your argument? In other words, no money-mandating language can be considered to create an obligation on the part of the government because you would call that, without an appropriations provision, simply a subsidy? Well, I -- I -- I'm trying to draw a distinction between the situation where there might be a bilateral relationship either in contract or in all of the cases -- Oh, I know, and I'm trying to push you to the -- to see where the limits of your argument are.
With -- without regard to any type of appropriations language, there is no situation -- when the government makes a promise to an entity to engage in activity, to climb the flagpole in -- in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, there's no way that that would be regarded as money-mandating if it weren't subject -- if there -- there weren't appropriations language? I -- I think that would be the general rule, but let me point out here, there -- there's no language of promise in this -- in this statute.
There's no language of entitlement on the part of the -- of the insurance companies. ""Shall pay,"" right? Well, it's an instruction to an agency to pay, but when you have an instruction to an agency to do anything, it is always conditioned -- Well, I guess -- -- upon the -- -- we would have thought, it's not so much even that the agency will keep its promise but that the agency will keep its promise to the government.
I mean, right? I mean, are you suggesting just because the government told the agency to pay, that doesn't mean the agency has to? No, no.
Well, the agency -- the agency can't under the Constitution because an appropriation is not available.
And there's one other piece of the -- I'm sorry, let me -- let me stop there just a moment. Following your analogy, and -- and I do understand it.
You're saying it's not a contract with the recipients because this is a order to the Secretary.
And the order -- Yes. -- to the Secretary says, devise a program, pay out this amount to the participants who suffer a shortfall, and it says that's the program you have to set up.
So that's the program that they set up in 2014. They give assurances that the government has promised to pay.
And in 2015, they say, the appropriations bill limits how I can pay you, but it doesn't rescind and it doesn't tell me not -- that you won't be paid. They say that over and over again, 2014, at the end of it, 2015, 2016.
The GAO manual, which is the bible for Congress, says what you tell the Secretary to do, he will do. So why isn't this an enforceable contract where the government is bound? The agency was -- acted consistent to the legislation and to the directives of Congress. Well -- He didn't offer the money because he couldn't, but he did exactly what this bill told him to do. The -- and -- and that's why the compliance with the Constitution and compliance with a statutory framework is not a violation of law that gives rise to an implied damage remedy in the -- in the Court of Claims. And one other piece of the -- But you can't -- you can't say to me that Congress is not empowered to empower the Secretary to act. Congress can tell the Secretary to enter a contract, can't he? Yes, but if -- on that score, if I could just point out, 31 U.S.C. 1302(d), Congress, in implementing its control over appropriations, has itself adopted a rule of construction. And under -- under that statute, it says that a law shall not be construed to make an appropriation or to authorize contracts in advance unless it specifically states so.
That is a clear -- an -- Mr. Kneedler -- -- a fortiori -- -- are -- are insurers obligated to pay in if they have excess profits? Yes, it is a user fee. So this is one where the ""shall pay in"" is obligatory but the ""shall pay out"" on the part of the government is not obligatory? The -- the -- the pay in is not subject to -- is not an appropriations question.
It is an obligation.
And -- and -- and that part -- that part of the arrangement, the -- the reciprocity in the -- in the program still exists, the payments in and pay -- payments out, which is how I think most -- I mean, you pay in, that's obligatory.
We commit ourselves to paying out.
It turns out if we feel like it. What -- what kind of -- what kind of a statute is that? I -- I -- I don't think that's a fair characterization because just like -- just like any -- just like any program where Congress directs the Secretary of whatever department to establish a program, the Secretary can't go forward with that without appropriations. That includes a subsidy program.
That includes a regulatory program, all manner of programs.
And that's what happened here.
It would be a dramatic change for this Court to say that when -- when Congress says that an agency shall establish a program and pay out money under that, that if Congress declines to appropriate the money for it, that gives rise to a implied cause of action in the -- under the Tucker Act. We have three reasons why that shouldn't be so.
Justice Ginsburg's point that -- against implied causes of action, the Amtrak case that says an act of Congress is not to be construed to create contractual or -- or vested rights in private persons, and the appropriations clause and its implementation in 1302(d) that says, absent a clear statement, an Act shall not be -- not be read to be an appropriation or to provide contract authority. The result the Petitioners seek here is essentially to make 1342 an appropriation as the source of money to be paid out under the Judgment Fund, but the Judgment Fund is available only if there's a violation.
And there's no violation to begin with. But even if -- even if you thought that there was a -- a commitment, a binding commitment of some sort, the Appropriations Act here, Congress clearly intended not to -- not to provide for payment. So I think in respect for the way in which appropriations have been understood and Congress's power over appropriations have been understood for hundreds of years, it's important for this Court to not impose monetary -- an implied monetary liability under -- under the -- under the Tucker Act and to extend Langston from its very modest context of a salary to which the statute said he was entitled, language that is not present here, to impose liability on the government in billions of dollars not -- It's a modest context -- -- subject to a funding -- -- but isn't it the same principle? I don't think it is the same principle because -- And the distinction is the salary? The salary of someone who is working for the government, and one -- the statute said he was entitled to it.
Again, we don't have that here.
But even without that language, I think one would -- one would think of someone working for the government, he's delivering services to the government, the pay that is owed him, is -- is in reciprocity for that. That's far different from a subsidy program in which -- in which Congress without a contract, without a bilateral relationship, without an individualized promise, has made money available under a generalized subsidy program. That's -- that is a huge, huge difference.
And all the cases in Justice Scalia's opinion, dissenting opinion in Bowen versus Massachusetts, are employment cases, and -- and he's saying, yes, you can go to the Tucker Act on employment cases.
But -- but that's vastly different from the statutory arrangement we have here. Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Five minutes, Mr. Clement. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to just start off with Justice Kagan's point that the government takes the payment in obligation with the exact same language to be absolutely mandatory. And I assure you, if one of my clients when presented with a bill said, well, we have a bunch of internal rules at our company and I actually can't disburse the funds until I get approval from the treasury division at our company, I don't think the government would be impressed by that and they certainly wouldn't say that the mandatory obligation just somehow disappeared because the rule said we didn't have the funds to pay it at that particular moment. I'd also like to talk about the ""subject to appropriations"" language because that's not just a feature of many other provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
I asked one of my associates to look at how many times that appears in the U.S. Code.
When he gave me 200, I told him he could stop. This is a recurring provision in the U.S. Code and they would wipe out 200 references to subject of appropriations, they would mean absolutely nothing. Text matters here.
Obviously, they don't want to talk about the text of the appropriations riders because the text doesn't have language that says repeal, it doesn't limit payments out to payments in.
It doesn't even have the ""this or any other act"" language that was at issue in Will or Dickerson. And to be clear, that's not because Congress forgot how to use that phrase.
The same 2015 Appropriations Act had multiple provisions that failed to appropriate funds and said no funds available under this or any other act. There were also provisions in that same 2015 appropriations bill that expressly repealed substantive provisions.
So Congress knows how to repeal.
It knows how to emphatically limit funds.
It didn't do that here. Another point that I want to make clear here is just my friend has used the term ""subsidy"" a lot in describing this program. This really doesn't feel like a subsidy because nobody -- none of my clients get paid a penny unless they suffer actual losses. So this is not a great subsidy program if the only way you can get paid a penny is if you lose lots of money by losing money by providing your products on the exchanges.
So what I would describe this program as is essentially more like an insurance program. The government says we very much want you to do this, and if you do it and lose money in the process, we shall pay a percentage of your losses.
That's why this retroactivity here is so pernicious, because what could be worse than getting an insurance policy and at the point that you actually suffer a loss and try to make a claim, they say: Oh, I'm sorry, we -- we -- we just decided we weren't going to fund that policy, even though you performed, even though you suffered actual losses.
So I really wouldn't describe this as a subsidy program. My friend on the other side suggested that there's no case law one way or another on this.
I just respectfully disagree. I think White Mountain Apache, I think Mitchell, the 1983 Mitchell decision, sometimes referred to as Mitchell II, are cases where this Court said there's money mandating directly from a statute.
And those were Indian trust cases where the direction was much less specific than this. You shall administer this property in a trust.
And the Court found an action there. There, you really had to do some inferring and some implying to get to the cause of action, not so with respect to this kind of direct ""shall pay"" obligation. My friend also relied a lot on the Amtrak case.
I think it's worth taking a closer look at that case, because the kind of contract at issue there was the kind of contract that would essentially bind the federal government in perpetuity and prevent them even from taking action prospectively. So, there, it was basically about whether the employees of the railroads that got consolidated into Amtrak were going to get essentially a free pass for life.
And the Court in that context said, well, we don't want to bind future Congresses forever on that. But this is different.
This is whether you're going to be bound to a contract where the counterparty has already performed to their detriment.
And in those circumstances, I don't think there should be any special rule. Again, I think the two paragraphs in the Bowen dissent are exactly right.
I think this is a unilateral contract that's accepted through performance, and then the government has to pay. But, if for some reason you think you don't get a contract unless the statute says the word contract, then you just treat it as a statutory obligation to pay. My friend said that all those cases that Justice Scalia relied on are salary cases. That's not actually true.
There are also pension benefit cases there for pensions that are available or special benefits that are available to law enforcement officers and firefighters.
So this is not some principle that's been limited strictly to the context of salary provisions. And my final point is on what Congress was trying to accomplish here.
There is no question that they wanted to get the insurance companies to provide these policies.
But there is equally no question that they wanted the premiums to be relatively low. And in thinking about the billions of dollars that this failure to uphold their obligations is going to cost the government, you shouldn't lose sight of the fact that they also saved billions of dollars in tax subsidies by reducing the premiums through this -- through this commitment. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-9526, McGirt versus Oklahoma. Mr. Gershengorn. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is resolved by the fundamental proposition that decisions about sovereign rights are for Congress to make and Congress makes those decisions by speaking clearly in the text.
The decision below must be reversed because the text makes clear that Congress never terminated the Creek reservation and never transferred federal criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma. I have four basic points to make this morning.
First, the Creek Nation had a reservation.
The relevant treaties reserved the lands from sale and solemnly guaranteed the lands for the Creek to govern.
The text of both treaties and statutes expressly identified the Creek land as a reservation.
Nothing more was needed. Second, Congress did not establish -- disestablish that reservation.
Indeed, Congress considered hallmark language of disestablishment and rejected it.
Congress initially sought cession yet instead provided only for allotment. Then, when congressional inaction would have dissolved the tribe, Congress instead preserved the tribe and its government for all purposes authorized by law, and it did so against the backdrop of existing tribal authority to legislate over reservation land.
Those congressional judgments should be respected. Third, Congress did not transfer criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma.
At statehood, the Major Crimes Act established exclusive federal jurisdiction over enumerated crimes in ""any state of the United States."" When Congress overrides the Major Crimes Act and transfers jurisdiction to a state, it does so expressly, and it did not do so here. Finally, Oklahoma's rhetoric about disruption does not change the result.
On the criminal side, this Court's decision in Ramos is a complete answer, and on the civil side, the main issues are tax and other regulatory issues that are routinely resolved by tribal-state agreements.
In any event, Parker makes clear that questions of sovereignty are distinct from claims of reservation status. This Court should resolve the reservation question, leaving jurisdictional disputes to Congress, the relevant sovereign, and then for this Court to resolve if and when they arise. Counsel, the -- So let me start this -- -- State argues that the territory should be analyzed as a dependent Indian community under 1151 and not as a reservation.
They base this argument on our decisions in Sandoval and Creek Nation and 1151 itself and the fact that the Creeks have always maintained, have been adamant about the fact that they are not reservation Indians. Now you refer, of course, to the many times in which the treaty is referred to as a reservation, but what is your answer to the State's analysis of our precedent? So, Your Honor, I think both the precedent and the language support the idea that this is not a dependent Indian community.
What this Court said in Venetie and what Judge -- then Judge Gorsuch said in Hydro Resources is that the dependent Indian community label is a catchall for tribes that did not have a reservation and are not on restricted lands.
The best evidence of what Congress thought about whether Creek lands were a reservation under the statute is that Congress referred to those lands as a reservation under the statute. With respect to Sandoval and the other cases, it is crystal-clear that when Sandoval and those cases are using the term ""dependent Indian community"" that they are describing tribes and other groups that are within Congress's broad power to legislate for -- for tribes broadly.
They are not excluding the -- the Creek. Indeed, and -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes, counsel.
In Solem and in Parker, those cases only involved the disposition of surplus land.
And, here, of course, there's much, much more being done in a whole series of statutes involving both sovereignty and the allotment of land. Can you point to any case in which we've applied the Solem fact framework to a case that does as much as this -- as being -- as is being done in this case? So, Your Honor, I think the key point on -- the -- the -- the key point on the Parker/Solem analysis is, as your -- as Your Honor pointed out in that opinion, that those are not -- that that analysis doesn't derive from anything special about -- about how much work Congress is doing. The reason the Court has always required plain text is because treaty rights are at issue and plain text is required to abrogate treaty rights and because sovereign rights are at issue and plain text is required to abrogate sovereign rights. So there's nothing magic about Parker and Solem in terms of whether they're dealing with surplus lands or not.
The key point in Parker and Solem is that plain text is required to do the kinds of transfers that are at issue here. And when you look at the plain text, I think this is a -- this case is even stronger than Your Honor's opinion in Parker for three main reasons.
First, of course, is that the tribe was not absent from the land in the same way that the tribe was in Parker. Second, the land here was allotted in -- almost entirely to the tribe -- to tribal members themselves, to Indians. And, third, Congress took steps in 1906 to preserve the tribe. And I guess the thing I would point to, Your Honor, when you ask about whether there are cases like this, I think this is stronger than case -- other cases because the question isn't just what did Congress fail to do but how much -- I don't mean to interrupt you, but I do want to get this point in, that in -- in Parker, we were only dealing with one allotment statute that was disposing of surplus land.
Here, we're dealing with a series of statutes that go both to land, the allotment of land, and to the reduction in the authority of the tribe.
That's what I mean. So I understand that, Your Honor.
And I think the critical point is that Congress actually preserved the tribe when it had the chance when inaction would have dissolved the tribe.
And so, actually, I think that makes this stronger than in other cases because Congress took -- Thank you. Thank you, counsel. -- deliberate action when this action dissolved -- Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? Counsel, you don't claim immunity from prosecution for a major crime.
I think your position is that the federal prosecutor could have charged your client? That's absolutely correct, Your Honor. Federal penalties, as I understand it, are at least as harsh as the state and in both forms, state and federal, you would have due process protections. So how are you harmed by the fact that you were tried in the state court rather than the federal court when you were exposed to the same -- at least the same penalties in both? So, Your Honor, I think the harm flows anytime that a defendant, a criminal defendant is tried by a sovereign that lacks jurisdiction.
I don't think that we have ever -- that this Court has ever said that there's a kind of harmless error analysis when a -- when a sovereign asserts jurisdiction, particularly criminal jurisdiction, over a defendant and that you would look to see, well, are the penalties the same. Of course, it is a different set of -- I mean, it's a different juror pool, it's a different -- it is a different set of potential penalties, and so I guess I don't think that the fact that -- that there would be a rigorous trial in federal court suggests that you would overlook the absence of jurisdiction. Indeed, it seems to me to make this case even easier in some ways because we are not claiming an immunity, as Your Honor pointed out, and, indeed, there would be a retrial in federal court if the Court were to -- Counsel -- -- to reverse. -- what makes this case hard is that there have been hundreds, hundreds of prosecutions, some very heinous offenses of the state law.
On your view, they would all become undone. And if you compare that to the situation in our recent Ramos case where there were the -- there's a question about redoing already tried cases, here, the Ramos retroactivity pales in comparison to what is involved here, hundreds of prosecutions, for murder, for terrible sexual offenses. These would all have to be done years later when the witnesses may not be there anymore.
It's hundreds of cases that -- So, Your Honor, there are hundreds of case -- there may be hundreds of cases.
Actually, in -- in truth, we don't know how many cases.
The State, which has the numbers, hasn't suggested that there are anything -- been able to document there are anything like hundreds of cases, but there are fewer than in Ramos. And in any event, what this Court said in Ramos was that that provides no reason to disregard the plain text.
To be sure, that there would be -- Thank you, counsel.
Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer? Good morning, counsel.
A minor point, but one of the -- one of the arguments, I think, is that whether they're a reservation or not, Congress wanted state courts to try the major state crimes. And in reference to that, I think the government cites Felix Cohen, who was a great expert in this area.
And I looked at his letter.
He does seem to say that. So, if you have any comments about that, about his argument or about that particular aspect of it, I'd like to hear them. So, Your Honor, I think that the -- the -- the law is clear that Congress did not intend for crimes -- for tribal crimes to be tried.
And I think this is one of the most straightforward statutory construction cases this Court will see. The Major Crimes Act at statehood provided that it applied to any state of the United States.
There is no exception for Oklahoma, and there was none before, at, or after statehood. Second, what they have pointed to, what the other side has pointed to, is what happened before statehood, and what happened before statehood was that crimes were being prosecuted in the name of the United States in courts set up by Congress, applying federal law, which the -- which had adopted Arkansas law as the rule of decision. It is the exact opposite of conferring jurisdiction on the states to try. Third, there was nothing in the Enabling Act that would have changed that. Indeed, the Enabling Act sent to federal courts all cases which, had they been committed in a state, would have been subject to federal prosecution.
That describes the Major Crimes Act perfectly. And finally, Your Honor, when Congress transfers jurisdiction to a state, it does so expressly.
In Nagonset, which this Court described as the first major transfer of jurisdiction, the language used was jurisdiction is conferred.
In Public Law 280, the states shall have jurisdiction. In New York, New York shall have jurisdiction.
And even in -- with respect to Oklahoma, in 1908, when they transferred -- when Congress transferred probate jurisdiction, it said the -- that the Oklahoma courts shall have jurisdiction. And so tribal -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito? You referred to the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but the language in that is that a case would be -- a case that was pending in the territorial court at the time of statehood would be sent to one of the new federal district courts or to one of the new state courts depending on where it would have been prosecuted if it had been prosecuted in a state. It doesn't say in a state in Indian Country.
It says in a state.
So isn't the clear meaning of that that cases in Oklahoma would be treated like cases anyplace else? So, Your Honor, I don't -- they -- treated like anyplace else, meaning it was subject to the Major Crimes Act. So I do -- I agree with you that there is no Oklahoma exceptionalism, but I think that cuts exactly in our favor. What Oklahoma is saying is that, uniquely among all the states in the union, it's exempt from the Major Crimes Act.
I think the Enabling Act, the language Your Honor is citing, does exactly the opposite. How about -- The language says -- -- what it said in the 1897 statute, which said that ""the laws of the United States enforced in the territory shall apply to all persons therein, irrespective of race."" And yet you're saying that cases at the time of statehood would be treated based on race.
How can that be consistent with the 1897 Act? Because I think the 1897 Act, Your Honor, extends if -- what the U.S. -- the 1897 Act does is extend both U.S. law and -- and the Arkansas law, regardless of race. But it did not eliminate any language that was in the Major Crimes Act already.
That was a portion of U.S. law.
But, regardless, Your Honor, of what happened pre-statehood -- I mean, we can debate that, but regardless of what happened pre-statehood, there's no disagreement that the Major Crimes Act applies of its own term at statehood. Statehood itself was a major event that transferred -- that -- that, obviously, transferred Oklahoma from a territory to a state.
And at that point -- What happened after -- what happened after statehood? Can you cite a single case under the Major Crimes Act that was transferred to or thereafter prosecuted in federal court? No, Your Honor.
But this Court has made clear that events on the ground don't override the text.
What -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? -- what we never interpret criminal statutes to be -- I'm sorry. -- what the executive -- Counsel, thank you. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, Justice Ginsburg pointed out that some of the penalties in federal court would be higher than those imposed in state court. Am I -- do you disagree that some defendants who might be entitled to raise -- if you were to win, some defendants who would be entitled to challenge their convictions would choose not to because the risk would be too high for them? I think that's exactly right, Your Honor.
I think that there are -- that federal penalties will often be higher.
I think a number of defendants will have already served large chunks of their -- of their -- of their sentence.
And their ability to seek relief in federal court at least will be limited by AEDPA.
So I think there are reasons to doubt the extent of the State's disruption argument here. And, again, remember the numbers are all in the State's control.
And so, while we've been hearing, you know, both in the Murphy argument and here about, you know, murderers and rapists getting through, in fact, there is no evidence that the State has put forward that they will be in large numbers and the kinds of habeas petitions that one would expect to see, the kind of tsunami that -- that has been predicted just hasn't materialized. So I -- I agree with Your Honor's question there. Number two, there's so much discussion about the dependent Indian community.
Am I to take it that your argument is that that's almost irrelevant? It is almost irrelevant.
It's both wrong and irrelevant, but I'll hit the irrelevant point first. Regardless of what you call it, as my colloquy with Justice Thomas tried to get at, the -- the -- the reason we have a plain text requirement has less to do with whether you call it a reservation or a dependent Indian community and everything to do with the fact that these boundaries were set up by Congress, and so, if you are going to undo that, Congress needs to speak and Congress needs to speak clearly. We're talking about transfers of sovereign rights, and that has to be done clearly in the text.
And you can call it a reservation or a dependent Indian community. The test would be the same. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? So, if I could pick up on that, Mr. Gershengorn, you said irrelevant and wrong.
And the Chief Justice asked you about our two cases, Sandoval and Creek Nation, and I wasn't quite sure I understood your answer to him about how those cases were using the term and whether that is consistent or inconsistent with your argument. So those -- it is consistent with our argument.
As I -- as I read both Sandoval and Creek Nation, it is using the term ""dependent Indian community"" to -- to describe the tribes -- the -- basically, tribes broadly, that those are -- are communities over which Congress has the power to legislate under its -- under its Indian-related powers. In other words, it was not using it in sort of the more narrow and technical sense that Congress did when it enacted the 1948 statute. So, in other words -- In other words, it's -- it's supposed to be an umbrella term that in -- That's exactly right, Your Honor. -- that integrates our standard reservations? Exactly.
It includes standard reservations -- it includes but is not limited to standard reservations. The whole point -- And how do we know that? Because that's what the Court said in Sandoval, is that the -- is that -- that it was -- it was trying to figure out whether Congress had the power to legislate for the Pueblos, and -- and what it said was Congress has the power to legislate both domestic and -- old and new communities and use the term ""dependent Indian communities."" But, again, regardless, the Tribe has always -- the Creek have always been -- the reason the -- the Pueblos were compared to the Creek is because the Creek were assumed to be the quintessential reservation.
In other words, the fee patent in the Pueblos couldn't be a problem because it wasn't a problem for the Creeks, and everybody understood the Creeks were -- had a reservation.
I think that was the sense in which the Court was using the term. Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Hello? Justice Gorsuch? Thank you, Chief. Counsel, we've heard a little bit about it today, but I'd -- I'd like to give you a chance to discuss further the argument that there are going to be terrible practical consequences that would follow from a ruling for your clients.
We can put aside the criminal convictions -- you've addressed those -- but just the on-the-ground difficulties we've heard about in administering Tulsa. A, do you want to respond to the -- that parade of horribles generally? And, B, how should that inform our analysis of and interpretation of a statute and a treaty? So, Your Honor, I would -- broadly, here's what I would say: There are -- there -- there will, of course, be consequences from the Court's ruling, as there are from any of the Court's rulings, and those consequences are not trivial, but nor are they existential, nor, indeed, overly serious. But, more important, they are the kinds of consequences that happen routinely in Indian Country.
They are routinely resolved by agreement in Oklahoma, as Representative Cole's brief indicates, and throughout the nation, as the MCI brief and the experience of Tacoma indicates.
And -- and these are routinely addressed by Congress. With respect to how it should -- should influence the text, it should not affect the reading of the text, and that's true for several reasons.
First, the text is what the text is, and this Court's job is to interpret it. Second, in Parker itself, the Court distinguished the two.
It separated reservation status from questions of sovereignty and the impact on the ground.
And I think this Court should take the same approach.
Those two questions are distinct. And then, third, it shouldn't affect this Court's analysis of the text because Congress is in the best place to change the text and add text if it wants.
And, indeed, Congress routinely does in Indian Country, and Congress has in Oklahoma.
There are Oklahoma-specific statutes that address environmental matters, that take power -- that ensure that power stays with the state, not the tribe.
Congress knows how to do this, and the job to fix any consequences if the Court perceives them is with Congress. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief. And good morning, Mr. Gershengorn.
I want to talk a bit about the history and maybe make a comment, and you and other -- your colleagues can react. But this is not a situation where there's a reservation in an existing state and Congress has arguably diminished a reservation. This is a case with a territory that, by 1890, Indian territory was predominantly white, about 60 percent of the population, also a significant black population, about 10 percent, and about 30 percent Indian. And the question, as of 1890, how do we get there to that situation, you go back to the treaties of 1832 and 1833 that grant the Creeks and the Five Tribes land, but then the Civil War is key, and the tribes, the Five Tribes, all align with the Confederacy in the Civil War.
The tribes have black slaves, lots of black slaves.
And then there's a new treaty in 1866 because the United States is not happy that the tribes have aligned with the Confederacy. Why does that matter for us? Because, in that new treaty in 1866, it grants rights-of-way to railroads, the railroads lead to settlements, the settlements lead to new towns that are predominantly white.
So, by 1890, you have an odd situation of an Indian territory nominally that's predominantly white. So Congress's options at that time are -- are to remove the -- the whites, to remove the Indians.
Neither of those was going to happen.
So the other remaining options were tribal government over non-Indians, which, of course, is contrary to tradition, or to create a new state.
And Congress chose the new state option, it seems, and then had a lot of things that happened over the next 17 years. So I just wanted to get that history out there because I think we're talking about Indian territory and reservations when, in fact, it was 60 percent white, 10 percent black, 30 percent Indian in the relevant territory. Counsel, you have time for a very brief comment. So I'll just say very briefly, Your Honor, after statehood, the -- 85 percent of the Indian territory remained in Indian hands, immune from taxation.
The idea that statehood and reservation status are inconsistent is refuted by the fact that Tennessee was 75 percent reservation at statehood.
At statehood in South Dakota, it was 47 percent reservation. I think Your Honor's sense of the history and the incompatibility of reservations with statehood is not historically accurate. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanji. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to go straight to Justice Thomas's question about the governing framework here and make three points.
First, there is nothing radical about the Parker/Solem framework.
It fused two ordinary principles of statutory construction and fundamental principles regarding the separation of powers. The state can't win under that test, and, hence, it has advocated various amorphous alternatives.
I think, Justice Thomas, nothing about the fact that there was a series of statutes here changes the -- the fundamental principles that should apply. There are, to answer your question directly, other cases that have involved a series of statutes.
The Mast case involved a tremendous amount about the history of California's series of statutes and executive orders over time. Solem involved the creation of a -- of a reservation only eight months before statehood.
Every state likes to claim that its history is exceptional, but there's nothing about Oklahoma here that should cause a divergence from this Court's test. In the past, we -- Thank you, counsel.
I'd -- I'd like to return to Justice Alito's question.
Congress passed legislation at the turn of the prior century saying that the United States laws and the laws of Arkansas, which would be applied in Oklahoma, would apply to all persons therein, irrespective of race. Now, if you prevail, the laws in the eastern half of Oklahoma will be different.
The applicable law will be different, dependent upon race.
So how is that consistent with Congress's legislation? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
It's a critical question.
What the 1897 statute did was to apply federal law, irrespective of race, the territorial law and Arkansas law as assimilated. There was nothing radical about that. Under the General Crimes Act and the Assimilative Crimes Act, state law was often applied where federal law did not exist. But then what happens, of course, is this watershed moment of statehood, and statehood always changes the status quo.
And when it comes to Indians, what it does typically is reserves federal power over the Indians while, of course, giving state power over non-Indians to the states. And there's nothing in the Enabling Act or the Five Tribes Act that suggests that that status quo, the normal way of dealing with it, was supposed to be departed from. But I -- I would like an answer to the precise question, which is the law would be different in eastern Oklahoma depending upon race, right? Well, under the Enabling Act, yes, the -- the transfer to the state was of cases that would arise under state law.
What the federal courts retained were cases arising under federal law.
And that, of course, included the Major Crimes Act and the -- and the General Crimes Act. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes, Mr. Kanji, a brief question, and this is just -- it's not necessarily dispositive of this case, but I'm interested in your answer. Do you think a tribe can be effectively divested of title to land, to its land and its sovereignty, and still retain the status of reservation? It's a -- it's a critically interesting question, Your Honor. All -- all disestablishment cases involve a transformation of title.
Whether we're talking about trust cases or fee pay cases, Congress was getting rid of communal proper -- title and transferring title to individuals. So the question this Court resolves in that regard is whether Congress also meant to go beyond that and alter reservation boundaries which were so there.
And, here, where we simply are talking about the allotment and the opening up of small town sites to non-Indian settlers, that falls squarely into the rubric that this Court has designed where reservations have remained intact. With respect to sovereignty, if a sovereignty was to be completely divested -- and that's not what happened here -- but, if it was, I think the question this Court would ask is whether the federal government still meant to maintain the reservation for its own purposes. If it didn't, then the reservation would dissolve.
Here, if the tribe had been dissolved, the treaties make very clear that the reservation itself would have evaporated, but -- but -- and -- and I understand this is not the premise of your question, that is not what took place here.
The 1901 and 1906 acts clearly maintained a quantum of tribal governmental power. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? If you -- you are right, then what becomes of all the state tribal cooperative agreements that we're told about if the state lacks authority to apply its own law with increased territory, remaining as a cession to everything except what was given in the Civil War. Were all of the -- we're told that there are many, many state tribal cooperative agreements, but if the state lacks authority to apply its own law, what becomes of -- of all those state tribe cooperative agreements? The -- the agreements, Your Honor, will remain in full force and effect.
And this is critical.
If we prevail, state law does not evaporate in the reservation. Under this Court's doctrines, state law applies in many situations with respect to -- especially with respect to the non-Indians in the area. And that's what leads to these cooperative agreements.
Reservations involve the different jurisdictions all having authority, and that has been the premise of shared jurisdiction as underpinned these cooperative agreements. And the best thing I can point you to is not my words but the words of Congressman Cole's brief.
And that's a remarkable brief.
I think very few briefs like that have been filed in this Court in the area of state tribal relations where you have senior members of Congress, former governors, former state legislators saying, please do not disestablish this reservation because the exercise of tribal sovereignty in cooperation with the state has underpinned these agreements. And the authors of that brief were the authors of many of the agreements on the state side.
And it's this premise of shared jurisdiction that has allowed for shared governance in Oklahoma to the benefit of all citizens there.
And just as -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer? So I'm still interested in this claim the State makes that whether it's a reservation or not a reservation is beside the point, that all we have to decide here is whether Congress gave to a state court the power to try the state criminal crimes. And Felix Cohen points to three things where he thinks the answer to that question is yes, seems to.
First, they abolished tribal courts and put the criminal jurisdiction in the Indian court, the Indian territory courts, which are federal courts. Then, in the 1906 Act, it says that those territorial courts, which are federal, have the power to try state law cases.
Now they're not called state law cases then. They're called laws of the territory of Oklahoma. And then, in the 1907 Act, which is after, you know, the Enabling Act, it says all causes, civil or criminal, shall be proceeded with, held and determined by the courts of the state coming about, the successors of the district courts of the territory of Oklahoma, and the United States courts in the Indian territory. So it's rather ambiguous, this last thing.
But given the practice and given Felix Cohen and given you could read it that way, what do you think? I -- Your Honor, it would make my life much easier in this case if I could say there was plain text that had transferred jurisdiction to the state over the Indians.
As you know, there would be nothing inconsistent with that and reservation status. No. But we simply can't find that text.
I think the operative text, as Justice Alito said, ends up being the amended Section 16 of the Enabling Act, prosecutions for all crimes which had they been committed in the state would have been cognizable in the federal courts. Justice Alito? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, could you finish your answer to Justice Breyer, please? Absolutely, Justice Sotomayor.
The cases that would have been cognizable in federal court, if Oklahoma had been a state, included prosecutions under the Major Crimes Act or the General Crimes Act.
The Enabling Act is very clearly saying that those are to be transferred to federal court. As to the practice, this is critical. Nationwide, around the nation, states were arrogating criminal jurisdiction to themselves and the federal government was abdicating it, even in cases where the reservations clearly remained intact.
That happened in South Dakota, the Solem case.
That happened in Nebraska, the Parker case.
That happened in Washington State, the Seymour case.
That happened in Mississippi, United States v. John case.
In all four of those cases, this Court unanimously, across different eras, different compositions of this Court, paid no heed to that practice for this fundamental reason: the acts of Executive Branch officials cannot subvert the will of Congress.
Those acts of Executive Branch officials do not run the gauntlet of bicameralism and presentment. And here is all the more reason not to pay those heed.
We know -- we know that federal officials were subverting the will of Congress in Oklahoma.
After statehood, they would not allow the Creek Nation to hold elections for its chief, for its national council, even though the Five Tribes Act clearly preserved those powers. So why we should pay heed to the acts of federal officials when they were clearly acting illegally is something that the state has -- has never explained. Counsel, could we go back to Justice Thomas's question? Am I to understand that in existing reservations outside of this Creek Nation issue, there are fee-simple possessions by non-Indians, non-Indians are living, working on those reservations? And am I to understand there's concurrent federal, state, and Indian jurisdiction over many of the issues involved with those people? Correct, Your Honor. Wherever there's fee-simple land in -- in a reservation, there is concurrent jurisdiction. So you really can't tie -- So, Justice Alito? Am I correct that more than 90 percent of the people who live in the area directly affected by this case are not members of the Creek tribe? That is correct, Your Honor. Well, what would you say to those people when we -- if we decide this case in your -- in your favor? Won't they be surprised to learn that they are living on a reservation and that they are now subject to laws imposed by a body that is not accountable to them in any way? There -- there are a number of responses, Your Honor.
First, very little will change for them.
Certainly, very little to the bad will change for them.
They will largely remain subject to state law.
They will benefit in significant ways from reservation status.
Justice Breyer asked a question at the last argument about the Tulsa businessman.
Well, that businessman could wake up the day after the argument and qualify for enterprise grants that attach to reservation status. But what -- what would be the -- what will be the extent of the tribe's authority over these non-Indians? For example, if any member of the tribe has a contract dispute with a non-member, say it's about an employment contract or a lease or the purchase of goods, will the -- the tribal member be able to sue the non-Indian in tribal court under tribal law? In -- no, Your Honor.
In -- assuming that this takes place on fee lands, which is the -- as you've noted, the majority of lands in the reservation, under this Court's precedents, it's clear that absent affirmative consent, no, that case would proceed in state court. The tribe presumptively -- tribal law presumptively would not apply to non-Indians with respect to activities taking place on fee land. Well, if this were a different reservation and a non-Indian chose to do business there, knew that he or she was entering a reservation, was doing business there, that would be considered to be consent, would it not? Well, the -- this Court's precedents are, honestly, a little unclear on that.
But, if there was some form of affirmative expression of consent, that would bring the case within tribal jurisdiction. But there will be -- Justice Kagan? Mr. Kanji, could I ask you to continue and -- you're talking about the consequences of this, and focus particularly about adoptions and foster care proceedings, because I know there's been some concern about that. Thank you, Your Honor. There -- there's been some, well, frankly, rhetoric about that.
But it's misplaced.
On the ground, the state agency, the Health and Human Services Agency, and the Nation cooperate in every ICWA case.
They have a terrific relationship, and they have both been involved in the placement of Indian children. That will not change if the reservation boundaries are affirmed.
There are various mechanisms to formalize that -- those agreements.
Section 1919 allows the state and the Nation to continue sharing jurisdiction, for the state courts to retain jurisdiction where there are existing placements, or under Section 1915 for the Nation to ordain those placements. There is simply no cause to think that existing placements will be disrupted.
That is not in the interests of the Nation, the parents, or the children, and it will not happen. And with respect to all of these disruption questions, what role do you think that our decision in City of Sherrill plays? Well, I -- Sherrill has a -- has a -- Sherrill is always in the room when the states and the tribes are negotiating agreements.
It's really, honestly, a thumb on the scale on the side of the states.
So, when it comes to all the fabric of cooperative agreements we have in place currently, those will continue.
We have terrific working relationships, as the Cole brief exemplifies, and it will continue to play that role. Now, if there were ever a situation where the Nation were to assert sovereignty in a way that went beyond the bounds of those agreements and that the state took umbrage with, you know, Sherrill is an arsenal in -- in the state's --- that the states can employ in -- in those stations. But what Sherrill makes very clear is that there's a clear distinction between reservation boundaries and whether they exist or not and what equitable defenses might apply to the assertion of tribal authority within those boundaries. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, there's been a fair amount of discussion so far this morning about the Oklahoma Enabling Act and the suggestion that it's inconceivable that Congress would have admitted a new state to the Union where a significant portion of the state would have been a federal reservation subject to the Major Crimes Act. And I'm not sure we've given you all a fair chance to have at that, so I'd -- I'd appreciate a thorough response to that question. Thank you, Justice Gorsuch. There's nothing inconsistent between the advent of statehood and reservation boundaries.
The Solem case makes that patently clear.
The Cheyenne River reservation and the Rosebud Sioux reservation were ordained eight months before statehood.
Congress clearly -- and they -- they accounted for about 10 percent of states' land mass alone. Congress clearly understood at this time that states could come into being with significant reservation masses.
Arizona became a state shortly after Oklahoma, and that was 27 percent of the state's land mass. This Court, by that time, had recognized that state jurisdiction in the criminal area and the civil area could pertain to non-Indians on reservations and had established this framework of concurrent jurisdiction that still persists to today. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice, and good morning. As I mentioned in the last comment, I think we have to understand what the situation was as of 1890, '90, to understand the text of these statutes, but I want to focus on the text, in particular, the text of the statute that abolishes the tribal courts and the text of the statute that creates, in essence, municipal towns within Indian territory during the 1890s and what the significance of those two statutes are for assessing sovereignty, because, ultimately, the question, as Justice Thomas suggested, I think, is what -- what's the status of legislative, executive, and judicial power. How should we think about those statutes with the tribal courts and the municipal towns? Mr. Chief Justice, I need just one minute to answer this question because it's -- it's critical, and it's an excellent question, Justice Kavanaugh.
With respect to -- That's exactly how much time you have. (Laughter.) Thank you.
With respect to the courts, it's critical to remember most tribes did not have tribal courts at this period of time.
It was a rarity that the Five Tribes did.
So, in restricting and in eliminating those tribal courts, Congress was merely putting them on the same plane as other tribes. And then, more generally speaking, with respect to the quantum of governmental powers, as you know, Justice Kavanaugh, Congress has regularly adjusted the metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty.
That's what this Court recognized in Lara but has never equated the quantum of power with the existence of the reservations themselves.
And if this -- On the tribal courts point, the difference, I think some would say, is that the other tribes were not governing a jurisdiction that was predominantly non-Indian, which is what was going on here. Any reaction to that? Yes, look at exactly what happened in 1901 and thereafter with the Allotment Act.
The tribal courts were gone, but the Secretary of the Interior continued to enforce the tribe's legislative authority. Section 42 made it very clear that that legislative authority persisted.
The Secretary enforced the tribal laws.
And this Court's decision in Hitchcock and the Eighth Circuit's decision in Buster make it crystal-clear that the tribe's legislative authority persisted after the Acts in question were -- were enacted. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. General Mansinghani. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Oklahoma has jurisdiction over the eastern half of the state because it never was reservation land and is certainly not reservation land today.
To start, the land was not public land preserved from sale, where title remains with the United States, but instead patented in fee to the Creek Nation. That is why this Court in U.S. v. Creek Nation called it a former dependent Indian community.
And under Venetie, it clearly lost that status when the fee patent was dismantled. Now, assuming the land was a reservation, Congress stripped away all semblance of reservation status.
Solem asks us whether Congress's purpose was to divest the tribe of all its interest in the land, and, here, statute after statute did precisely that. The Curtis Act ended tribal governance of the land, the allotment agreement divested the tribe of all its rights, title, and interest, and even allotments were quickly stripped of federal superintendents.
Everyone at the time read these statutes to mean the state had jurisdiction and the land was not a reservation. Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gershengorn, in response to a question from Justice Kagan, argued that ""dependent Indian community"" was an umbrella term that included reservation.
I'd like to get your response to that. See, I think that definition would completely make 1151(b) surplusage.
It would read it right out of the statute.
What this Court said in Venetie is that tribes with land in fee are ""unalike Indians living on reservations,"" citing Sandoval, which compares the -- the -- the Pueblos, who had a dependent Indian community, as essentially the same as the Five Tribes. And in Creek Nation, this Court said that the Five Tribes had a fee simple, not the usual Indian right of occupancy, which is what is typical of reservations, and it was a dependent Indian community. And then Congress went out and codified Sandoval as a -- as a type of land status separate and apart from reservations, which is what this Court held in Venetie. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes.
Counsel, the -- I'm very interested in your point that this -- we should characterize this as a dependent nation.
First -- I'd like you, first, to say whether -- why you think that and why it matters. And -- and opposing counsel seems to think that it's irrelevant and, as he said, as I recall, that it's also wrong, your assessment of that.
So it gives you an opportunity to both respond to that and to explain to us why it is important. So why is it a dependent Indian community.
First, as I said, the -- Venetie said that tribes holding their land under restricted fee are unlike Indians living on reservations.
Sandoval and Creek Nation confirmed that.
And as far as -- it doesn't meet the definition of a reservation. I'll take the definition from Hagen v. Utah, land belonging to United States that is reserved from sale and set apart for public uses.
And in Pine River, this Court said ""reserved from sale"" means the fee remains in the United States. Well, issuing a fee patent is not reserving it from sale.
It's selling it.
Why? It makes sense.
Making land alienable to non-Indians in a dependent Indian community ends the dependent Indian community status.
That's what this Court said in Venetie and that's what then Judge -- Judge Gorsuch at the Tenth Circuit said in Hydro Resources on page 1163 in Footnotes 11 and 30 of his opinion. And that makes textual and logical sense because there's a textual difference between 1151(a), which says that a reservation remains one notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and 1151(b), which doesn't contain that language and defines dependent Indian communities.
Again, Judge Gorsuch pointed that out in Hydro Resources. It also makes logical sense because, if what created the land was the fee patent, the opposite of that, the conveyance of the fee patent disestablishes.
That's in accordance with this Court's decision in Hagen v. Utah, where it said reservation is reserving land from the public domain, so restoring land to the public domain ends the reservation. Justice Ginsburg? If -- if the tribe -- if the reservation had been disestablished, would the tribe have any governing authority and, if so, over what? Would the Major Crimes Act apply, or would exclusive prosecutorial authority for state crimes lie in the state courts? So the tribe would have their governments in -- in that they would have control over their own internal affairs and managing their property interests, which, if you look to the tribal understanding at the time, as we -- as we quote in our Respondent's appendix, is exactly what the tribe understood their own authority to be. As far as would they have any authority over land, there is some land that is under their original fee patent, so the River Spirit Casino in Tulsa is built on the riverbed of the Arkansas River because that land was never allotted.
So they have governing authority over that land, over trust land, and over restricted allotments, but we think the state, nonetheless, has jurisdiction over all of the state pursuant to the transfer of state -- to -- to state jurisdiction in the Enabling Act, which, you know, the -- the -- what Congress had done in the Indian territory is say the Indian territory is an area where Indians and non-Indians are treated alike.
Then the Enabling Act in Section 21 extended federal law except where not local -- where locally inapplicable. And it was locally -- the Major Crimes Act was locally inapplicable in the Indian territory because the 1897 Act is the act that conferred jurisdiction, not the Major Crimes Act, which is why Petitioner can't cite a single Major Crimes Act case during this period, before statehood or after. This question was asked before, but what are -- what are the congressional prescriptions that, in Oklahoma, all residents are subject to the same law, irrespective of race? I think that lays the framework of what Congress was trying to do in make -- in -- in creating the State of Oklahoma, which was to transform the governance of the state and the land ownership of the state, which was exclusively tribal, to a place where both Indians and non-Indians could both own land and be governed by the same state government. If you look at pages 23 -- 22 to 25 of our brief, we lay out that history and -- and lay out that that is what Congress said explicitly in legislative reports, that's what the Dallas Commission report said, and that's what the tribes recognize in their own tribal understanding. Justice Breyer? No, thank you. I'll -- I'll pass. Justice Alito? Justice Alito? Yes.
Mr. Gershengorn has a section of his brief that's labeled The Sky Is Not Falling, and his argument is that you and the federal government are exaggerating the effect of this decision, that it won't have such a major impact either in the criminal or in the civil area. Is he right in that? No, Justice Alito. So let me -- let me put some -- some solid numbers on this.
We have currently over 1700 inmates whose crimes were committed in the former Indian territory who identify as Native American.
So the state presumptively would not have jurisdiction over those people and have to release them. And that is probably half the actual number because it doesn't include crimes committed against Indians, which the state would not have jurisdiction over, so we're talking here about potentially around 30 -- over 3,000 inmates we may have to turn over. As far as future cases go, there were 32,000 felonies committed in the former Indian territory, an area that is about 12 percent Native American.
So only including crimes committed by Native Americans, that would be 4,000 new felonies a year that the federal government would have to prosecute.
Including crimes that -- where the Native American is the victim, you can take that to about 8,000. On the civil side, what -- on the civil side, what happens is it creates precisely the differential legal treatment between non-Indians and Indians that Congress tried to abolish when it -- when it created the State of Oklahoma. So non-Indians would not be subject to -- presumptively to state zoning law, to dog law, as Justice Breyer mentioned, and that creates a disparity between Indians and non-Indians.
So now Indian -- non-Indian businesses are competing on an unequal playing field with Indian businesses.
That's just one example. The Tulsa brief points out examples of, on restricted allotments, how Indians are erecting billboards in residential neighborhoods, are selling fireworks in them, but -- but that's in the few areas, the 2 percent of land that remains restricted allotment. If the entire area is a reservation, then you're -- you're creating the two separate societies that Congress had sought to abolish when it passed the dozen statutes it did in creating Oklahoma. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, with the latter part of all of the parade of horribles that you set forth, Congress can come in and change all of that.
Congress can give the state jurisdiction over anything it might be missing if we were to hold this was a reservation.
They have done so with respect to many other reservations across the country.
So this is easily fixable by Congress. Putting that aside, what do we do with the treaty language here that resulted as -- after the Trail of Tears with the Creek Nation? That Nation was wrenched from its homeland, marched to Oklahoma, and then given a treaty as recompense which guaranteed its sovereignty. I'm not sure that there's any other dependent Indian community that depends on a treaty right that extends or recognizes sovereignty.
So can you point to any, number one? Number two, if there isn't, why aren't we back at Solem and Parker? Is there anything explicitly that terminated the reservation in the history that you've recounted? Let me try to take those questions in order.
Congress can't fix the retroactive consequences here.
As far as the -- the -- the dependent Indian community, I think the Pueblos have sovereignty over their land.
It may not have been via treaty, but the idea that a dependent Indian community versus reservation turns on treaty rights would actually -- is actually nowhere present in this Court's case law.
It -- and -- and -- and on top of that, would actually undermine lots of reservations that were not created by treaty but by executive order.
So Petitioner's position would actually undermine Indian Country around the country. And then, third, as far as specific language, I think I'm going to go to Justice Thomas's point, which is cession, as this Court said in Rosebud Sioux, means the surrender of territory or jurisdiction.
And, here, you have the explicit surrender of territory and jurisdiction. The Curtis Act said tribal law shall not be enforced.
The -- the -- the allotment agreement said all right, title, and interest is divested.
You combine those two things together, that's enough to say that there was no reservation status.
But, on top of that, you have a bunch of other statutes that do even more things than that, that make it absolutely clear. The -- Justice Kagan? General, if we could go back to this dependent Indian community question, which is a complicated one because, of course, our -- our use of language can change over such an extended period of time, but when I look back at some of these cases that were decided around the same time that Creek Nation was decided, it seems as though the case for Mr. Gershengorn's view, which is that this term was meant to be an umbrella term, is -- is a pretty strong one.
And, specifically, a case called McGowan, which relied on another case called Pelican, talked about the broad use of the term ""dependent Indian community"" and said that whether it was -- whether something was a reservation or a colony was irrelevant because both were dependent Indian communities. And then Felix Cohen says in his treatise, speaking of these cases, he says -- and I'm quoting here -- ""All Indian reservations are also dependent Indian communities, unless they are uninhabited."" So could you comment on that? I think you have to read it as well taking into account Venetie, which says that tribal -- tribes with their land in fee are unlike Indians living on reservations. I -- I don't think you could read 1151(b) as just completely the same as what's in 1151(a) and -- and -- and (c), but more than that, a reservation has to be land reserved from sale.
And, here, the land wasn't reserved from sale.
It -- it was sold.
It was -- it was given to the Creek Nation in exchange for their lands in fee simple. So if -- if you read the -- Well, that's a different kind of argument.
Excuse me, General. That's a different kind of argument.
That's -- that's the argument that fee simple is itself inconsistent with reservation status. And aren't there other tribes that also have been given land in fee simple that have been recognized as reservations? No.
And thank you for the opportunity to address that.
So the Creek Nation points to the Seneca in New York as having fee simple, but they yielded their land not by cession but by selling all their right to private parties in 1797 and in 1842. So, under their theory, all of western New York and the City of Buffalo is still an Indian reservation, which would be highly disruptive.
The -- they also point to the Wyandotte, an 1817 treaty, but they neglect to mention the 1818 supplemental treaty that relinquished the right to a patent and instead gave them a -- a reservation. So our position would disrupt no land anywhere.
And -- and, in 2015, by the way, the Second Circuit looked at the Senecas' restricted fee land in the Buffalo area and it said, you know what it is? It's a dependent Indian community.
Since then, the thought of every court -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I have four questions.
I'm going to tick them off as fast as I can, and you can choose which ones you want to respond to in the time you have. First, can you explain to me why the fact that the land is in fee simple would lead to a less stringent disestablishment test than Solem? I guess I don't understand why that would be the case. Second, at least in the briefs, you make a lot of later demographics and evidence about what's happened.
I -- I guess I'm struggling to think why that should be relevant in an interpretation of statutes from the last century, especially when later demographic evidence sometimes shows nothing more than that states have violated Native American rights, including Oklahoma's, for example, enforcement of its state laws on -- on tribal lands against tribal members in the past. And then, third, practical impossibility arguments, if you could address what's wrong with what is in the brief by Robert Henry about how states often work with tribal entities. And then, finally, fourth, I would have thought that after Carpenter versus Murphy, we might have seen a tsunami of -- of cases if there were a real problem here that we haven't -- we haven't seen. So any of those you want to take up, feel free. I'll do my best, Justice Gorsuch. Why does it mean less protection? We're not saying it's less protection or more protection.
That is a false paradigm. Congressional intent controls regardless.
1151 is not a sliding scale of protection, with reservations or dependent Indian communities being more or less. Now they did have more rights with respect to the title, which is why Congress decided they needed tribal agreement, but the tribe agreed to divest itself of that title. But, when it comes to dependent Indian communities, what -- what you said in Hydro Resources and what Venetie said in -- is that dependent Indian communities, when -- when the land becomes alienable, it's no longer part of the dependent Indian community.
And that's based on the text of -- textual differences between 1151(a) and 1151(b). As far as what happened upon statehood, we're not relying on what happened 100 years after statehood.
We're relying upon the tribal understanding, the federal understanding, and the understanding of federal judges during the process and as the process was being implemented.
Federal judges at the moment of statehood transferred cases involving Indians to tribal -- to state courts. And the tribes understood, as we prove in our Respondent's appendix, that they would be subject to state law.
So what we're talking about here is the original tribal understanding and the original public meaning, and what they are trying to do is impose a modern lawyerly gloss on statutes enacted 100 years ago. So, if you look at the original understanding of how everybody implemented it, it is completely as Oklahoma is doing today. So the fact that there was -- there's no tsunami, we've had 178 people already seek relief under Murphy, even though the Murphy mandate has been stayed and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals' decision is still binding on state courts.
So that 178 cases are just the initial cracks in the dam, and that doesn't even include the state court filings that our office isn't -- isn't notified of.
So I -- I don't think that you can say that there's -- there's no tsunami coming. And then, as far as practical things, yes, we're going to try to work with the tribes as much as we can regardless of how this decision comes out.
We work with the tribes on a day-to-day basis in doing a lot of great things in the State of Oklahoma, but that doesn't -- Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, General.
I want to pick up on your comment earlier that Congress made clear that Indians and non-Indians were to be treated alike, and to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's reference to demographics, and follow up on what I said in my earlier questions. My understanding is that, as of 1890, this was a very unusual situation because it was already predominantly non-Indian in Indian territory, and that put Congress in a very difficult position of figuring out what to do. And I think that is necessary to understand to figure out what the text of these statutes mean. So I -- I guess my question on demographics is people talk about the demographics now.
The demographics in 1890 were also similar.
How should that affect what we're thinking about? And, more particularly, can you connect that up to the text of the statutes that Congress enacted in that 17-year period to transition to statehood? Certainly, Justice Kavanaugh.
I think that's the right way to look at it. By statehood, 90 percent of the area was non-Indian.
And I think what that means is that you have to figure out what Congress was trying to do, which is abundantly clear from the -- from the history, which is Congress is trying to un -- undo the tribe's exclusive ownership of the land and exclusive governance of the land, because there was no territorial government, to give it to a new state that would both -- that would govern the land of non-Indians and Indians alike and where -- where non-Indians and Indians alike would -- would own the land. That is nothing like any of this Court's previous cases.
Mr. Gershengorn was not able to point to any case that was anything like that.
And so how that connects to the statutes, well, if what Congress is trying to do, and this is very clear from the history, Congress was trying to transform both the jurisdiction and the territory -- and the land ownership.
Well, the Curtis Act transformed jurisdiction.
It said tribal law shall not be in force.
And the -- the -- the allotment agreement transformed the land tenure. Now the other side says, well, we could still levy taxes.
Taxes were affirmatively abolished in the Five Tribes Act, so they can point to no actual tribal power that existed.
The one power they can point to was abolished in the Five Tribes Act. Thank you, counsel. General -- Deputy General Kneedler. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. In preparing the Indian territory for statehood, Congress eliminated all the hallmarks of a reservation.
Congress broke up the tribe's national domain and extinguished the tribe's interest in it.
Congress likewise eliminated the tribe's territorial sovereignty over that area by abolishing tribal courts and prohibiting enforcement of tribal law in territorial courts. At the same time, Congress eliminated the distinct treatment of Indians under federal law and instead subjected all persons in the territory, irrespective of race, to the same courts and body of law largely incorporated from the state law of Arkansas. And Congress carried forward that framework for the new state.
It directed that Oklahoma law would apply throughout the former Indian territory and provided for the transfer of criminal and civil cases involving Indians and non-Indians alike to state court. Congress did not then radically change course and impose a -- a reservation-based jurisdictional regime throughout eastern Oklahoma upon statehood. Mr. Kneedler, the Creek land was owned by the tribe in communal fee, unlike the situation on most reservations.
Could you explain the consequence of that for the analysis in this case? Yeah, I think it's -- I think it's significant and I think it strongly supports disestablishment here. The -- the tribe had fee ownership as part of setting aside the territory for its nation to be undisturbed, and the -- and the treaties provided that no territory or state would be created there. So, after all the non-Indians moved on to the territory, Congress concluded that was untenable and it had to break up the Nation, and that included both the fee and the -- and the sovereignty. And so what -- when Congress provided for allotment, the tribe specifically ceded its interest in the land, conveyed its interest in the land to the individuals.
And because the fee was the hallmark of their sovereignty, what made them separate, the tribe's own conveyance of the fee to individual members and extinguishment of all interest in it extinguished their sovereignty at the same time. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes, thank you. Mr. Kneedler, the -- in Solem and Parker, we had clear reservations, the -- the -- and it was pretty standard, and then you had an effort to dispose of or to alienate surplus land. Here, this is entirely different. Have you seen a case like this in which we have applied the Solem and Parker framework? I -- I have not.
And the point you made earlier that Congress -- in all those earlier cases, the Court was really trying to discern the consequence of a surplus land act standing alone.
Here, you have other statutes that specifically address those consequences. Each of those cases arose in deciding whether federal law would apply or state law would apply.
Here, Congress answered that question directly.
There's no need to infer that from the Surplus Lands Act alone. Congress, in preparation for statehood, provided that the same laws would apply to Indians and non-Indians and then turned over a territory with those attributes to the new state.
And immediately upon statehood, when that compact of statehood was entered into, the state courts started to exercise jurisdiction over -- over Indians in that territory, in fulfillment of Congress's preparation. And that was done pursuant to an act of Congress.
It's not simply a consequence of -- of surplus -- of surplus lands.
All of that is a consequence of Congress's preparation for statehood. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? What about statements that an allotment conveying the title and interest of the tribe, an allotment, unlike cession, doesn't diminish the reservation? There's -- there's no a priori test for that -- for that proposition. The important point here is that when Congress started the move towards statehood, the preparation for statehood, it did that in the Dawes Act in 19 -- in 1893, and that Act provided that -- for the Dawes Commission to negotiate for cession, for allotment, or such other method that -- that could be accomplished in preparation for statehood.
Congress regarded whatever method could be worked out as the prelude to statehood. And the reason for prelude to statehood is because Congress was preparing to substitute the state for a territory, just as it has done with all territories in the past.
The only difference here was that there was no territorial government separately established. It was the territory's and the government's and the tribe's, which Congress essentially prevented from enforcing their laws and created a situation where the land with that characteristic could then be transferred to the state, with Indians and non-Indians treated alike. I -- I think this question has been asked before, but, when the tribe, not the United States, the tribe holds -- holds title to treaty-guaranteed land, you say we should apply a less stringent standard for disestablishment.
Why? I -- I would think that you would anticipate an even stronger showing when it is the tribe itself, not the United States. I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not saying it's a less standard, it's a -- it's a less stringent standard.
What I'm saying is that what Congress did needs to be understood in the historical framework in -- in which it -- in which it acted. And the framework -- that was understood by everybody concerned at the time of statehood.
This -- the -- the compact of statehood that -- that provided for this, it wasn't conferring jurisdiction on a state.
It was part of a compact under which the state came into the union that in eastern Oklahoma, as was prepared for by Congress, Indians and non-Indians were treated alike. That was the deal.
And that was followed through with by transferring cases involving non-Indians.
And the -- the prior -- Justice Breyer? Thank you. If we decide that Solem doesn't apply here or there's an exception, then you would win, I -- I assume.
Let's assume that. But would that not cause the same practical problems elsewhere in the country? For 35 years, people have lived under Solem.
If we change it or make exceptions, won't there be places where people bring lawsuits, people who are in prison, and they say, we were tried in the wrong court? The same circumstances here, we thought we were a tribe, and the prisoner says, no, you're not a tribe and vice versa. So why does the change -- why does the parade of horribles work in only one direction? Departing from Solem, you get the horribles regardless. We -- we think this is a compelling case under Solem but -- but also that the Court has to consider the application of Solem with respect to the unique history of -- of Oklahoma.
There is no other territory of the United States converted to statehood among the -- But that isn't quite my question.
My question is: If we make an exception from Solem or if we change Solem, is there not likely to be the same kind of parade of horribles elsewhere? I don't know the history of every tribe in the United States, and though you know a great deal about it, I'm not sure that you do. But you created a -- And -- I'm sorry. No, go ahead.
You see the point. If you created an exception to Solem, it would be an exception that would no doubt be based on the unique circumstances of this case.
Again, this -- and unlike in Solem and other cases, there's not just a Surplus Lands Act.
You have these other specific statutes directed at the consequences of disestablishment that -- the -- the attributes of disestablishment. And I'm unaware, and we haven't seen in the eight or nine or ten disestablishment cases this Court has had, anything resembling that where there are separate statutes implementing -- Oh, would you know what happened, say, in Alaska or in Hawaii or in Wyoming? Have you all looked into this and said if you create an exception and there's no one else who could qualify for that exception? No one has identified. We -- we -- we have not.
Of course, in Alaska, there are no -- no reservations at all.
In Wyoming, there's one reservation.
So nothing like this has surfaced. And, again, this has been the case for 100 years in Oklahoma, more than 100 years, since Oklahoma entered the Union on the understanding that Indians and non-Indians would be treated alike in the eastern half of that new -- of that new state.
There's -- Justice Alito? -- nothing like that -- Mr. Kneedler, the broad question whether the Creek Nation has a reservation or whether it's a dependent Indian community has all sorts of implications, but what I'd like you to address is whether we can decide this case on a narrow ground because, after all, the only thing that's involved here is a criminal prosecution. So, if we were to look at the narrow question whether Congress has provided for the trial of cases like this one in state court, what would an opinion like that look like? What would it look to, the 1897 Act, the 1906 Enabling Act and the amendment in 1907, the way these laws have been interpreted for 100 years? What would an opinion like that -- I think it would -- -- look like? I think it would look at all those things.
And, again, what happened prior to statehood is highly relevant because all -- everything Congress did was in preparation for statehood.
So the limit -- so subjecting Indians and non-Indians to the same laws was part of the package that Congress incorporated into the new state at statehood, so the 1897 and 1904 Acts are -- are critical, and the Statehood Act, which provided for the transfer of cases to state jurisdiction, was contemporaneously construed and applied by those responsible for implementing it. Well, what would you say to the argument that we shouldn't look to the way it was interpreted right after statehood or for many decades after that because those people were proceeding in bad faith, the statutes were clear, and they and the state was simply usurping authority, and the federal government was going along with it? There's absolutely no basis for that.
The -- these are federal judges, federal district judges, federal Indian court judges, and state court judges and -- and state court prosecutors.
Everybody on the ground understood that. There was the case in this Court called Hendrix, which proceeded on the assumption that an Indian in the Indian territory had committed a crime.
This case could have been transferred to state court. There was some special statute that said otherwise, but the premise of the whole case was that his case would have otherwise gone to state court in Oklahoma. And the -- it's important to understand that the tribe understood that.
And I urge the Court to look at the statements by the principal chief of the -- of the Creek Nation in 1906, after the -- the Five Tribes Act was passed, and he said: Upon the establishment of a state government, all powers over the governing, even of our landed property, will cease, except insofar as the distribution of our property and money is concerned, which will be entirely under -- Justice -- Justice Sotomayor? Mr. Kneedler, I understood that statement was in light of the existing congressional disestablishment legislation that Congress subsequently changed and didn't go through with.
But putting that aside, I -- I haven't figured out whether you've accepted the -- Oklahoma's suggestion about the dependent Indian community exception or argument. Are you endorsing that argument? No.
Not -- not -- not in terms, we're not.
I mean, this Court has -- has discussed dependent Indian community separately.
But some of what informs the State's argument we think is very important, as I said before, that the -- the State -- But disestablishment -- but let's go back to, is there a consequence that we're unaware of? If we were to describe this reservation -- this Creek land as dependent Indian community -- I -- -- what other things would we put in question, what -- what -- I -- You're saying the things that inform that discussion inform your disestablishment and -- I understand your argument, but why aren't you endorsing the dependent Indian community argument? Well, there could be other situations.
I mean, for example, in -- in Oklahoma, Congress has provided for various statutes to apply to tribes within their former reservations.
And if these were regarded as dependent Indian communities, would statutes like that apply? Now Congress still referred to them as former reservations. But one -- one point that I think is -- that makes this -- Mr. Kneedler, I hate to cut you off, but I do have one last question here. Sure. Which is what do we do with -- if we say this reservation was disestablished, under what theory would we recognize Indian sovereignty over lands they kept? It was either disestablished or not. And why -- Well -- -- would all the complex laws that exist now giving the Indians the reservation -- the casino rights and jurisdiction over lands that they own and -- and all of those other things, what would be the basis of keeping all of that -- Well, it would be -- -- if we held it was disenfranchised? It's commonplace that when a reservation is disestablished, those parcels that remain in -- as allotments or tribal trust land or -- or of the sort remain Indian Country. And so saying the reservation was disestablished, which has been the assumption for over 100 years, would not change anything on the ground because the -- and -- and Oklahoma has always been understood where allotment -- allotments are the fulcrum of tribal and individual activities.
And this -- Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Justice Kagan? Mr. Kneedler, I understand you want to support Oklahoma's position in this case, but just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's questions about what Indian -- what dependent Indian communities were or were thought to be in 1935, do you think that those concepts were mutually exclusive, a reservation and a dependent Indian community? No, I think there was a lot of overlap and that, you know, sort of the bottom -- Congress -- the Court often described them in general terms as land validly set apart for the use of Indians as such under the superintendence of the government.
And that -- that phrase appeared in -- in Potawatomie in describing is there a difference between trusts and -- and reservations. So that the same general concept was there, except for a reservation, as opposed to an allotment, for example, it's -- it's owned collectively.
And so, when the land is broken up, as it was here, particularly when it's broken -- when it's fee land that is broken up and when someone conveys their interest in fee to -- to somebody else, they are conveying all of their interest in it.
It's not like trust property on the typical reservation where the -- where, when it's allotted, the United States retains an interest and, therefore, on behalf of the tribe in some sense, retains an interest. When it's fee land, it is conveyed out of the tribe and the tribe loses all of its interest in the land.
And that's particularly clear under this allotment agreement because it provides that the United States also extinguished -- by approving the deeds, extinguished its interest in the land.
And that interest was a reversionary interest for when the tribe was disappearing. And so, by -- by relinquishing the United States' interest in that land at the same time it was conveyed to the individual allottee, it made it clear that the tribe as sovereign was being -- its sovereign authority over that land was being eliminated. Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Justice Gorsuch? Mr. Kneedler, tell me what's wrong with this sequence of -- of -- of -- of my understanding, that Congress did establish something it called a reservation with respect to this property at some point in time, that through the 1890s and the early part of the last century, there was an awful lot of debate about how to -- how to end that reservation, whether they could end it in anticipation of Oklahoma becoming part of the Union. And that things got very complicated and they came mighty close to ending the reservation but never quite passed the kind of language that we typically see when that happens, reversion of all lands to the public domain or cessation or anything like that. In fact, the Dawes Commission couldn't -- admitted it couldn't quite get there.
And so you're really left to rely mostly on a lot of demographic evidence, both then and now, which, while not everybody's acting in good faith, not everybody -- not everybody's acting in bad faith too, as someone pointed out. And it's a mixed bag.
And it's very hard to make much of it.
And to rely too heavily on demographic evidence is dangerous because you in some -- in some ways incentivize people to ignore the plain terms of the law. And, for example, as I pointed out earlier, I think it was until the 1970s that Oklahoma continued to try and enforce state law against Native Americans on allotted territory. I believe I have that right. So tell me what's wrong with that understanding, please. Well, first of all, I think there's a big difference between demographics before and after statehood.
The -- the overwhelming presence of non-Indians in the territory was precisely the reason why Congress said it won't work to have tribal governments running this and tribes couldn't emphasize jurisdiction over the non-Indians. And what Congress said is, this area needs a government for and by both Indians and non-Indians, and it established that in the territory so that it could hand that arrangement over to the new state. And it was contest -- this Court's decisions say that the contemporaneous understanding of what Congress was doing is significant.
The original public meaning of what -- what was done, and everybody, the state understood it, the state -- or the -- the state obviously implemented its compact of statehood, the federal government understood it.
Delix Cohen understood it.
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs at the time said there's only a shell of the government -- of the tribal government left. The tribal chairman -- the tribal chief said the same thing, that all we are in a position to do is distribute the property. And that -- that is -- and even the case that Petitioners and -- and the tribe rely upon, the Harjo versus Kleppe, specifically says that the tribe lost its territorial sovereignty even though it had the authority to run its internal affairs.
So -- Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Kneedler. Good morning. I want to follow up on a question Justice Sotomayor asked and one Justice Gorsuch asked. Justice Sotomayor mentioned quite rightly the 1832 and 1833 treaties.
My understanding, however, was that the 1866 treaty made clear that those treaty rights were, I don't know if the word is superseded, but diminished because the tribes had aligned and made a treaty with the confederates -- Confederate States of America, and the treaty language in 1866 said that that had unsettled the treaty relations. Anything you want to add on the 1866 treaty, the relevance of that? Yeah, I -- I don't think it adds significantly to the point, except that it -- it reflected an assertion of a greater federal responsibility in the territory. And it was contemplated that Congress could pass laws governing the territory. I did want to make one point about practical consequences on the criminal side. Not only would -- would this jeopardize all the prior convictions on the state side, but it would impose great burdens on the federal government.
It's estimated a 1300 percent increase in criminal prosecutions brought in state court. And then, of course, for the state, there -- there would be questions of taxation and whatnot.
And -- and I don't think City of Sherrill, which has been suggested, is a solution to that. Can I ask one other question, Mr. Kneedler, to follow up on Justice Gorsuch. My understanding given the demographics as of 1890 was that it would be very hard to have a tribal government over the whole territory because of the population at the time. And my question is: What tribal authority, judicial authority, or legislative authority to your knowledge was exercised over the whole territory, including the white settlers, in 1890 through 1907? It -- it was that the tribes had no authority over the white settlers, which is why Congress put in place the -- the courts for the Indian territory and it put in place federal law, mostly incorporating Arkansas law, to govern Indians and non-Indians alike. And that is the regime that Congress passed on from the territory to the new state and the new state received and has been faithfully applying that ever since statehood. And -- Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Gershengorn, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
A number of things. Justice Gorsuch, first, you're exactly right.
This Court may not be able to determine which party had the better reading of events on the ground 120 years ago, but it is surely well-positioned to determine which party has a better reading of the text.
And on that score, I submit this case is not close. Second, Justice Ginsburg, two points. With respect to fee title, that was meant to be an additional protection because everyone understood the -- the imperfections in Indian title.
The Creek didn't even get their patent until 1852, 20 years after the reservation was -- was given.
Elimination of fee title does not eliminate treaty promises.
Those have to be disestablished through plain text. In addition, Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly right, the right, title, and interest language, which is the only text the other side can point to, conveys only proprietary interest, not sovereign interest, and so there is no textual transfer. There has been a lot of talk -- discussion this morning about irrespective of race.
It is -- one quick point on that. When Congress -- when -- in the Enabling Act in Section 13, what Congress put in place was the laws of the territory of Oklahoma, which did not have the supposedly magic language about ""irrespective of race."" That suggests that Congress well understood that the arguments the SG and Oklahoma are making on this score are -- are made up for today. Fourth, there was a lot of discussion about whether there's a compromise available on criminal jurisdiction.
There is not.
Justice Alito listed a number of factors for Mr. Kneedler.
One of the missing ones was the text. The text is very clear.
I was amazed that Mr. Kneedler said there was no basis for believing that there was -- ignoring the text. Nagonset said that is true.
Secretary Udall's memo listed seven states in which it were true. Finally, the numbers today are mind-boggling in the back of the envelope.
They don't appear in any of the briefs.
The only fixed number is 178 petitions.
That dwarfs Ramos. I understand the Court's concerns about jurisdictional consequences, but there are no serious disagreements that these disputes are common in Indian Country -- Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1109, McKinney versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State seeks to put James McKinney to death even though he's never once had a sentencing proceeding that complies with current law.
There are two separate paths for McKinney to win.
The path in question 1 argues that the Arizona Supreme Court reopened McKinney's sentencing proceeding.
The Ninth Circuit had earlier granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus and gave the State the option of either imposing a life sentence or seeking the death penalty again. The State chose the latter, which required brand new state action in the form of new sentencing.
The Arizona Supreme Court then did everything itself just as it had in 1996. That was wrong.
This Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst required a jury sentencing.
If McKinney were sentenced today, no one doubts he'd be entitled to a jury trial. The State claims this would open the floodgates.
But McKinney is not seeking to use Ring retroactively as a sword to challenge his earlier proceedings.
Rather, he's saying that when the State conducts a new proceeding, that sentencing must comply with current law. Otherwise, the implications would be frightening.
For example, a state could run a re-sentencing today in 2019 with a pre-Batson jury, with race-based jury strikes.
That can't be right. And the second path, set out in question 2, is for this Court to simply say that the Eddings violation in this case requires a remand to the trial court for sentencing and that the appellate court was wrong to perform that delicate task itself.
This breaks no new ground.
Indeed, this Court has, on five separate occasions since the 1982 Eddings decision, ordered resentencing for Eddings violations. Both paths get McKinney to the same destination, but they are separate.
Question 2 is limited to the small universe of Eddings violations and how to fix them.
And question 1, by contrast, is about when sentencing proceedings lose their finality and are reopened. I'm fine waiving the rest of my time if there are questions. Well, what -- what about Clemons? Because Clemons is a precedent of this Court that says that the appellate court can do reweighing.
Is that still good law? So we're on question 2. And -- Yes. -- and with respect to question 2, Clemons is not an Eddings case at all.
Clemons is a case about whether or not an aggravating circumstance can be subtracted from -- in a re -- in a resentencing proceeding. That's a much easier case than what the -- Right.
You say in your brief, erroneously including an invalid aggravating circumstance is fundamentally different from erroneously excluding a relevant mitigating circumstance.
Why? I don't understand that. Because what the Arizona Supreme Court task had to deal with here was a full-blown reweighing of everything, mitigating and aggravating circumstances, whereas subtracting one element is very different. And, indeed, we know this from Clemons itself, Justice Kavanaugh, because the very end of Clemons actually brackets this case.
It says, in a circumstance in which the -- there -- in which the appellate court is asked for the first time to weigh and determine evidence, that's different.
And what case do they cite there? They cite this Court's decision in Caldwell. And in Caldwell, there's language after language saying appellate courts are ill suited to making these determinations about a defendant and whether mercy should be given. They want to see the defendant in person. That's a lot of the argument that Justice Blackmun raised in dissent in Clemons, of course, that the appellate court wasn't well suited to do this, that this was really a mistake. Correct.
And our point to you is twofold.
Number one, you can just take Clemons as existing law.
I do think it's -- my second point is it's undercut by Ring and Hurst, but just it may be existing law, but it's only existing law with respect to the subtraction of one aggravating circumstance, and Clemons itself, as I say, brackets this. And then the second thing is -- is this Court, I think, has really changed the rules since Clemons because of Ring and Hurst. And we're not saying that Ring and Hurst overrule Clemons.
That's not our position.
But just that I don't think it should be extended any further than its facts and that's what -- Mr. Katyal -- Let me give you a -- -- the -- the court below only reached your first issue, whether this was a new proceeding or not.
It didn't reach the second.
If it had, what does it have to do? Shouldn't we be remanding for that second question? We -- You -- you have presumed that it would have to do Ring, but my colleague, Justice Kavanaugh, has raised a question of why not.
Shouldn't we be letting that be aired below? Shouldn't we just reach the first question and leave the second open and let it be completely aired? I mean, there is at least one Arizona case, Styles, where the court, following Clemons, basically said it's only the appellate process that was at issue in the decision below; we can redo the appellate process without applying Ring and Hurst. I don't know if it would choose to do that again with new argument, but shouldn't we give it an opportunity to do that? Justice Sotomayor, I don't think you have to here.
I mean, either way, whether you viewed question 2 or question 1, the result would be a jury trial because Arizona law -- Well, that's your argument.
I'm just saying, shouldn't we let the appellate court make that decision? Well, I think the appellate court here has pronounced on question 1 and said effect -- No, if we disavow it over that pronouncement.
I -- I take your argument, as I did in your brief, that finality is not up to the state court or reopening -- finality is not up to the state court, that it's up to federal law.
We have to define it for everybody. And if we told it to go through a new procedure, I don't know how that can't be a reopening.
We told it -- the only thing they say we said, and I take your argument is broader than that, but assuming I accept their position that what they were told to do was to reopen the appellate process, then they were wrong. So, Justice Sotomayor -- And we -- that -- that's your argument, right? Absolutely.
Justice Sotomayor -- That it was a new proceeding.
So now shouldn't we remand it for them to decide what new law they apply, if any? Or what law -- If you want to rule for us on question 1, we're obviously not going to be opposed to that.
I don't think you have to rule on question 1 and not reach question 2 because the Arizona Supreme Court here did make a decision on question 2. Indeed, there was a whole dispute between us about what should the Arizona Supreme Court do, and briefs were filed.
There's Joint Appendix pages 385 to 89.
You have the State's brief on this saying: Do this in the Arizona Supreme Court. And what we said is no, Eddings requires, under Caldwell, Clemons, all of those cases, a resentencing -- But they decided the question on a narrow ground that this was not a new procedure.
If we disavow them -- that this was not a reopening.
If we disavow their belief of that, then shouldn't we get an answer to the question they left open? I'm not sure that they left it open, Your Honor.
What they did was arrogate to themselves the power to conduct this resentencing proceeding -- Well, at what stage of the -- of the direct appeal was there an error according to the Ninth Circuit? The -- there was an error -- if we're talking about -- there was an error both at the trial court and at the Arizona Supreme Court. But the Arizona Supreme Court conducted de novo review -- Correct. -- was it not? So wasn't the error identified by the Ninth Circuit an error committed by the Arizona Supreme Court? And more.
So there's four answers here, Justice Alito.
First, I know my friend has made this argument in the red brief at page 38 that this is the Arizona Supreme Court's error only.
That's not the argument in the brief in opposition.
And I'm not sure 15.2 allows them to make the argument when it wasn't in the brief in opposition.
And that's particularly true here because they told you in this -- 2016, when they filed a cert petition from the Ninth Circuit, at page 30, they said that the error was actually in the trial court. All right.
Well, I mean, put -- put aside these preservation issues, which we can sort out for -- for ourselves. If the Arizona Supreme Court in the decision on direct appeal had made it clear, if it did not already, but assuming that the Ninth Circuit majority was right, if they -- if they had made it clear that they were taking into account the mitigation evidence, irrespective of whether there was a causal connection with the commission of the offense, would there have been an error? If there were no trial court error on Eddings, we wouldn't be here. Our position is -- What if there was -- all right.
Assume there was a trial court error, but the Ninth Circuit said we're conducting de novo review, and we're going to do it the right way, and we take the mitigation evidence into account in the way that Eddings allow -- requires us to do. And I don't think this Court's precedents allow the appellate court to fix the trial court error.
Decisions like Caldwell say that that's a decision for the sentencer at the trial court where they can see the defendant, confront the witnesses.
And in cases like Arizona, there's a double circuit breaker function served by the scheme because they have to win both no death sentence -- they have to win a death sentence both at the trial court and at the Arizona Supreme Court. And what they're seeking to do here is fuse that into one thing.
Just as long as it can be fixed on appeal, that's enough.
And what decisions like Caldwell say is, uh-uh, for juries -- sorry, for Cald -- for Eddings errors, you need to have a trial court consideration of that. Why -- maybe I must have the facts wrong, but -- maybe.
But, look, there are -- the trial court says, a long time ago, there are two aggravating factors, A and B. And then it looks at the mitigation, and the mitigation is he had a terrible childhood.
And the trial court says, well, that only counts if it's causally connected.
That's a mistake. Then it goes to Arizona Supreme Court, and they say the same thing.
They say one and two, aggravating, and now we independently say this causal thing. Yeah. You're wrong about the causal, says the Ninth Circuit.
Back to the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court says we will redo our reweighing.
We will now not use causal. Why does it have to go back to the -- if their law really is -- if it really is the Supreme Court can do this way, why does it have to go back to the trial court? Because, in Eddings cases and in particularly Caldwell, this Court has said the trial court has to confront all this in the first place. At page 331, for example, you said: Whatever intangibles a jury might consider in its sentencing determination, few can be gleaned from an appellate record.
The mercy plea is made directly to the sentencer.
There is no appellate mercy -- Well, in Arizona, the sentencer is the appellate court.
You could say there's something wrong with that.
It does say the sentencer is the appellate court. And what this Court's decisions -- Can't do that -- -- from Eddings on have said, no, you've got to remand to the trial court for a determination and not to the appellate court.
And, by the way -- Okay.
I -- I got that point. And, Justice Breyer, in Arizona, State versus Bible says appellate courts can't take evidence and can't assess that kind of stuff.
They're not institutionally equipped to do that. All right.
Okay. But we don't have to send it back because of Ring.
Is that true? I mean, Ring, if it's now current law that applies, can they do this.
Can they say, yes, it applies, correct, correct, but not to the aggravating part because the aggravating part was done correctly under old law -- So -- -- and that's not what's at issue.
Only the mitigating part is at issue. So our -- Can they say that? -- position on question 1 -- Yeah. -- is that they've conducted a brand new sentencing proceeding and, therefore, current law applies.
That means Ring applies.
And Ring -- Well, Ring would make you say that. And they haven't really gotten into, except for just saying, oh, there's no Ring violation, what the possible violations are. Our brief at pages 30 to 34 does outline that -- Counsel, why -- -- and says, you know, the weighing and the mitigating circumstance and the taking of an aggravating circumstance without a jury determination, any of those are separate Ring problems. So, on question 1, why would Ring apply? I mean, I guess the -- the issue is, is the defendant getting a kind of windfall if Ring applies? The error here has nothing to do with Ring.
And Ring only comes into the picture because the -- the court is trying to create -- is trying to correct a different error. Why is it that, you know, a -- a non-retroactive rule should all of a sudden pop up and the defendant get the benefit of that rule? We -- we don't think that there's a windfall here, and I'll explain why, but, if you do, that would just push you in the direction of question 2, in which you don't have that feature. But, with respect to a windfall, I don't think that exists here. All our argument is, is that the State is conducting a brand new proceeding, and that new proceeding has to comply with current law. So we're not trying -- trying to use the flaw, the Eddings flaw, to reopen old grievances and say, oh, there was this problem in the trial or that problem in the trial.
It's just the -- the fact after the Ninth Circuit granted the conditional writ, the State affirmatively, you need a brand new state action in order to sentence McKinney to death. And our problem is with that brand new action, not with something that happened back before in 1993 -- You're requiring -- -- but with what happened later. -- you're requiring a new jury sentencing 28 years after the murders and after the victims' families have been through this for three decades.
And that's not required by Clemons, I take your point on that, but the whole point of Clemons -- and I -- I understand your argument -- was the appellate court can do this. And there was a passionate dissent, you've read it, by Justice Blackmun saying this was really quite wrong to allow the appellate court to do this. But the Arizona Supreme Court, presumably aware of that law, did it itself. And why -- why go back to a jury resentencing 28 years later? Justice Kavanaugh, I think in many of the Eddings cases you've done exactly that.
In cases in which there's a doubt as to whether or not the jury consider -- or the trial court considered mitigating evidence, you've sent it back to the trial court for a resentencing and, indeed, for a jury determination. You did it in Eddings itself.
You did it in Penry.
You did it in Mills.
Case after case, that is the result of this Court's precedents. And I think it's right because we're not talking about some technical violation here or something.
We're talking about the heart of what capital punishment sentencing is all about, the weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Well, that was true in Clemons, correct? Correct.
And, again, but in Clemons, it was just the subtraction of that one factor. I know. And, indeed, they bracketed that. But the big point of the dissent in Clemons was, look, this is something a fact finder should do, the jury -- the fact finder, the trial court should do, which is hear all the evidence and do that weighing. Right. And that seems quite similar, and I still take your point, but quite similar. Right.
I -- I think it's still different because it's just a much more limited question on appeal in that circumstance. Here, you are asking -- and Arizona has a de novo, brand new, you know, full reweighing procedure -- you're asking them in that circumstance to -- to -- to decide something that a jury has never seen or a trial court's never seen. And, you know, cases like Caldwell say, for mitigating evidence, mercy is really important.
And, you know, to have the appellate court decide this really fundamental question without even having the defendant before it, without having the witnesses, you know, that's -- that's something, I think, that's new. At least in Cald -- at least in Clemons -- I should have said this, Justice Kavanaugh -- at least in Clemons, there was a trial court determination at some point of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances. But the problem -- Why are you really -- why are you not asking for a windfall? Indeed, maybe a double windfall.
You are effectively getting retroactive application of Ring, which is not retroactively applicable to anybody else. And not only that, what you really want, I gather, is a jury -- is -- is not the correction of a Ring error.
It is the -- it is another shot at convincing a jury to hold that somebody who is going to be found death-eligible in all likelihood should, nevertheless, not get the death penalty. So it's a limited correction to -- because the Ninth Circuit's invalidated this -- this sentence.
So it requires a new sentencing if they want the death penalty. It doesn't allow us to, for a windfall, for example, reopen guilt or innocence or anything like that.
That was not touched by it.
So it's limited to that.
And in that sense, Justice -- Justice Alito, it's kind of like when the Court decides an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a capital case. Yes, in one sense, I guess it's a windfall because lots of issues are reopened there, not just one. But that is, I think, the result of a precedent that says, hey, you need a full resentencing. Well, but, I mean, there the ineffective assistance of counsel can have all kinds of effects.
I mean, you have a very -- you have an entirely formalistic argument, and maybe it's right, but why don't you just admit it's entirely formalistic.
You want a retroactive -- you want effectively a retroactive application of Ring and your real beef is not with a -- the -- the lack of a jury finding on -- on -- on eligibility.
It's with the actual sentence that the jury decided to impose. I -- I couldn't disagree more profoundly with that.
That is, that what we're not seeking here is not formalistic; what we're saying is that there is new state action as a result of the Ninth Circuit's decision. We're not saying Ring allows you to reopen, for example, the jury trial rights on guilt and innocence or anything like that. It's simply that they need it to come in and have affirmative state action.
If they wanted to have a death sentence, if they wanted to have a final judgment, they needed to come in and do a new proceeding -- Mr. Katyal -- -- in 2016.
And our problem is with the new 2016 proceeding. At the risk of a formalistic question, normally, states are the definers of their own procedures, their own state law.
And I would have thought that, normally at least, a state gets to define when its proceedings are final, for state law purposes at least. What federal law and what standard of review would apply to determine whether that state law violates the federal Constitution? So, Justice Gorsuch, two big answers here.
One is we're not in that circumstance because Arizona borrows from federal law.
There's no state law -- But let's -- let's just say we are, okay? Let -- let -- stick with my hypothetical if you don't mind. Sure.
Okay.
And with respect to your hypothetical, I think this Court has said from Richfield Oil on in 1946 that it is -- it is a federal question, not a state question.
In cases like Gonzalez, you've said you don't want to have state-by-state definitions -- I -- I accept -- -- of finality. -- that there could be a federal rule of decision for vindicating some federal constitutional principle, but what would be that federal constitutional principle? And wouldn't, whatever it is -- you're going to say due process or equal protection -- I -- I'm looking forward to that.
But whatever it is, I would have thought that it would have been a pretty deferential standard of review by this Court to -- to maybe assess whether there are efforts to evade a federal interest. I think this Court has said that the -- that -- that it is purely a federal question and hasn't deferred in all of these different cases. Is it federal common law? I mean, I'm -- what's your source of law? I think -- it's Article III in the Supremacy Clause because -- Well, the Supremacy Clause vindicates -- Exactly, but -- -- other -- Right, but if I could -- -- federal laws. Right. And so I'm -- I'm still waiting for what that other federal law is. It is that, if you allow state-by-state definitions of finality, allow them to define around the problem, then you have, for example, Batson problems and a return to the Linkletter world where Justice Harlan was so worried about the idea that you could just pick and choose when a state could apply current law and when they could say, oh, no, it's much more -- Right.
I give up on that one.
How about the standard of review? So we -- you know, we don't have a beef really with the standard of review.
I don't think this Court has ever given any deference.
But even if you were to give deference in this case, you'd be giving deference to actually a state using a federal definition because they never cite -- the Arizona Supreme Court when they say -- Well, they say -- -- this is a final -- -- it's an independent procedure and that that's different -- Citing -- -- in Arizona, and it's kind of an unusual procedure. No, no, no.
They cite, Justice Gorsuch, this Court's decision in Griffith and federal law entirely through and through.
There is no cite to anything in Arizona. All right.
Well, let's -- Michigan versus Long. Just suppose I disagree with you on that for a moment. Uh-huh. You still want to win, right? So what standard of review would you have this Court apply in these circumstances? Well, we would say -- Something stronger than rational basis review? We -- we would say that it doesn't -- that there is no reason for it to be deferential because you are talking about federal constitutional commands.
So you would just apply, you know, a de novo standard.
But, even if you wanted deferential, rational basis -- Right. -- whatever it is, here, this is met.
Here, they are having a brand-new sentencing proceeding, the heart of what capital sentencing is all about -- Mr. Katyal -- -- weighing the -- -- in a lot of your -- your argument, you've talked -- you've talked about ineffective assistance examples, Batson examples, but not every violation of federal law cuts across the entire proceeding, as ineffective assistance or Batson. Correct. Do you have a line to draw between those that do and those that don't? Our -- our line, Mr. Chief Justice, is -- is, if the new proceeding violates current law, in that circumstance and in that circumstance only is there a constitutional -- our argument is limited to that.
So you can be -- So there's no difference between sort of a surgical mistake that could be corrected and an entirely comprehensive mistake that infects the whole proceeding? No.
That's a separate kind of safeguard against their open-the-floodgates argument, because, as Justice Sotomayor, when she was on the Second Circuit, said in Burrell and many other courts, like the Florida Supreme Court, have said, if it's just a technical correction, if it's ministerial, then you're not reopening the final judgment. We absolutely agree with that.
This is the polar opposite. Well, but somewhere between ministerial and entirely comprehensive, there are things that are discrete and focused -- Yes. -- that suggest that a -- the -- the new -- new proceeding, to give you the benefit of that, is not one that can't be -- is one that can be cured relatively easily. Right, and our point, the line is -- and this is what Burrell and other cases say -- if the new proceeding requires an exercise of discretion, then current law applies to that new proceeding.
And, yes, you know, I agree, you know, that there can be difficult cases in the middle, but this is the outlier. This is a brand-new, full-blown, 100 percent redo -- Can I -- -- of what happened in 1996. So the part of Clemons that you say may still be good law, suppose that the appellate reweighing occurred not on direct review but on state habeas in the state supreme court.
Is that a possibility in your view? So we don't think anything turns on the label state habeas or direct review or anything.
It's fundamentally a substantive question, what's going on.
And if -- Could -- could they do that, though, the Clemons reweighing, in -- in the state habeas proceeding? If -- if they did the same thing here but called it collateral or habeas, it would make no difference whatsoever because, ultimately -- So I think your answer is no, they couldn't do that. It's ultimately a substantive test. And why -- why not? Why can't a state do it in that fashion? Because then you'd give the state the power to relabel something collateral and evade Batson and things like that.
And that's a return to Linkletter and allowing different and dis- -- disuniformity between cases.
And that's fundamentally what I think the -- this Court's finality jurisprudence in Jimenez is all about trying to avoid. I reserve. Thank you, counsel. General Skinner. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I believe there's actually only one path forward here for Petitioner.
Effectively, QP 1 resolves the resolution of this case no matter which way it goes.
If there's retroactive application of Ring and Hurst and all current law applies, Arizona does not contend that we have Ring-compliant aggravators here, and this would be a case that we would take back to the trial court. To the extent that there is no retroactive application, Clemons is the governing law, and what Arizona did fits entirely within Clemons.
All of the cases involving trial court remands under Eddings from this Court the Petitioner has cited predate Clemons.
Caldwell predates Clemons.
All of them do. And there is no difference -- to pick up on something that Justice Kavanaugh mentioned, we don't believe that where the record is built, which is critical here, where the record is built, credibility determinations have been made, the expert for the defendant has been credited in the trial court over the State's expert, that there would be any problem with the trial -- with the appeals court conducting its own independent review. Caldwell and these cases discuss some sort of new evidence that was never heard.
And counsel keeps mentioning things as if never seen, the evidence was never seen, the evidence has never been heard.
But the PTSD expert testimony was credited.
The existence of PTSD has been credited.
These are determinations that have been made, and the only allegation coming out of the Ninth Circuit is that there was an error of law in how those facts and evidence were treated. Turning to Question Presented 1, the language of the writ that was issued is critical here.
It is a conditional writ that does not require vacating the sentence.
The parade of horribles that comes forward out of Petitioner and amici really turns on the idea that somehow a state could -- could -- all of them are answered by the idea that we admit, if a sentence is vacated, that undoes the final judgment in a criminal case.
That is the touchstone of what a criminal case is. Petitioner keeps mentioning that he doesn't want to challenge anything earlier in the case, but yet he cites cases in which this Court has held that the sentence is the judgment and that if you undo the sentence, then you undo the finality. So, if the Court had done this proceeding -- it says it's not a reopening of the judgment, but, if it had done this proceeding and changed its mind and said, you know, it wasn't causally connected and we were following our old rule, but it was fairly powerful evidence and we think he shouldn't be subjected to death, could they, unless they reopen the judgment, have modified the judgment? They can -- they can modify the judgment in the same manner that a 2255 court can modify a judgment, which, you know, even in -- How? You have to open it to modify it, don't you? You have to undo it to change it.
I've never heard of changing a judgment by not undoing it first. There are -- Petitioner cites, for example, the Burrell case out of the Second Circuit, and that's an example where this Court has recognized that even in the context of a direct appeal, where you are making a change and it's the only change that can be made, and, here, there's only two sentences available, we believe that if the Arizona Supreme Court had decided that the mitigation was sufficiently substantial -- But it -- it used a well-known exception in the law, a ministerial exception, and defined ministerial as being -- since I wrote it, I know what I said -- it defined ministerial as being with no discretion. You know, you enter the wrong date or you accidentally enter the wrong amount. If you had no choice but to enter X as opposed to Y, that's ministerial.
But I've never heard of changing a judgment that's substantive unless you've reopened a proceeding. The 2255 context has cases that discuss -- a 2255 court is tasked with correcting a sentence and may well correct a sentence in connection with a collateral proceeding. But that supersedes the old one, right? We agree that it would supersede.
I don't know that it -- All right.
So let -- let's go to the ultimate question.
You can't -- if something can be modified, if a judgment can be modified, it seems like more than semantics to say I didn't reopen it for reconsideration.
You can't reconsider what I won't change. That -- that standard would change 2255 proceedings into direct proceedings for purposes of retroactivity.
In a 2255 proceeding, a sentence can be modified. And yet this Court has been very clear that a 2255 proceeding doesn't include application of current law.
It is -- retroactive rules aren't applicable.
So this is a -- this is a -- an aspect that requires balancing the technical and the reality, but it is pretty clear that in charting a modern retroactivity -- Could you go to my other question? It'll be my last of you. Assuming that we say that this was a reopening of the appellate procedure, do you lose automatically? To the extent that this is a reopening of the direct appeal, we believe -- Of the direct appeal. Of the direct appeal, then we would be back on direct appeal, and the Court would be overturning the State's conclusion about the nature of the proceedings, but that would place us into the realm of what this Court discussed potentially in Jimenez.
So -- but that would require looking past what the State has said about its own proceedings and even, as this Court has said in cases like Wall, the entire definition of what is collateral is a judicial reexamination of something. But -- but, General Skinner, the Ninth Circuit found that the Arizona Supreme Court erred on direct review of the trial court judgment.
If they made an error on direct review, how can that error be cured without reopening the direct review? And they said you did the direct review wrong, do the direct review over.
I think that one of the -- was it Justice Hurwitz who said it was a do over? It was a do over of direct review.
There was nothing collateral about it.
It was -- there was an error on direct review, so we sent it back for a new direct review. Two examples that come to mind, Justice Ginsburg, of where a collateral proceeding can resolve a constitutional violation.
Here, for example, to the extent that the Ninth Circuit en banc engaged in harmless error analysis as to the Eddings error, we recognize that they did not hold it to be harmless, but, to the extent that they did that, if they had reached the opposite conclusion, that is a resolution, it's an identification of a constitutional violation and a resolution of that violation in an entirely collateral proceeding. Similarly, when there's appellate ineffective assistance of counsel brought up in a collateral proceeding, the second -- I don't understand how it's collateral when the Ninth Circuit said you erred not in a collateral proceeding, you erred in direct review, so do direct review over. So they didn't say do direct review over, but my point was that the Ninth Circuit, in engaging in harmless error analysis, is itself attempting to resolve a constitutional violation in a collateral proceeding. The Ninth Circuit is sitting in habeas.
It's not a direct proceeding.
They've identified an error in the direct proceedings, but they are demonstrating that in certain circumstances this Court and other courts will -- Well, just on the same line, General, I mean, yes, it's a federal habeas proceeding, but federal habeas courts only have authority over state direct proceedings.
They don't have authority over state collateral proceedings. They were reviewing a state direct appeal, and they said the sentencing was not done right.
You have to do the sentencing again.
So which sentencing are we talking about? We're talking about the sentencing in the state direct appeal. So whatever you call it, you know, people have talked about formalism, whatever you call it, you're redoing, aren't you, the state direct appeal sentencing? So there's a couple responses to that.
The first one I would point out is to the extent that the Ninth Circuit believed that a new direct proceeding had to be engaged in, and the state instead engaged in a more narrow -- which I will get to -- and collateral proceeding, the answer wouldn't be that that proceeding has now become direct for purposes of retroactivity. The answer would be, just as occurred in the Styers case, for Petitioner to return to the habeas court and say the conditional habeas writ was not complied with.
You asked them to do X, and they only did Y, which is inadequate. It doesn't change the nature of the proceeding in the -- The Ninth Circuit allowed that, right? The Ninth Circuit allowed that, exactly, in Styers.
Petitioner in Styers returned.
The District of Arizona, the Ninth Circuit both said this is a valid correction.
This is not something that we believe contravenes the conditional writ.
And that was in 2011.
And Arizona followed the exact procedure here. Well, you're -- you've mentioned the language of the writ several times.
Under your approach, I suppose that would be a focus of litigation, exactly what the language of the writ was going to be? Indeed it was in Styers. Petitioner returned to the District of Arizona and said you said these words in your conditional writ -- the exact words here, I might add -- and that was inadequate to satisfy the writ, and so I need to have an unconditional writ granted. And that is exactly -- if there is a concern that the Ninth Circuit demanded -- But just -- sorry to interrupt.
But, to be clear, and then the -- that went to the Ninth Circuit, right? Correct, and it was affirmed. And the Ninth Circuit said that it was not a violation of the conditional writ? Correct.
Correct.
So that is -- that, again, just goes to if there is a concern about correcting a direct -- an error that occurred in the direct appeals process through the collateral process, first, the existence of harmless error analysis for questions like Eddings in the habeas court acknowledges that there is some resolution and ineffective assistance in the Strickland prejudice prong.
So that's -- Sorry, so are you arguing that we should DIG this case, that we granted cert when we shouldn't have, that they should have done what they did in Styers and gone back to the Ninth Circuit to find out if there was a violation first and that we shouldn't be deciding that ourselves? The Court certainly is in a position to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.
I should note that by granting cert here, the Court has jurisdiction over post-collateral -- post-conviction proceedings, but I do believe that that is an inherent problem here. Well, I think that is at a basis for why this Court must accept the collateral -- the holding by the Arizona courts that the proceedings here were collateral.
To the extent that there is a concern that a collateral proceeding is insufficient, that is not a question that is properly before the Court. The Court can't use that to second-guess the Arizona state court's conclusion. When -- when you say that the proceedings were collateral, and putting aside the question of whether that gets you out of the obligation to apply new rules of constitutional law, is the labeling collateral, does that make a difference in terms of what the State Supreme Court actually does? It does, Your Honor. The -- there are two chief categories of differences.
First, as to the aggravation and mitigation analysis itself, the collateral second independent review is very different. In the first independent review, the Arizona Supreme Court engages in a searching analysis as to the basis of the aggravators and the mitigators.
That leads, for example, in the Styers case, and in the consolidated opinion here, for the Hedlund -- That may be -- I think you're answering a question I didn't ask. Assume that this had gone back to the state appeals court on direct review.
In other words, it had gone up, the Ninth Circuit said that there was a mistake, the appeals court says: Okay, we have to correct our mistake. Would it look any different if you labeled it ""direct"" as opposed to ""collateral""? I think -- I think I'm trying to get at that, which is, on direct, the Court would look through and has in multiple cases, in the Styers case, in the consolidated opinion here, will reject an aggravator and will go through and -- and make differences in terms of what is the aggravation and mitigation coming out of the trial court. But, on the second time around, it's been very clear in Styers and in the Hedlund opinion and here, there is no revisiting of the aggravation and mitigation.
And I will point out that here -- But I guess I'm -- I'm asking you to do it the second time around both ways.
In other words, it's gone up.
The Ninth Circuit has said: It's in error.
One way the Ninth Circuit has said you have to reopen the direct proceedings. On that reopening, the direct proceedings, after the finding of error, would you go through the entire analysis all over again, or would you just make the correction in the exact same way that you made it in the collateral proceedings? I -- we don't have an example of that.
All I can tell you is that when independent review is done in the context of direct, there's a searching analysis, aggravators will be rejected.
And in the three cases in which a collateral independent review has been used, the court has been clear that they will not revisit aggravators and mitigators, even when they are challenged. Here, Petitioner challenged the existing aggravators, and the court said we're not going there. I guess the intent of my question is to suggest that the -- the correction -- the -- the analysis by which you say, okay, we have to correct the error and now that we correct the error, we have to decide whether that does or does not mean that we need to change the sentence, that you would -- you just have to do that either way. And the label is not what makes a difference, that you're essentially redoing what the direct -- what the state supreme court did on direct with the error corrected. So I -- I'm trying to get at the idea that in -- in a first direct independent review, there is much more done -- I know. I -- I -- I -- But the question is not the first one. Yeah. The question is what happens after the Ninth Circuit says go correct the error.
Okay? And if all you're doing in this supposedly collateral review is correcting the error as any other state supreme court would do when they're told to go correct their mistake on -- in -- in -- in the direct appeal, then the fact that you label it collateral does not seem to make all that much of a difference. If the court had -- if the court were to engage in the type of specific correction that occurred here and they said that it was really indirect, it's possible they would do that.
I do think that, based on past practice, if the Arizona Supreme Court believes that they are engaging in a full, direct, independent review as they would the first time around, then they will do -- they will go in a far more searching analysis.
They will address arguments that weren't even raised in the Hedlund companion case, here in the consolidated opinion, an aggravator was struck for not even the reason that the Petitioner -- that that defendant had identified. It's possible that they could just go back and say we're going to do a narrow correction, but we're going to do it in the direct context.
We've never seen that.
And I -- I don't know that that's necessarily how they would approach it.
They would view it as redoing from start to finish the independent review with all of the steps -- Could -- -- including going to the aggravators -- -- can I ask, I think, maybe the same question? But if this had come up on -- to this -- this Court on direct, we'd said what the Ninth Circuit said, Eddings error, and sent it back to the Arizona Supreme Court, would that remand proceeding at the Arizona Supreme Court have looked different, I think, from the collateral proceeding that occurred here? I -- I think that's getting at the question as well. Yeah.
And -- and this -- this is a -- Same answer? It's a hard one.
I think it's the same answer.
I believe -- we believe the State's position would be that that would require a full-blown independent review of all the steps -- But why -- why would that be? Why? I mean, usually, when we say go correct your error, we just mean go correct that error.
We don't mean you have to do everything else. I think it partly stems from the idea that there would have never been a -- it's possible that they would have done a more narrow analysis, but just because of how many steps Arizona has put in place as safeguards in the death penalty context, an independent review the first time around will address issues not even raised. If a defendant stands -- counsel stands up and says there are no sentencing issues, there will still be an analysis.
I just suspect that's what they would do because there would have been no finality. If it comes up on direct and this Court finds an error and it goes back down, I think they would have felt very much like there was no finality that needed to be deferred to, there was no aspect of the case that would have -- would have counseled toward a more narrow aspect of correcting the error.
Here, when it returned 20 years later, it's different. Still back at Clemons, I'm trying to figure this out.
As I see it, I'm imagining we have two scale pans, all right? And over here in the A pan are a whole bunch of aggravators, and over here in the B pan are a whole bunch of mitigators. And now it is the law in Arizona, imagine, that this weighing can take place in the Supreme Court of Arizona, period.
Okay? Suppose that's the law.
It's all fine.
But they make a mistake about the B pan.
There's some mistake which is found out later. So it's sent back to them.
And you say, well, they can do the weighing anyway under -- under Arizona law.
That's it.
They just have to redo it.
But wait, in the meantime, a new constitutional principle has been announced. And the new one is, when you see what's in the A pan, that has to be found with a lawyer present. You see what's in the B pan? A lawyer has to be present. And, lo and behold, this person had no lawyer at sentencing.
Wouldn't it be obvious in that case that you can't do the weighing in the Supreme Court of Arizona without sending it back for a hearing where there's a lawyer? That -- You see where I'm going? I see where you're -- it begins with the question of whether the new rule that's announced applies.
If -- we have not disputed -- Yeah.
The new rule that is announced is that the A pan factors and the B pan factors have to be found with a lawyer present.
All right? I mean, a lawyer has to -- you understand what I'm saying.
Gideon v. Wainwright, step 2 or something.
I don't know. If Ring and Hurst apply to this case, we do not dispute -- All right.
I know, and now I'm saying -- -- that we don't have reasonable parameters -- -- but why in heavens name wouldn't they? I mean, of course, that's going to be the next thing I'd ask.
But -- but, if I take your view that they don't apply, it sounds as if we'll -- I'm trying to make it as basic as I can.
Hey, you have to have a lawyer. And, by the way, when you do that reweighing, you're going to reweigh factors that were found without a lawyer. And I think it's obvious you couldn't do that.
And if it's obvious you couldn't do that, Ring says about the same thing.
And Hurst.
It doesn't say you have to have a lawyer present, but it does say a jury has to find those bits that are there in the A pan, and -- and -- you see that's -- that -- and I -- and I want you to -- you don't want me to reason that way, and so I want you to tell me why not. A critical component here is the idea of what the Ninth Circuit identified, what the Ninth Circuit asked Arizona to do.
Arizona followed from a conditional habeas writ that did not require vacating the sentence, that allowed the sentence to stand, engaged in new proceedings exactly as were done in Styers and were -- were found to be acceptable by the federal courts at the District of Arizona and the Ninth Circuit. And, here, when the Arizona Supreme Court says that the error correction process we're engaging in is collateral in nature, the Court here, federal courts don't get to second-guess that.
There may be consequences from that. And that's still true if it's Gideon v. Wainwright? There may be -- Ahh, I see -- There is an exception to the -- -- you're a little pushed there. -- there's a -- there's -- Well, I suppose it depends on the underlying determination whether those new rules are retroactive or not. Yeah. In the one circumstance, you -- you would be evading the rule against -- or the -- your friend would be evading the rule against retroactivity, and in the other situation, I assume the State would not. Yeah, to the -- yes. Going back to the Gideon versus Wainwright example, there is an exception to the modern retroactivity framework for certain rules that may be so essential.
And -- and setting that aside, the -- there may be consequences from the State of Arizona, the Arizona Supreme Court, labeling the procedure as collateral. Yeah. It may be that that is insufficient to satisfy the court that granted the habeas writ. All right.
So that's why you say -- I think -- look, I'm -- I'm getting this much better.
I mean, I thought -- the Gideon v. Wainwright example I thought distinguishes Clemons because Clemons, there was no intervening rule that said the things in the two pans had to be found in a certain way. But there is here.
But maybe this new thing doesn't apply in collateral.
I think that's the -- Well, 100 percent. So that's why you -- Yeah.
I mean -- All right. -- like going to Ring. Ring is not retroactive.
If we are -- if -- if we are in a collateral proceeding, which we are, then it doesn't apply.
Just like it doesn't apply in a 2255.
There may be -- there may be other issues that arise from us using a collateral proceeding. Uh-huh. That -- any of those issues are properly before other courts and don't allow this Court to second-guess the nature of Arizona's proceedings. I guess -- I think that -- -- General Skinner, the real question that Justice Breyer is asking is, call it reopening, call it redoing, call it whatever you want, but you're correcting what happened on direct appeal, and we -- and -- and -- and you're doing it now.
You have to do it now. And now we know that Ring would apply, and it's -- it's a -- it's a little bit strange to have a new proceeding where a rule that's been around for 20 years is not being applied. I -- going back to the harmless error, had the Ninth Circuit remanded to the Arizona Supreme Court for harmless error analysis, it is not obvious to me at all that that would be an inadequate resolution of a non-structural constitutional violation and that you couldn't engage in a collateral harmless error analysis and -- and thereby correct the problem.
It is -- again, this goes -- Well, possible, but maybe the reason that you're going to the harmless error case instead of your own case is that, in your own case, the error had to do with the fundamental question of sentencing, which is weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and coming up with the right sentence. And that you're having to do again because the initial inquiry had a constitutional defect.
And whether you say that you're doing it in a collateral proceeding or you say that you're doing it in a direct proceeding, I mean, essentially, you're -- you're having a new proceeding to correct the constitutional error, and you're having it in the year 2019, when Ring would apply to any other new proceeding. And the question is, why does your new proceeding not also have to comply with Ring? It would apply to any new proceeding that is part of a direct review process.
To the extent that there was a third, fourth, fifth state post-conviction motion, to the extent that there is a long pending -- as this occurred here -- many years in the District of Arizona and the Ninth Circuit, collateral proceeding, Ring wouldn't apply to any reanalysis or reexamination. Yes, but it's a reanalysis of an analysis that was done in the direct proceeding.
So it's a redo of the direct proceeding.
Whatever you want to call that, it's a redo of the direct proceeding. I -- I -- the -- any -- the -- as this Court noted in Wall, any collateral proceeding is going to invariably entail a reexamination of something that occurred in a direct proceeding. On the -- on the harm -- keep going, I'm sorry. So -- and then crucially here, once -- our position is once a case is final on direct review, as this was 23 years ago, the touchstone for how you would undo that finality is to vacate the sentence. The Ninth Circuit in the District of Arizona knew exactly how to tell us that we had to vacate the sentence -- On -- on the harmless error point, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question, I think you were saying that harmless error could have been done by the Ninth Circuit on habeas, and so, too, a state habeas court could do the harmless error analysis. Is that correct so far? Yes. Okay.
And then I think Justice Kagan's point gets at the question of what's -- is this different in essence on some fundamental way from harmless error analysis.
I think your answer is no.
And can you -- if that's true, can you explain that? I think it is different to the extent that we are providing additional process to the defendant, and in -- in particular, but I think as a matter of type.
To the extent that a harmless -- It's very similar, I think, is what you're arguing. Yes.
As a type, it is very similar, but I would never say that what we did was -- In -- in Clemons, they -- they're analyzed back to back. Yes.
Both options were left open by the court as available paths for appellate correction of trial court error in Clemons.
And we believe -- May -- I'm sorry, could -- -- may I ask you a question about the -- the -- the error wasn't saying we won't count this mitigator, because there was no causal connection.
And then the Arizona Supreme Court says the causal connection still counts.
It doesn't mean you can't consider the evidence.
But it gets very little weight because there's no causal connection. They're not taking the causal connection out of it.
They're saying this mitigator is affected by the absence of causal -- causal connection is still playing a factor. Yes.
And -- and this goes to what Eddings does and doesn't require. Eddings specifically says that minimal weight or low weight can be given, that the court was not saying how much weight needed to be given, but that something must be considered. And -- and that's -- and that we believe is entirely satisfied by the second independent review here. There's no standalone new Eddings error. Could -- you resisted Justice Kavanaugh a little bit when he was trying to equate the harmless error to this. And I think you started to say this was something more than harmless error review.
Is that correct? My argument was that it was -- this is -- we believe this gives more process than harmless error review, but that, as a type, this is very similar to harmless error, and to the extent that harmless error is an available correction -- So what's the more process? The -- What -- what's your definition of ""more process""? The more process is not analyzing -- as a part of harmless error, not analyzing what would an imaginary person have -- have done -- what would an imaginary set of judges or a jury done if this evidence had been considered but, instead, allow briefing and say we're going to now look at the evidence and make our determination. And that's what happened.
So it was a whole -- how would it have differed from the original appeal? In an original appeal -- In a direct -- Yeah.
In -- in independent review on direct, there's two significant categories of differences.
The first one that I didn't get to earlier is the scope of the sentencing issues that will be addressed in independent review. In the initial independent review here, the Petitioner challenged the nature of the special verdict, that it was read instead of written. And the second independent review, the Petitioner brought up a new standalone Eighth Amendment claim.
That second time around, that's not revisited because the only analysis goes to the narrow aggravation and mitigation issue. The aggravators are still accepted, for example, for the co-defendant, the striking of the existing aggravator before stays, and all that's done is a -- is a -- How would the process have differed for the issue that was identified as an error? If you focus down all the way on the consideration of the mitigation, there is a consideration of the mitigation in the same manner as the first time around, but that's zooming in past all the rest of the independent review and acknowledging that when you get down, that means we fixed it. We went back and looked at the thing that was identified as a problem, conducted the analysis without a causal nexus, and corrected the identified problem that the Ninth Circuit had said occurred in the Arizona Supreme Court. It's an appellate court correcting an appellate error on a built record.
There's never been an allegation of something that was excluded from the record that might make this case very different. And this is, we think, a straightforward application of Clemons and that this entire case is driven by Question Presented one. And I would point out that Petitioner has offered no grounding principle for what would replace direct versus collateral as the measure for retroactivity if this Court were to upend modern retroactivity. He has cited the phrase ""any time something is again subject to modification,"" but I don't think that's a fair statement of the Court's opinion in Jiminez. But, more importantly, it would turn any 2255 proceeding, in which a sentence was again at risk, could again be corrected or vacated, into a direct proceeding for retroactivity purposes. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Katyal. Thank you.
I'd like to begin with Clemons, which, of course, is only about question 2.
It doesn't answer question 1 for reasons Justice Sotomayor has said.
So four things about Clemons: Number one, it's a very limited decision.
It's a subtraction of one aggravating factor.
As I was saying to Justice Kavanaugh, this is the opposite.
This is everything happened.
The Ninth Circuit, this is at Petition Appendix page 59a, required a resentencing.
And then the State came in and asked for a full-blown independent review, using that phrase four times.
That's at Joint Appendix pages 385 to 89. And that's exactly what the Arizona Supreme Court did.
My friend said, oh, it was a limited proceeding, this and that.
Absolutely not.
It was more extensive, actually, than the 1996 first independent review when they came back in 2016 and did it. They considered, for example, the aggravators and weighed them, at Petition Appendix pages 4a and 7a. Now, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked me about Justice Blackmun's dissent, which I had an occasion to look at again just now.
And Justice Blackmun's dissent is about one thing, which is the consideration of aggravating factors. And he said that's something that should be done by the trial court.
And, you know, whether he was right or wrong about that, that was only about aggravating factors. Our point to you in all of the decisions are about the consideration at the trial court of mitigating circumstances. So, for example, Mills at page 375 says, ""because the sentencers' failure to consider all of the mitigating evidence risks erroneous imposition of the death sentence, it's our duty to remand for resentencing."" And there's case after case about that.
Why is an aggravating circumstance different than a mitigating one? Because mitigating ones go to mercy, in which this Court in Caldwell has said that's the thing in which you need the jury to see, or -- or at least the trial court, to see upfront and personal as opposed to on a cold record. And that's why we don't think, you know, you should extend Clemons, particularly given this Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst and Haymond, all of which suggest that really juries have a fundamental role here. Now, with respect to question 1, our point to you is that resentencing was required by the Ninth Circuit.
They got a full-blown resentencing. We're not challenging -- he has some argument about a DIG.
We're not -- it wasn't in the briefs in opposition or below.
We're not challenging the Ninth Circuit's determination. We're challenging the Arizona Supreme Court's decision here to not comply with the law of this Court, Eddings and Jiminez, which reopened the conviction. Now, if you accept their view, you're going to basically license a state to slap the label of collateral review on and allow them to conduct new sentencing proceedings that will evade Batson, that will undermine everything that Justice Harwin tried to do when he tried to overrule -- when he overruled Linkletter.
And they'll be able to pick cases and say, oh, this time it won't be final.
That time it will. That's a very dangerous thing. I agree there are difficult cases, and my friend ended with this, there will be some difficult cases in the middle, but this is not that.
Eddings is the heart of what capital sentencing is about. And so, if you allow a reweighing for the first time on an appellate court when there's never been one in the trial court, you are -- you know, you're basically doing everything at that second stage.
And that, I think, is -- is profoundly -- profoundly against what this Court's precedents are. He's right to say Jimenez doesn't directly control this case.
That's not our argument.
Our argument is Jimenez states a truism, that when a case is final, as it was in 1996 when the Court ruled, it can be reopened by voluntary action by the state. And, here, that action happened.
The state reopened and set the clock back to 1996, and they -- you see when you look at and compare side-by-side the 2016 -- 2018 opinion to the -- to the 1996 one, there's actually more extensive analysis.
It's the opposite of harmless error review and the stuff he was talking about in -- in his remarks. If there are any questions. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-935, Monasky versus Taglieri. Mr. Tayrani. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction is designed to protect children who have a country of habitual residence from the harmful effects of wrongful removal from that country.
In this case, however, the Convention was applied to separate two-year-old A.M.T. from her mother, the only caregiver A.M.T. had ever known, and to return the child to Italy, a country where A.M.T. had spent only the first eight weeks of her life. The Sixth Circuit's decision upholding A.M.T.'s return to Italy rests on an erroneous definition of habitual residence.
The Sixth Circuit held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent to raise A.M.T. in Italy even if they had no meeting of the minds.
The court never explained how parents can share an intent about where a child will live if there is no actual agreement between them. Tellingly, neither Taglieri nor the United States defends the Sixth Circuit's habitual residence standard.
They instead urge this Court to adopt an amorphous, all relevant circumstances inquiry.
But, in cases involving infants, the foreign jurisdictions on which Taglieri and the United States rely actually apply a different habitual residence standard. That standard focuses on the primary caregiver's connections to the country of removal, a far more appropriate inquiry. Ultimately, however, under any of the competing definitions of habitual residence and standards of review, the outcome of this case is the same.
Eight-week-old A.M.T. was not habitually resident in Italy.
Indeed, the district court's unchallenged finding that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible is virtually dispositive. This Court should put an end to this already four-year-old litigation by entering an order directing A.M.T.'s return to the United States. I'd like to turn first to the definition of habitual residence. The Sixth Circuit applied a shared parental intent standard in name only because it held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent for her to live in Italy even if they had no meeting of the minds or actual agreement -- Mr. Tay -- -- on that issue. -- Tayrani, a -- a problem with your position, I take it your view is this child, taken to the United States at eight weeks old, has no habitual residence? That is our position, Your Honor. And if that's so, then there are many children who would not be covered by the Convention.
The whole idea of the Convention was to stop unilateral decisions to move a child.
And you would be taking out of the Convention's coverage cases of very young children. With respect, I disagree with the proposition that our approach would lead to a large number of children who do not have a country of habitual residence. First of all, we're talking in this case only about infants.
Older children are evaluated under a different standard, and in all likelihood, based on their connections, their acclimatization to the country in which they reside, they would have a country of habitual residence.
Even with respect to infants, we're dealing here with the unusual case where the breakdown of the parties' relationship was simultaneous with Monasky's pregnancy and the birth of the child. In any case, where the breakdown of the relationship occurs later in time, in all likelihood, there will be an agreement between the parents as to where the child will live for at least the foreseeable future.
But, from the standpoint of the objectives of the Hague Convention, there's nothing wrong with recognizing that a subset of children will have no country of habitual residence, because -- The problem with the -- a standard that says if you -- the parents have to have an agreement, in many of these cases, the relationship between the parents is so acrimonious that the likelihood of -- of a actual agreement is slim to none. That would only be the case, Your Honor, if the acrimony was simultaneous with the pregnancy and birth.
In other cases involving infants, the breakdown of the relationship may occur later in time.
And if there was a meeting of the minds after the child's birth, that would be controlling.
A single parent could not unilaterally disavow that agreement. But from -- So you think this agreement is irrevocable? If there's a -- I doubt that there are going to be very many cases where there's a written agreement.
So you think that if, at the beginning, at the time of the child's birth, there's a tacit agreement between the parents, that's irrevocable, and then, if the relationship breaks down over a period of time that -- where you might otherwise infer that there is no longer any agreement, that would not count? That's exactly our approach, Your Honor.
The -- the agreement, once it's in place, is irrevocable until the standard for older children comes into play, which would be an acclimatization-based standard. But, for infants, once the parents have reached a meeting of the minds, a single parent cannot unilaterally disavow that agreement. Counsel, we're -- we're talking about an international convention, and yet none of the other parties to the Convention have adopted your position.
The -- the courts of Canada, the U.K., the EU, Australia, and others have, in fact, rejected it. We have said one of the important guiding principles when interpreting the Convention is what the other countries do.
Why should we depart from that guideline here? Your Honor, every circuit that has addressed this issue applies some version of the shared parental intent standard to infants.
Some circuits apply the additional actual agreement requirement that we're urging this Court to adopt.
But every circuit applies some version of shared parental intent. Well, but I'm -- you don't dispute the fact that no other country, no other signatory to the Convention, has adopted your position? I don't dispute that, Your Honor.
But, to the extent that this Court is inclined to follow the approach of foreign jurisdictions, then the relevant test here is not the all relevant circumstances test advocated by Taglieri and the United States. It's the primary caregiver focused standard that the relevant foreign jurisdictions actually apply in cases involving infants.
And that's the EU Court of Justice in the Mercredi decision.
It's the U.K. Supreme Court in the A versus A decision.
It's the Australian High Court in the L.K. decision.
All of those courts have recognized that in cases involving infants, it's the primary caregiver's connections to the country of removal that determine whether the infant has a country of habitual residence. And -- But how did you get that out of -- I read Chief Justice Hale's opinion, and it seems to me that she made a huge point that this is family law.
You know, families differ.
There are vast differences. And don't treat these words ""habitual residence"" as if it's like a black-letter tax code.
They're more like a factual matter.
And let the judge who's closest to it, even though he's not a family court judge -- unfortunately, it's a federal system because it's a treaty -- let them hear all the evidence and decide it. And that's it. I mean, not 100 percent it, but that's it.
And as soon as nine people who know -- I, speaking for myself, know very little about this -- start laying down black-letter standards, all we're going to do is maybe help people in some cases and just cause chaos and hardship in others. Well, there need -- That's -- that's basically what I got out of her opinion.
It seems to me that's the British court, and that sounds pretty sensible to me. Your Honor, the U.K. Supreme Court makes clear that while an all relevant circumstances test is generally appropriate, in the case of an infant, the infant's connections to her environment are formed through her primary caregiver. Well, that may be in some cases.
That may well be.
And in other cases, maybe it isn't.
I don't know every family in the world. And so, I mean, maybe we read it differently, but I really read Justice Hale's opinion as just saying what I just said.
So, Judge, be careful.
This is factual.
It involves families.
Don't adopt a standard. Just let them apply these words. Now where is it -- where -- where is that -- where did I get it wrong? Your Honor, the U.K. Supreme Court follows the approach of the European Union Court of Justice in the Mercredi decision, and Mercredi makes very clear that, in cases involving infants, a primary caregiver focused approach is the test that should be applied.
But, under any of the competing tests that we're discussing here today, the outcome is the same on these facts. Can I ask you a question about your position that somewhat puzzles me? You think that, in this case, the dispositive question is whether there was an agreement between the parents? Am I right? Yes, Your Honor. And then you say that there should be review de novo.
But that's a -- if the question is whether there was an agreement between the parents, isn't that a pure question of fact? Why would it be reviewed de novo? It would be reviewed de novo, Your Honor, because, while historical facts would be reviewed for clear error, the application of the habitual residence standard, the actual agreement requirement to those facts, is a mixed question of law and fact. Why -- why is it a mixed question? Was there an agreement between the parents or was there not an agreement between the parents? It's a question of fact, pure fact. Because there does not need to be a written agreement.
There doesn't even need to be an express oral agreement.
An agreement can be -- Well, was there a tacit agreement? It's a question of fact. It is just as much a question of fact as a reasonable suspicion or probable cause determination, which this Court has held -- No -- -- would be -- -- because those involve the application of a complicated legal standard. Your Honor, the fact that we're here today would suggest that the habitual residence standard is less than straightforward. Lower courts are in need of guidance from appellate courts setting forth clear legal principles about how to make a habitual residence determination, just as lower courts need guidance about how to ascertain the existence of reasonable suspicion and probable cause. This Court emphasized the need for clear guidance in the Ornelas case, where it held that probable cause and reasonable suspicion are reviewed de novo. And it's not only courts that need guidance.
It's parents who are confronted with these difficult decisions about whether to remove a child from a dangerous situation. They need to know, if a child is removed, what is the likelihood that the child will be returned under the Hague Convention. But over and over in the -- in the history of this Convention is that they don't want any rigid test.
They don't want domicile.
They don't want nationality. They want a totality of the circumstances. And -- and the government points to the Seventh Circuit case, the Redmond case, saying that no one factor should be considered controlling.
You just take all the factors and a district judge should weigh those and come to a conclusion. Your Honor, the problem with that approach is that it will breed disuniform outcomes.
It will prolong Hague Convention litigation.
It will undermine the deterrent effect of the Hague Convention by undermining the clear rules that would otherwise apply in this setting. But, to the extent that this Court is inclined to look at the approach of foreign courts, we would urge the Court to adopt a primary caregiver focused standard.
If the Court applies an all relevant circumstances test, however, it is essential that this Court not only adopt that standard but then go on and apply that standard to the facts of this case. The Hague Convention sets a goal of resolving these cases within six weeks.
This case has been going on for four and a half years.
Under Article II of the Hague Convention, signatory states have an obligation to use the most expeditious procedures available to resolve -- On -- on your -- -- these cases. -- on the standard of review, doesn't de novo review necessarily prolong the matter? I don't think so, Your Honor.
De novo review facilitates the -- Because it's going to push everything into the court of appeals then, rearguing everything that's already been decided by the district court without any deference, so people will take appeals much more readily. Given the stakes in these cases, it's likely that the losing parent in the district court will appeal whatever the standard of review is.
De novo appellate review promotes the development of clear legal principles that district courts can apply more readily, more expeditiously, and that appellate courts, in turn, can also apply in an expeditious manner. If this Court adopts an all relevant circumstances test, then it would be displacing the shared parental intent standard that every circuit applies, which is why it is of overriding importance that this Court -- In every circuit, not the Seventh Circuit. That -- that is not a case involving infants, Your Honor, the Redmond case.
Every circuit that looks at the habitual residence of an infant applies a test that looks to shared parental intent.
Some circuits also look at actual agreement as part of that shared parental intent inquiry. The need for guidance from this Court is of surpassing importance because this Court would be adopting for the first time an all relevant circumstances test that no lower court currently applies in a case involving infants. In order to live up to the United States' obligation to use the most expeditious procedures available to resolve these cases, this Court should not only adopt a standard and -- a standard of review and a definition of habitual residence but should go on and apply that standard to the facts of this case so that this four-and-a-half-year-old litigation is brought to an end, so that district courts have guidance about how the habitual residence standard will be applied. On the facts of this case -- How -- how will it be brought to an end? The child is now in Italy, and no doubt the Italian courts would weigh in, so this -- this determination of habitual residence is not going to settle where this child -- the custody of this -- this child. That's correct, Your Honor.
Hague Convention cases don't determine custody.
They determine the venue in which child custody determinations will be made. The appropriate venue for this child custody determination is the United States. And, in fact, there has been no child custody determination in Italy.
The Italian courts refused to make that determination because Monasky's parental rights were terminated in an ex parte proceeding of which she had no notice and no opportunity to be heard. If A.M.T. is returned to the United States, then there will be a full and fair child custody hearing. But that will depend on the Italian authorities returning her. And given the position that they've taken up until now, that seems most unlikely. Your Honor, we believe as a matter of comity that the Italian courts would return A.M.T. and would adhere -- The court that has declared her a non-parent -- Your Honor -- -- would do that? -- as -- as a matter of comity, we believe that the Italian courts would adhere to an order from this Court directing the re-return of A.M.T.
There is precedent for foreign courts following re-return orders. In the Larbie case, which is one of the cases that this Court cited in its Chafin opinion as an example of a case where a district court issued a re-return order, the case went all the way up to the U.K. Supreme Court as to whether to adhere to that re-return order, and the U.K. Supreme Court ordered the child returned -- Well -- -- to the United States. -- there hasn't been any case where we're talking about a -- a time in the -- the other country as long as this.
This would be the longest period of time in which any re-return order has been entered, wouldn't it? I don't know if it is the longest period of time.
To the extent that Taglieri has concerns about the propriety of re-return, those are issues that he could raise before an Italian court when we move to enforce the re-return order.
But in the absence -- Which would just delay the proceedings that have already been delayed far longer than the Convention contemplated. But, Your Honor, in the absence of a re-return order, the grave error committed by the lower courts will remain unremedied.
As this Court held in the Chafin case, a re-return order is typical appellate relief. But I'm not interested for the -- hypothetically, oddly enough, in the law.
Suppose I were interested in how do we get to what's in the best interests of the child.
Look at it from that point of view.
What do we do? The best interests -- And I also think judges, particularly federal judges, don't know much about this. So, in Italy, is there a family court, or what's -- what do I do? I don't know.
This is a -- a genuinely open question.
I don't know what to do if my object is to try to secure the best interests of the child.
And you're familiar with this case, you tell me. Your Honor, the best interests of the child would be furthered by returning A.M.T. to the United States so that there can be a full and fair child custody hearing at which a state court judge, steeped in family law issues, can make a determination about who should have custody and what is, in fact, in A.M.T.'s best interest. But, in the absence of a re-return order, no court -- I'm sorry, I thought that there was a special order of the Italian court giving the mother some visitation rights, albeit limited.
It's not clear to me that you're representing to me that there is no method or manner for her to go back to the Italian court and reopen or revisit the custody issue? I'm not representing that there is no procedural -- So assuming, as I do, that there has to be something that can secure greater rights for her, why should it be here instead of there, assuming -- and you don't want me to assume this -- that the totality of the circumstances suggests that she has acclimated? Your Honor, Monasky has -- I mean, after two and a half years, even under the Convention, you don't have to return a child who's been settled for greater -- greater than one year.
So -- That's correct, Your Honor.
That does not bear upon the availability -- No, of -- -- of a re-return -- -- of the return -- of the return, but -- but I still am wondering why it is that it's the American court, rather than the Italian court, who should be dealing with the custody issue. Well, first of all, because Italy was not A.M.T.'s country of habitual residence.
So she never should have been returned to Italy in the first place.
The only way to remedy that wrong -- Well, that -- that's a really interesting question, because I'm not sure -- unless we accept your premise that the mother's intent controls, but she was only here a couple of months when the father sought custody -- re-return of her.
So it's hard to say she was acclimated in those couple of months either. But, Your Honor, the question is whether A.M.T. had the type of meaningful, settled, stable existence in Italy when she was removed at eight weeks of age to establish a habitual residence there. And she must -- How old -- how old is the child now? She is four and a half years old, Your Honor.
A.M.T. did not have that type of existence within her fleeting eight weeks of living in Italy.
The Hague Convention is designed to protect children who have a stable -- stable, settled existence. That is what is explained in paragraph 72 of the accompanying explanatory report. There will be some children such as A.M.T. who don't form those types of settled connections to a country and whose return to the country of removal is actually detrimental -- But -- -- to the interests -- -- let me understand. Your position is that she had no habitual residence at that time? That's correct, Your Honor. Is that correct? Not that she had habitual residence -- all right. So either parent at that time could snatch her, and possession would be ten-tenths of the law, right? The Hague Convention would not speak to that removal, Your Honor. That doesn't mean that the left-behind parent would be without remedies.
The left-behind parent could seek relief, for example, under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.
The left-behind parent would have the opportunity to participate in a child custody hearing in the country of removal. That -- But the Convention, which was meant to solve this problem of unilateral removal, would not apply? The Convention would not apply if a child had no country of habitual residence.
But, as the very foreign jurisdictions on which Taglieri and the United States rely, including the U.K. Supreme Court, the Australian High Court, and courts in New Zealand have recognized, not every child will have a country of habitual residence -- How -- how long does the child have to -- how old does a child have to be before you would say they have a habitual residence? It -- Eight weeks under your theory is not enough, but one year, two years? Well, at a certain point, around 18 to 24 months, the focus would shift to the child's own acclimation to his or her surroundings, because the child -- Where do you get -- where do you get that number from? Based on the development of a child, child psychology.
At a certain point, the lower courts shift their test from shared parental intent to acclimatization, once the child has formed his or her own connections. Under the shared parental intent standard for infants, the inquiry looks at whether the intent of the parents is a proxy for the type of settled, stable, meaningful ties that an older child would be able to form.
And there will be some children who do not have a country of habitual residence because they did not form the type of settled, stable ties that the Hague Convention is designed to protect. Returning a child to a country where it did not have meaningful connections is just as harmful to that child as permitting the child's removal from a country of -- Mr. Tayrani -- -- habitual residence. -- Judge Boggs suggests that in the case of children, children who have lived in a single place for their entire lives, in the case of infant children, that is, who have lived in a single country their entire lives with both parents, that the usual rule should be that's their habitual residence, not irrebuttable, but that that should be the usual rule, that that's their habitual residence. And that's certainly a very administrable rule.
It provides a lot of guidance.
And it deters anybody, either parent, from taking the child anywhere else, which seems to be of value too. So why isn't the Judge Boggs rule the right one for infants? The problem with that approach, Your Honor, is that it conflates a child's residence with her habitual residence. If the signatories to the Hague Convention had wanted to enact an agreement that was all encompassing, that applied to all children, they would have prohibited the removal of a child from his country of residence without the approval of both parents. What they instead did was enact a more targeted provision that prevents the wrongful removal of a child from his country of habitual residence because the signatories recognize that removing a child from a country of habitual residence, where the child has meaningful ties, has a stable existence, would be harmful to the child. But they also recognize that returning a child to a country where it lacks those ties, lacks those connections, would be just as harmful to the child's interests.
That is the fundamental problem with the one country rule advocated by the panel in the Sixth Circuit. But whatever the test is that this Court adopts, the outcome is the same.
The facts are overwhelming here that, as a result of the physical and sexual abuse to which Monasky was subject, she formed the intent during her pregnancy to return to the United States with her child as soon as possible.
That's what the district court found, at Pet. App. 94a, that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible. And that's what she did.
The day that A.M.T.'s U.S. passport arrived, Monasky left and returned to the United States, fled from the dangerous situation in which she found herself. The signatories to the Hague Convention would never have intended to prevent a mother from removing her child from those dangerous circumstances. Why? That's a question I have here.
Of course, there's child abuse or spousal abuse raised throughout this, which is a serious problem.
So why does this case not involve Article 13, where you don't return a child if there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation? That provision would seem designed for the problem of spousal abuse. Mr. Chief -- Why isn't it here? -- Justice, may I answer the question? Yes. Your Honor, we did urge the district court to apply the exception for grave risk of harm to A.M.T.
Unfortunately, lower courts have construed that exception narrowly.
And in this case, even though the district court credited Monasky's allegations about the extensive physical and sexual abuse to which she was subjected, the court concluded that that abuse directed to Monasky was not sufficient to create a grave risk of harm to A.M.T. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Joshi. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Habitual residence is a flexible, fact-intensive concept.
That's precisely why the drafters and ratifiers of the Hague Convention picked it over the alternatives, like domicile or nationality.
It asks a very straightforward question: Where does the child usually live? Where's the child at home? Answering that question requires looking at the case-specific facts on the ground, unencumbered by rigid, mechanical, per se tests.
That includes Petitioner's rigid, mechanical, per se test about a shared -- or, I'm sorry, a subjective agreement or a meeting of the minds. That is not necessary to establishing a child's habitual residence.
It's not even necessary to establishing a shared parental intent, which itself is not necessary to establishing habitual residence. And that test applies equally to infants and to older children.
Nothing in the Convention's text or structure suggests that habitual residence carries a different definition depending on the age of the child. So that takes care of one question presented. On the other one, because determining habitual residence is primarily a factual inquiry and involves factual work, this Court's framework in U.S. Bank or Lakeridge applies, and there's no reason to deviate from that rule. In fact, that rule would also provide, we believe, the most consistent results, including consistency of outcome, as Petitioner asks for, because the best way to be consistent is to be right, and the best way to be right on a fact-intensive question is to trust the district judge. Well, this is what -- When -- -- puzzles me about your position, which does seem to reflect the decisions of foreign courts, and maybe something has just been lost in -- in translation. But it's -- it's fine to say take everything into account and be flexible.
But that's not very helpful unless one knows the question to be answered after taking everything into account and being flexible.
And so the -- the -- the critical point is what is meant by habitual residence. Now you said it's where the child usually lives.
If that's the test that Judge Boggs had, I understand it.
But, if it's something more than that, then I really don't know what habitual residence means. So we think where a child usually lives is the test.
And it's sort of hard to explain it more than that.
In most cases, it's going to be quite easy to tell where the child usually lives, including for infants. I mean, I -- I would wager if you walk down the streets of D.C. and found parents with infants and said where does your infant child usually live, they'd say with us at home. And it's oftentimes when these cases are in dispute, when habitual residence is in dispute, and it's a very small fraction even of Hague Convention cases, in those situations, it's going to be very hard to come up with an ex ante rule or test that's going to be useful in that circumstance. Well, what if the parents live, from the time of the child's birth until the time when the issue comes up, in a particular country, but it was never their intention to stay there permanently? Would that country be where the child usually lives? It -- that -- that's a very difficult question.
And I -- I can imagine many factors that might push you one way or the other. For example, if that's where they had been living for quite some time but just had some future plans to move, that might well be where the child was usually living on the date of the -- or, you know, immediately before the -- the wrongful retention or removal, as Article III calls for. On the other hand, if you're telling me that, in fact, they have a permanent residence in another country and they were, you know, in the country of birth just on vacation and she went into early labor and the child was born there, but all their connections are back in the other country, it might be a much more difficult question. The point is where habitual residence is disputed in those small fraction of cases, there's very little ex ante guidance that's going to be useful, except to say the question is, where does the child usually live or, if it helps to think of it this way, where is the child at home? And so -- Counsel -- Well, that's kind of a meaningless concept, where the child usually lives, if you're talking about somebody who's eight-weeks-old. Again, as I -- I mean, it's not as if they'd laid down roots. That -- that's -- Eight-year-old -- eight-week-old infants don't have habits, well, other than one or two, but -- (Laughter.) -- but it doesn't seem to me that that's the notion that the Convention drafters were looking at. It -- it isn't.
And -- and I think it's important to realize that, although the word is habitual, the -- the term habitual residence and the use of the word habitual originated in the Hague Convention in French. And the English copy here is official, but, nevertheless, the term habitual residence began as -- I'm not even going to attempt to pronounce it in French -- but -- but habitual in that context translated means usual or customary.
It doesn't necessarily mean as a habit. And I think it's important that in the ordinary case, even an infant, as I said, I think, ask the parents of any newborn, and I think if you ask where do you usually live, they would have an answer, just like -- Well, does that mean Judge Boggs is right, that the place where an infant usually lives is the place where the infant has lived since birth with both parents? Judge Boggs may well be right, and he did add the qualification for absent unusual circumstances. Absent unusual circumstances, right. And -- and I think that's perfectly fine.
I think the problem, though, is if -- if there's any sort of guidance like that coming from this Court, lower courts will tend to rigidly follow it instead of answering the ultimate question, which you asked about earlier, which is, where does the child usually live? As a practical matter and as a -- you know, and in theory, the judge can consider facts that are relevant to that question.
And, of course, that itself is a constraint, and -- There's a -- there's a problem with your solution.
On the two questions presented, I take it you agree with Respondent.
But you said the bottom line should be a remand, not a determination. And this child is now four-and-a-half-years-old.
To remand to do what? What factor didn't the district court take into account that the district court should have taken into account? You say totality of the circumstances, not shared intent as a single factor, but it seems to me that the district court did have everything before it. What -- if -- if -- if we remanded, what should the district court do that it hasn't already done? So, Justice Ginsburg, we don't take a position on the outcome of this case.
The Court's usual practice, when announcing a new standard, is to remand. The only thing I'll say is that both the court of appeals and the district court appeared to view the facts through the lens of a -- a notion that shared parental intent was the only thing that mattered.
And probably the parties briefed the case that way in the court of appeals, all to shared parental intent. To the -- to the extent there are other facts that might have been germane to determining where the child usually lives that the parties didn't bring forward, you know, we -- we just don't -- What would they be? I -- I don't know, and it's hard to predict.
You know, I would -- as an example, I'll give you a -- a very recent case that's posted on the Hague Convention site that tracks cases under the Convention. It's called X against Y -- those are pseudonyms obviously -- from the court of appeals at the Hague.
Mom alleged that the apartment in the Netherlands was where they usually lived.
Apartment in Spain was a vacation home.
Dad alleged exactly exactly the opposite. The court had to decide who was right, looked at a lot of facts on the ground.
But the most compelling one that the court decided would tip the issue was that the mom had deregistered herself from the municipal persons database and put Spain as her forwarding address, and deregistered the company she ran from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. It's impossible to predict that that was going to be the fact ex ante.
But, when you're looking at where the family in that case or the child usually lives, it's the parties who are going to come forward with evidence, and the judge is going to assign -- decide whether it's relevant and, if it's relevant, assign weight to it. All right.
So -- so would you agree then with Lady Hale's observation in terms of a young child, infant and parent intent, shared parent intent, she says that these common-sense observations are best seen as helpful generalizations of fact which will usually but not invariably be true, not as propositions of law. So Hale -- Boggs may be right, except that he's calling it a proposition of law. I would agree with that. And I would just -- again, I would -- I would caution this Court from laying down principles like that because, when this Court says it, lower courts usually take it as proposition of the law -- Then why -- Well, then, if that's so, then is -- is it the less risky path to send it back? If we say it and don't send it back, more likely to be taken as laying down propositions of law? That may well be true, but -- What do you think? So we -- we -- we -- we don't take a position on it, other than to say, you know, ideally, this Court's opinion will say that habitual residence is a -- No, you don't have to take a position, but I find it rather difficult. So can you help me? (Laughter.) Again, as I said, it's -- it's where the child usually lives.
And with the facts we know -- I'm sorry, where did you get that standard? I look at the European court and it had a different standard. It says some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment.
That's the definition the Bates Court, Lady Hale, adopted. I think, once we say where a child ordinary live -- ordinarily lives, we fall into the trap that you had, which is, I think, courts will be focusing on ordinary out of context. Are you disavowing what the other courts are doing? No, we're not. If I may, Mr. Chief Justice. We think they are looking at the right question, which is where the child ordinarily lives.
In difficult cases, oftentimes -- No, that's a translation.
They didn't use those words. We -- we think the words they used are certainly relevant to that ultimate determination, and, in any event, that is what the text of the Convention says.
And we think that's what the Court should apply here. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Just to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's question, I -- I think the -- the European and U.K. courts have talked about the family and social environment in which the child's life has developed.
I think that, to me, is not that different from where the child usually lives. It may avoid the problem of duration. I think a lot of the problems in these cases sometimes result from the fact that habitual residence to a U.S. ear may connote some degree of permanence, but the courts, the foreign courts, have made clear that that actually isn't the case.
It doesn't require permanence.
It's -- it's just what's usual during the period before the allegedly unlawful return. We agree with the SG regarding the test.
And I just wanted to start by saying a few words about Petitioner's actual agreement test.
As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it would largely eliminate the Convention's protection for very large -- for very young children because they would have no habitual residence and because one of the spouses in the cases where there is marital discord during the pregnancy and the birth could simply say I withhold agreement on where the child should live, and that would mean there was no habitual residence as long as there was no agreement. That's obviously a significant gap. Petitioner cites some cases saying that a child may not have a habitual residence, but I think it's important to point out that those statements were made in a very different context, which is actually the one presented in the very large majority of decided Convention cases, and that's the situation where the child and the parents live together in country A, then the child moves to country B with one or both parents -- it could be a temporary stay with grandparents, could be for a job -- and then the parent who was with the child in country B says, I'm not sending the child back.
And so the question is, what is the child's habitual residence, country A or B? And courts have said in that circumstance it's possible to lose the habitual residence in A before gaining it in B.
Whether that's true or not, that's obviously a very different situation from the one presented here, where the parents are in one country and the child is born there and stays there until the challenged removal. And we agree with Judge Boggs as a factual matter, not as a legal principle, that those facts are very likely to lead to the conclusion that the child's habitual residence is that country, absent unusual circumstances. There can be different facts.
The child is born on vacation.
The child is born at a place of birth selected for medical benefits that were provided.
But that also makes sense. The reason for identifying the child's habitual residence is to determine which country should make the custody determination.
And if the parents of child -- and the child have lived in only one place, it's logical for that country to make the determination, again, absent unusual circumstances. Which -- which, as you say, is what Judge Boggs said.
And so I'm curious as to why you're not just accepting that as a formulation of the legal standard.
Judge Boggs was careful to say, absent unusual circumstances.
And I suppose I would say that the benefit of doing that is, you know, if you take the solicitor general's test -- this is on page 26 and 27 -- I'm not going to read it because it would take too long to -- (Laughter.) -- to do all the factors that they think ought to go into this inquiry.
And I'm -- I guess I'm a little bit afraid.
I mean, I -- I don't mind totality of the circumstances tests when they make sense, but I guess I'm a little bit afraid that by the time you get through all those factors, everybody's going to have forgotten what the ultimate question is. And if the ultimate question is just where does the child usually live, then why not just sort of say that when it comes to an infant or a very small child, the child usually lives where the child has lived with both parents all her life? Well, I don't want to resist a rule that would be beneficial to my client, but -- but I guess I will say that the -- the courts, especially in the U.K., have had a lot of experience with subsidiary legal principles like that being developed.
And I think the -- the result, and I think Chief Justice Hale mentions this as one decision, is that they do get too much credence in how lower courts approach the case. And so I think the danger of adopting subsidiary legal rules is that they will end up being applied, as the solicitor general said, in a broader sense -- in a broader context that -- than they should be. Wouldn't all the work be done on ""absent unusual circumstances,"" though? And so you would still have the out, as Justice Kagan points out, for people to argue that it's -- I think so, and I'm not sure, Justice Kavanaugh, that there's much difference between saying that as a legal principle or framing it the way Justice Breyer did, which is, when the facts are that the child has lived in one country with her parents for -- for her whole life, absent some unusual facts, that is going to lead to this decision. Well, what this ""take everything into account and be flexible"" standard seems to mean in practice -- and you tell me if this is wrong -- is there are a lot of different considerations and they may -- particular considerations may be more important in one case than in another case, so we're just going to dump this in the hands of a particular judge to make a decision that that particular judge thinks is fair in accordance with that particular judge's value judgments, and we're not going to make it -- we're going to make it very hard to get that reversed.
That's what this all seems to boil down to, with a lot of highfalutin language by the foreign courts. Am I wrong on that? I'm not sure that that's right, Justice Alito.
I think there is an ultimate inquiry: Where does the child usually live? Or -- or, in the European version, the -- the family or -- and social environment in which the child's life has developed? I think that gives you a north star. I think the problem is there are a lot of different facts in these -- in these cases. You know, it's one reason why, in family law, best interests of the child is a very broad standard because there are a lot of different facts. Yeah, but there I know what -- And so I think you can lay out -- I -- -- as we -- as this colloquy indicates, you can say, for example, when you have a -- a child who has lived only in one place, there is a pretty clear factual result that's going to obtain, absent something odd. The -- the difficult cases really are these multiple country cases.
Those are the cases where there are a myriad of fact patterns: Why did the child move? What were the parents' views when the child moved? Did the child get acclimated to the new country? Well, in the case of -- Those are very complicated cases. -- in the case of an infant, why does it matter that the -- the infant has lived all of his or her life in a particular country? That -- it wouldn't matter to that infant what country the infant was living in or whether the infant was living on the moon.
The -- the infant's world is the home with the parents or a parent.
So why does it matter? Well, it matters that the infant has lived in the same country with the parents.
That's the critical, I think, additional fact.
And I think -- But what is the interest that is served by that? The interest -- there are two interests that are served.
One is the theory of the Convention is that's the -- the -- finding habitual residence is important for two reasons.
One is to identify the place where the custody determination should be made, as opposed to leaving it to the unilateral decisions of one parent or another. The second is to deter these abductions, which are not only harmful in that they allow the gaming of jurisdictional rules, but they're harmful because they take the child away from both parents.
One parent is unilaterally taking the child away from the other. So you -- And so what the -- -- in this case -- and it's a troublesome case because she alleged that she was abused, so you're putting that mother in the position of, if she wants to escape domestic violence, she has to leave her child behind. Well, she doesn't -- she doesn't have to -- she can escape domestic violence by separating from her husband and staying in the country.
She -- before she left, she spent two weeks under the protection -- in safe houses under the protection of the mechanisms that Italy has for that purpose.
So I don't think that -- that the test requires that she stay with the husband. I think one of the unusual facts could be in a situation where it was clear that the abused parent wanted to get away, was determined to get away, and the evidence is the husband thwarted her at every turn. Now -- That's not what the district court found here, however, because the district court found -- and just to -- to quote two findings, on Petition App. 98a, she continued after the birth of her child to live in Italy and had no definitive plans to bring her to the United States until the last altercation, which precipitated her departure. And at 94a, most of the steps that Monasky took in March 2015 seemed to reflect a settled purpose and intent to remain in Italy at least for an undetermined period of time. So the district court looked at all this and said that wasn't the case here.
And I think those are actually factual findings.
That -- those aren't even mixed questions -- What do we do -- -- of fact and law. -- about -- I mean, I think in their brief they said she doesn't speak Italian and doesn't have a job.
And what do you do about -- and -- and this standard that I read, she didn't mention this, but it says you can't place the child in an intolerable situation. Well -- You'd think where the mother is being beaten up, that would be an intolerable situation. And -- What do you do if the mother is in a country where there are difficulties with abused women finding adequate care and she's got to get out of there? Well, I think that -- All right.
What do we do about that? As I say, I think that could be a -- a relevant fact that might lead the general rule that we're talking about -- Do we put it -- -- to be superseded. -- in here, or do you say in dicta or something that it was raised, an intolerable situation includes that, or do we say nothing at all? Well, there are two options for addressing that, right? One -- one is to say that, if the district court were to find that the mother was trying to get away and her -- she had a -- at the quickest possible moment, but she was thwarted because the father was preventing it through abuse or otherwise, then that might well mean that there's no habitual residence. That is not, as I -- the findings that I read, that's not the case here. You could also look to the Article 13 exception and talk about the possibility that -- that those facts may be relevant.
As I -- as my colleague -- But that -- -- noted, that was -- -- isn't Article 13 about abuse of the child? It is about abuse of the child, and so that is -- that requires a broader finding, that the -- so it may be that the -- the first approach is a better one. Can I -- Let me ask you a question about the difference between you and the government. You -- you, I thought, urged that shared parental intent is relevant but not dispositive, one factor among others to be weighed. But, if that is the case, doesn't that suggest the government's position, a remand, because at least the majority of the Sixth Circuit seems to focus on this shared parental intent? Well, let me -- let me answer that in two ways if I may, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, I think it's important to unpack the phrase ""shared parental intent."" I think the way the lower courts, as we discuss in our brief, the low -- the way the lower courts of the United States have applied that is what's the intent of each parent that can be proven by words, deeds, objectively, what's the -- what is the parents' intent with respect to the location of the child? That none -- there's perhaps one case in which a -- a federal court of appeals indicated that -- that a meeting of the minds might be necessary, and even that court relied on an alternative ground. So I think the -- the question is, is the intent of the parents with respect to where the child lives relevant? I think, yes, it can be proved they don't have to have jointly agreed.
They can each have the same intent. In terms of this case, I think, if -- if we prevail on the legal issues, then that issue is determined because there's no clear error in the -- in the district court's determination. So the question would be: Are there other facts that would be cognizable under the habitual residence standard that the lower courts didn't address? And our submission is those other facts are all facts that weigh in favor of Italy because they're principally the fact that the child has been located in Italy for her whole life before she was removed. And that's not something that was relevant necessarily to intent, but that's clearly a highly important fact that she was there with both parents. And so we don't see any other facts that could be adduced in this record.
The four-day trial was quite comprehensive.
We don't see any other facts that could be relevant that would require or even permit a different determination on -- on the habitual residency determination, which is why we think a remand isn't necessary. When you and, to the extent you know it, the SG, talk about totality of the circumstances, for older children, does that mean rejecting the view of most of the circuit courts that the key thing is acclimatization? No, I think acclimatization, as children get older, can be highly relevant.
And the -- the -- the courts that have adopted this test, the foreign courts have said that. I think the problem -- Well, but I think most courts have done more than just say that's highly relevant.
Most courts have said that's the question that we're trying to answer. And -- and that provides a kind of anchoring mechanism for courts, right? Okay, now I understand what the question is.
It's a kind of embeddedness in a particular country's life. So, you know -- but, if it's just like one thing that gets thrown in along with everything else, that seems sort of different to me. I -- I think the problem is there's no bright line between when you might think the young child standard applies and when you might think acclimatization becomes relevant.
There probably are crossing lines at one point.
It's really about the young child and -- and is he or she with her parents.
And then, at some point later, when the kids are 15 years old, it may be much more about them than about parental intent. I think most courts have been reluctant to say the parents' intent becomes irrelevant.
I think they -- the courts generally say acclimatization becomes much more relevant. So I wish I could help you with saying that -- that there's -- Isn't that what the European -- -- a dividing line there. -- isn't that what the European court said with respect to infants? It didn't say that you put parental intent or agreement as being the most important.
It used the word just an important factor I think was -- I think that's -- -- was their language. -- that's exactly right, Your Honor. So how do I discern that the mother's intent was to stay in Italy or that the child had acclimated to Italy or integrated into Italy when the child was being -- during those eight weeks, she was moved from one spot to another.
She didn't live consistently with the father.
There were separate -- Well, she moved between two places. Between two places, but the father wasn't in the first place.
Then the mother went for a couple of weeks with the father and then brought her back into the -- the shelter. The mother, I think, had some fairly potent evidence that she was making plans to leave Italy.
Everything about the entire situation surrounding this child was simply up in the air. Well, I think those -- sorry. So why couldn't a court reasonably conclude that no settled place -- Well -- -- no ordinary place had yet been formed for this child? That's a possibility we haven't talked about. But I have to presume that if we tell a court that it's the totality of the circumstances, that is, in fact, one of the options it has. I -- I think it is.
In this case, I think the -- the portions of the district court's opinion that I read on page 94a and 98a preclude that in this case because the district court rejected those -- that as the mother's intent. I -- I -- I think for the reasons that we've been talking about -- and I'd also say the movement from place to place is something that lower courts have rejected, if it's within one country, because the idea here is to find the country of habitual residence. And if those movements, the Second Circuit said, speaking through Judge Cabranes, if -- if those movements are within the country, they don't -- they don't really count with them -- when they're within two places. I -- I -- I wanted to mention the -- Justice Breyer raised a question about Italy and what the proceedings might be there.
There is a -- a proceeding in Italy, a custody proceeding, that a petitioner actually this past October has filed a custody petition. She filed some prior petitions.
They were rejected on jurisdictional grounds.
As I understand it, this petition is in the right Italian court and raises the custody question. But what about the -- the -- this ex parte declaration depriving her of her parental rights? That's still standing. I think that's one of the issues that will be adjudicated in this Italian proceeding.
And as -- as -- as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the current status is that the -- the legal custody of the child is with the Italian authorities. The father has generally physical custody.
The mother has visitation rights. There are periodic reports being filed by the Italian social services authority about what's going on.
So the Italian authorities are pretty seized of -- of -- of this matter. So just to -- to return to the -- the question of the -- of the remand, I think our view is, for the reasons I was discussing, that the district court's findings really deal with the intent issue, his -- his factual findings, let -- putting aside his ultimate determination on habitual residence. All of the other facts that could possibly be relevant under the Judge Boggs standard, framed as a -- a -- a -- a factual presumption, we think weigh in favor of Italy as the place of habitual residence. And we agree that -- that it would be great to cut off these proceedings.
Tomorrow will be the three-year anniversary of A.M.T. being returned to Italy, and it would certainly be good for the -- this uncertainty to be lifted so that she could then -- the Italian authorities could proceed with the custody determination without this issue being raised. And -- and I do think, as several members of the Court said, that there would be significant problems with the issuance of a re-return order, both in terms of a U.S. court's ability to issue such an order, given the equitable considerations, and also the extent to which such an order would be accepted by the Italian authorities. Unless the Court has any further questions, thank you. Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Tayrani. Thank you.
Three points, Your Honor. With respect to the standard applied by foreign courts to cases involving infants, I would point the Court to paragraph 55 in the European Union Court of Justice's decision in the Mercredi case. The Court there stated that an infant necessarily shares the social and family environment of the circle of people on whom he or she is dependent.
Consequently, where the infant is, in fact, looked after by her mother, it is necessary to assess the mother's integration in her family and social environment. That is the standard that Lady Hale adopts in the A versus A case at paragraph 54, sub (6): Applying that standard in this case leads to one clear inextricable conclusion, that Monasky was not integrated into a family and social environment in Italy and that, therefore, A.M.T. did not have a habitual residence in Italy. This Court need look no further than the parties' stipulation at JA 28 and JA 29 that, as early as August of 2014, Monasky was already laying the groundwork for her return to the United States by looking for U.S. healthcare and child care options, U.S. employment, and U.S. divorce lawyers. This Court need look no further than JA 200 and JA 217, which are emails between the parties sent in the critical days preceding and following A.M.T.'s birth, where Monasky reiterated her intent to return to the United States and to divorce Taglieri. And this Court need look no further than Pet. App. 94a, where the district court found that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible. That's precisely what she did.
The day A.M.T.'s U.S. passport arrived, when A.M.T. was eight weeks old, Monasky fled the dangerous situation in which she found herself and returned to the United States. This Court can and should make that determination and it should order A.M.T.'s return to the United States for a full and fair child custody hearing, which is the only venue in that -- in which that hearing can take place. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1432, Nasrallah versus Barr. Mr. Hughes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the jurisdiction-stripping provision in (2)(C), it expressly defined the key term ""order of removal."" It is an order that finds an individual deportable or orders deportation. A CAT order does neither, and the government does not disagree.
CAT relief is temporary, applicable only to the country where an individual is likely to be tortured or killed.
If CAT relief is granted, the removal order remains enforceable.
As the government says, ""a grant of withholding or deferral leaves the final order of removal undisturbed."" When Congress enacted (2)(C), it also stripped jurisdiction of expedited removal orders.
This is Section (2)(A), reprinted in the government's brief at page 4a.
It bars judicial review of ""any individual determination or any other cause or claim arising from or relating to the implementation or operation"" of an expedited order of removal.
That broader language expanded jurisdiction stripping beyond the removal order itself, but Congress did not use that broader language in (2)(C). If none of this carries the day and if some ambiguity remains, the presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative agency action would do the work.
Judicial review of administrative agencies is an essential part of the Constitution's separation of powers. Congress designed CAT relief to be available when all else is stripped away. Congress knowingly rendered those with criminal convictions eligible for protection from likely torture or death.
By its plain terms, 2(C) does not bar review of a CAT claim.
Ultimately, the CAT claim does not qualify as an order of removal. Again, the government doesn't contend that it fits within the clear statutory definition.
And I don't think it can, because the CAT relief comes temporally after in the proceedings the order of removal is entered. Do you agree -- That's both -- -- do you agree that, assuming that review of the -- of BIA fact-finding, assuming that it's available, wouldn't that review be highly deferential to the BIA? Yes, Your Honor, it would be for the substantial evidence review that would govern in circumstances when (2)(C) does not apply.
So I agree there is deference to the BIA.
But deference doesn't mean there's no judicial review.
It just is the appropriate deferential standard that would apply across the board of judicial review of administrative agency fact-finding. Do you agree that your CAT claim is covered by the so-called zipper clause? So I think there is an open question, Your Honor, if the zipper clause extends here.
Footnote 2 of Jennings suggests that the zipper clause might not apply in context of asylum, and I think this would -- would be similarly qualified.
But I'm willing to assume for a moment, even if the Court were to think that the zipper clause of (b)(9) applies to the CAT claim, I don't think that's any problem for our position. I think the zipper clause can be thought of doing two potentially different things.
The first thing it can do is, consistent with other provisions, both in FARRA and (a)(4), underscore that the various limitations of Section 1252 can be said to apply.
That's one thing. Well, what about the language of the zipper clause and a comparison of the language of the zipper clause with the language of the criminal alien bar? The zipper clause says that ""all questions of law and fact arising from an action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available"" -- and this is what may be important -- ""only in judicial review of a final order under this section."" So, if your CAT claim is covered by the zipper clause, that claim can be reviewed only in judicial review of a final order under this section.
And the criminal alien bar says that no court has jurisdiction to review any final order of removal. So, if you put those two things together, why isn't the conclusion that the criminal alien bar prohibits review of your CAT claim? So two things about that, Your Honor.
Let met say at the beginning this is not an argument the government advances, of course, so this is not an argument that the government has endorsed, and I think that's for good reason. So two points.
One, to say that this is part of the review of the final order of removal is not problematic for us.
We don't resist the conclusion that 2(C) applies.
The question is, what work does 2(C) do when 2(C) applies? And I'll unpack that for a moment. My second point, however, is that (a)(4) is later in time than (b)(9) of the zipper clause and it was specifically written because there was a jurisdictional gap that existed after FARRA.
In the REAL ID Act, Congress sought to foreclose suspension -- the Suspension Clause problem, which led to habeas actions in the district court, and it led to a broader provision in (a)(4) to ensure stand-alone jurisdiction. Well, and all this is very complicated, but I still -- I -- I don't know that that answers the question about what the pretty clear meaning of the statutory language is.
I mean, the zipper clause to me -- and you'll tell me -- these statutes are very complicated, so maybe I don't understand how they fit together, but the zipper clause seems to me the embodiment of the same sort of rule that applies in ordinary civil litigation with respect to a review of a final decision of the -- of a district court. So that -- you take an appeal from the final decision of the district court, but that permits review of everything else leading up to the final decision.
And the zipper clause seems to do the same thing.
It says that everything that arises in this proceeding is reviewable only in review of a final order of removal. So I think that's -- And so, therefore, your CAT claim is reviewable only in review of a final order of removal. So the title, again, is Consolidation of Questions for Judicial Review, and I agree with Your Honor that when the CAT claim occurs in situations -- circumstances where there is a final order of removal, if (b)(9) applies, it has the operation -- it's the same effect as (a)(4) in FARRA, to say those two things occur together. What happens is you get review of the final order of removal to the extent that review is allowed.
You also, though, independently then have review of the CAT claim. And I think the critical question is, what work does 2(C) do? 2(C) bars courts from engaging in the affirmative act of reviewing the final order of removal.
The key textual question here is, when 2(C) bars courts from engaging in that conduct, what is the conduct that 2(C) bars courts from doing? It's reviewing the final order of removal. And -- and nothing else? Not -- not all of the preliminary decisions -- all the earlier decisions that lead to the final order of removal? I think the merger principle this Court identified in Chadha is the correct one, which is to say anything on which the final order of removal is contingent would appropriately merge into that and be governed by 2(C).
So all of those preliminary things Your Honor references would be subject to 2(C). The ultimate question is a practical one, is -- is the nature of the argument in the petition for review, is it one that challenges the validity of the final order of removal? If the answer to that question is yes, it challenges the validity of the final order of removal, we agree 2(C) applies in those circumstances. The CAT order, however, does not challenge the validity of the final order of removal, and the government underscores that point.
They say, you win your CAT claim, the final order of removal is undisturbed.
That's because it's relief that is applicable only to one country, the country that's identified in the CAT order.
It's relief that's temporary; it can be undone later in time if, for example, country conditions change. And, third, the government says because that order, the final order of removal, remains presently effective, they can continue to detain individuals who've been granted CAT relief on the basis of the underlying order of removal -- It -- -- that the government says is -- Well, let me approach it one -- one other -- one other way.
And under the -- under the provision dealing with CAT claims, you can file a petition under 1252, right? Yes, Your Honor. And what is the -- what is the nature of the petition that you can file under 1252? There are two independent ways.
One is a Section 2242(d) provision under FARRA.
That was what was initially enacted in the 1998 enactment.
That is tethered into (a)(1).
It couples together review of the final order of removal with the petition for review of the CAT claim. That, though, led to a problem where, if there couldn't be judicial review of the final order of removal in what I would call a stand-alone CAT context or -- or where 2(C), this was prior to 2(D), where 2(C) would strip jurisdiction, there led to a problem where there would be circumstances in which FARRA 2242(d) did not supply jurisdiction. Now isn't it the case that the only kind of petition that you can file under 1252 is denominated a petition for review of a final order of removal? I think (a)(4), Your Honor, provides a separate basis for someone to file a petition.
That was the REAL ID Act solution to this jurisdictional gap I referenced, which led to habeas problems -- issues. And the text of (a)(4) provides that a petition for review -- and let me say off the bat there is some awkward language in here, but I think I'll explain why it's not so awkward in context.
A -- (a)(4) says a petition for review is ""the sole and exclusive means for judicial review."" A petition for review under 1252, it has to be under 1252? Yes, Your Honor. And you agree, I take it, that all of the requirements for a petition, including a CAT petition, that are set out in subsection (b) apply? All of those requirements apply? And, Your Honor, I'll say 2(C) applies.
I'll say everything in 1252 applies. All right.
If you say that all of the requirements in -- in subpart (b) -- in subsection (b) apply, subsection (b) sets out the requirements for a petition for review of a final order of removal. What happened, Your Honor, this -- I -- I -- I -- I appreciate this is a bit of a Franken-statute here, but Congress enacted (a)(4) after all of the requirements in (b) had already been enacted by AEDPA and ARARA. So what Congress did in (a)(4), which came later in time, by -- by referencing the section, I think it's fairly read to say we are putting (a)(4) in later and we're incorporating saying you can't get around the venue provisions or timeliness provisions or standard of review provisions by incorporating all of the requirements of this section. And, again, my point that I said a moment ago, I don't resist that we could say 2(C) generally could be thought to apply.
The question is when it applies to a petitioner, 1252, what work does it do? And the work it does is answered by the text of 2(C). It very clearly bars the act of reviewing final orders of removal.
It doesn't bar review of -- of -- of separately CAT claims. This -- Doesn't the CAT order at least temporarily invalidate the order of removal as to a particular country? No, Your Honor. At least in common parlance? I -- I -- I don't think it does because it remains effective and, if the CAT order is removed, the individual can still be sent to that country.
But, to get technical about what the definition requires under A-47, it's either the finding of an individual being deportable or being ordered deported.
Those are both binary determinations. Either the individual is found deportable or not, and either the individual is found removable -- order of removed or ordered deported or not.
And -- and, again, the government doesn't agree -- disagree with us. In the Guzman Chavez cert petition at page 10 -- they filed this after their brief -- they say, ""withholding does not address whether an alien is ordered removed."" It's the government's position that whether an alien is ordered removed, that binary determination, is made by the final order of removal, not the CAT claim.
So -- And can't -- What -- what -- sorry. Go ahead. What -- what -- two things here seem to be difficult for you.
I'm not sure.
You'll explain why they're not. In 1321, which is rather like the zipper clause, it says you can't review a CAT decision except as part of the review of a final order of removal. And then, in the two provisions, (a)(4) and (a)(5), it says continuously the review in accordance with this section.
Now, ""in accordance with this section"" in respect to, as you know, I mean, in respect to orders of removal means you can review facts, we have a mixed question in front of us, and not -- you cannot review facts for sure and, okay, and so why can you review here, particularly when it said earlier, and later in the zipper clause, you have to -- you -- you can only review this except as part of the review of a final order of removal? Well, if we have a fact argument, see, the judge made a mistake of a fact, you know you can't get that reviewed as part of a final order of removal review.
So how -- how can you say here they can? Well, so two answers to that, Your Honor.
The -- the second one, which I'll -- I'll get to, is the (a)(4) expanded beyond FARRA because there was a problem with FARRA.
But starting with just with FARRA, the except for as part of the review of. What that says is the way that you get review of the CAT claim is you have review of the final order of removal.
You have that. That's the (a)(1) 1252 petition.
And as part of that review, you have review of the CAT claim. What that doesn't say is that the CAT claim itself is the final order of removal.
All that does is, like (b)(9), the zipper clause, consolidates these two different sorts of arguments into the same vehicle, into the same petition for review. And they're -- I agree they're all subject to 1252 limitations.
But take, for example, the limitation in 2(B).
We agree the limitation in 2(B) applies.
That's the limitation that says that if there's a statutory conferral of discretion on the agency, there's no judicial review of that. It applies in this circumstance.
It just doesn't do anything because there's nothing discretionary about this determination.
That's the same argument we make with respect to 2(C). We don't resist saying that it applies.
It just doesn't do anything to the part of the petition for review that challenges the CAT claim. But my second point is, if the Court disagrees with that understanding of FARRA, and I think that's right, but that takes us to the jurisdictional gap that Congress found because we know that Congress in the REAL ID Act did not want courts entertaining habeas actions in the district courts.
It did not want the two layers of review.
It wanted these matters going to the courts of appeals. In order to ensure that there was not a jurisdictional gap, that's where Congress created (a)(4).
And when I was reading the language of (a)(4), it does have the sole and exclusive language, but (a)(4) is written in just the same terms as (a)(1). (a)(1) is the provision that the government points to as providing judicial review over the final order of removal. The way -- the language that (a)(1) uses is ""judicial review of a final order of removal is governed only by"" and then it cites the Hobbs Act.
It's a sort of curious way of conferring jurisdiction, not to say there is judicial review, but says judicial review is governed by the Hobbs Act. (a)(4) says the exact same thing.
It says judicial -- the means of judicial review is a Section 1252 petition. We think that (a)(4) confers jurisdiction in just the same way that (a)(1) does.
We know that Congress had to do this in order to fix the Suspension Clause problem that was at the heart of the -- the cases. You agree there's no review in the cancellation of removal context? The -- the -- Cancellation of removal. That's under the 1229(b). That -- so that is a 2(C) argument, yes, Your Honor.
That 1229(b) goes to whether or not there is a final order of removal entered.
If somebody wins cancellation of removal relief, that means there simply is no final order of removal, and that fits within the definition of A-47. And the denial of cancellation of removal? Yes, Your Honor.
So -- The factual -- the factual components of that? That is part of the final order of removal.
That is all well within because, if somebody challenges the denial of cancellation of removal relief, or for those who still have 212(c) relief eligible, any of those things, the upshot of their argument is the final order of removal that was entered against me should be vacated.
That's the relief we're -- How about statutory withholding, which is much more comparable to the withholding at issue here? I do think statutory withholding is the one thing in addition to CAT claims that probably our rule sweeps within. The language is less clear there.
There's not the (a)(4), the (a)(5) argument, and it's not before the Court.
But I do think the logic of our argument, the only thing in addition to CAT relief, I think it would -- So what work does (a)(4) and (a)(5) do for you? So (a)(4) and (a)(5) is decisive textual evidence in our view that Congress understood for purposes of Section 1252, that a cause or claim under CAT that's addressed in (a)(4) is simply not a final order of removal.
That's addressed in (a)(5). Congress, as I mentioned a moment ago, in the REAL ID Act, sought to ensure that all of -- review of all of these different issues would go straight to the courts of appeals.
That's why Congress created both (a)(4) and (a)(5).
It created two separate independent provisions that were next-door neighbors because it knew that final order of removal, as Congress used that language in 1252, just does not encompass a CAT claim. And I think that's the fundamental problem with the government's argument. So why does it encompass statutory withholding? Why does -- Why does it necessarily encompass statutory withholding? I -- I -- I'm not sure either of those arguments by their plain text encompass statutory withholding, Your Honor.
I think there is potentially a gap.
I think this is, to Justice Alito's point, (b)(9), the zipper clause, would tie in an argument about statutory withholding into the review of the final order of removal. Well, I agree with you that everything comes up -- under your interpretation, everything comes up to the Court.
That's what the zipper clause is supposed to do. What you're saying, however, is that because of the definition of what order of removal is, that if it doesn't affect the actual order, that's not barred, the factual review is not barred? That's right, Your Honor. Our -- our ultimate position is a straightforward one of, if the claim in the petition for review challenges the validity of the final order of removal, if it is -- and that is most things that are in a Section 1252 -- Like cancellation of removal, things like that affect that Act? Yes, Your Honor.
The only things that I'm aware of that do not fall -- that are not swept within that are CAT relief, CAT withholding, and CAT deferral, and, as Your Honor points out -- All right.
So -- -- statutory withholding. -- the -- in one of the briefs -- I can't remember if it was yours or someone else's -- there was a whole list of situations in which CAT claims would be reviewed independent of the petition for renewal -- independent of the decision on the removal. Yes, Your Honor. How would there be jurisdiction? I understood from your briefs that you think (a)(4) provides independent jurisdiction or (c)(4) provides independent jurisdiction.
How would it exist for statutory withholding -- So I -- -- in those similar situations where it doesn't come up with the order of removal? I -- I think statutory withholding is more similar -- is less likely to come up in an independent circumstance than CAT. So I'm not sure that those are going to arise as frequently -- Why? -- as -- That's what I don't understand. Well, I think the CAT, as being a final backstop, is the -- the sort of claim that is often seen more independently.
I -- I acknowledge, Your Honor, though, that in that -- that narrow range of cases about statutory withholding, I agree that (a)(4) doesn't apply. I do think that there is not a clear answer on where statutory withholding, the jurisdiction falls.
I think, though, it falls with -- most likely within (b)(9) because that is an order that then would be related to the proceedings and would be swept in together.
So I think (b)(9) would -- would do the work there. I -- I think ultimately, though, this has to be understood against the backdrop presumptions here.
One is that there is a presumption in favor of judicial review.
And, second, if there was no judicial review for the withholding context, if the statutes were understood that way, there would then be the Suspension Clause problem that would allow independent, stand-alone habeas actions to challenge the denial of the withholding -- What do you -- -- of the statutory withholding. Can I just ask you before your time expires -- and I -- I'd like the government to answer this too -- what you have to say about -- putting aside the question of waiver, about the Eleventh Circuit's holding that the criminal alien bar applies at all in this case, since the ground for removal in this case is 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), right, not -- Yes. -- (a)(ii)? So if -- if they're wrong on that, there's really no reason for us to get to this other issue.
And the second part of that question is, although they have said -- they have held that the criminal alien bar applies to an alien who has committed a crime of moral turpitude, why wouldn't that fall within 1182(a)(2), which is another -- Yeah. -- basis for the criminal alien bar? So, to the first part, what we do with that, two quick answers is, one, there's certainly no basis to -- to DIG or not -- this case or not resolve the question presented.
This is simply a second defect that's been found below.
The government's position should be waived if we're right about that.
That would just mean there's -- there's -- it doesn't -- it's not an obstacle to the question presented. I do think it is within the Court's discretion if it wishes to find plain error or to address the 1227 question in the alternative of deciding the question presented.
That's, of course, within the Court's discretion, but -- but it's not an issue that we've presented. As to Your Honor's question about why it doesn't fall within 1182, that's for two reasons.
One is the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit of Wanjiru.
1182 just is not applicable in these circumstances because it's about admissibility and it applies to criminal convictions that are prior to the alien's technical admissibility.
And the Seventh Circuit in Wanjiru explains that when the crime of conviction is post-admission of the non-citizen, 1182 doesn't govern in that circumstance.
That -- that's the Wanjiru analysis. Lee v. Gonzales, the Fifth Circuit, takes a different approach.
It also agrees that a single crime of moral turpitude is not triggered, and it focuses instead on the text of 2(C) because, when you look at the back-end portion of the text of 2(C), the language is a bit unclear, but it references that there are multiple crimes of moral turpitude in that 2(C), which is tying into the Romanette ii portion of the 1227, which says there has to be two or more crimes. So I think those are -- both the Fifth and the Seventh Circuit have provided two independent grounds for arriving at the government's position, which we agree with, that -- that -- that 2(C) shouldn't apply for the separate reason when it's a single crime of moral turpitude. Can you address the government's reliance on Foti and why that decision doesn't carry forward? A few things about Foti, Your Honor.
First, we think the holding in Foti is completely consistent with our position and with the -- The language in Foti. So -- so the only issue in the language of Foti where it does sweep more broadly, Congress defined the key term, ""order of deportation,"" after Foti, and it defined it in a way that's completely consistent with Foti's holding but is not consistent with Foti's broader language that absolutely anything that occurs in a removal proceeding falls within the order of deportation.
If we were with that one sentence in Foti that -- that reads more broadly, it could be a problem. But that's not the case.
Congress specifically defined the key term after Foti, and that statutory definition is necessarily what is going to govern here.
In Foti, the Court said we have to interpret what's an ambiguous term and we're going to resort to policy, knowing that there are multiple plausible interpretations.
Here, there's no resort to that sort of policy sense because Congress has filled the gap. But even if we look to that underlying policy, there, the policy was ensuring that there would be consolidation in one court so you wouldn't have some actions in the district court and some in the courts of appeals.
Congress has taken care of that policy issue, and now everything goes to the courts of appeals. And the final point about Foti is Foti was just picking where judicial review was going to be, not whether or not judicial review would be fully stripped.
This is a case in which jurisdiction -- is whether or not there is Article III jurisdiction at all, and that very strong presumption here was simply not applicable in -- in Foti. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guarnieri. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Section 1252(a)(2)(C), the term ""final order of removal"" encompasses the various administrative decisions that are made in the course of removal proceedings, including the denial of an alien's claims for relief or protection from removal. That has been the established understanding of the judicial review provisions of the INA since this Court's 1963 decision in Foti against INS.
And Congress incorporated that same understanding into Section 1252 when it enacted IIRIRA in 1996. Now the specific claims at issue here arise under the Convention Against Torture, but CAT claims are no different in this regard.
And we know that, in part, because, in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Congress specified that CAT claims would be reviewable only as ""part of the review of a final order of removal."" And because CAT claims are reviewable only as part of review of a final order of removal, they are subject to Section 1252's limits on final order review, including specifically the criminal alien jurisdictional bar in 1252(a)(2)(C). Petitioner's contrary view, which no court has ever embraced, rests on the premise that the denial of a CAT claim is not the same thing as an order of removal.
But the denial of a CAT claim is an integral part of the removal order for purposes of judicial review.
That is the lesson of Foti and its progeny, and that is the understanding of the statutory scheme that Congress incorporated into 1252.
And as I just explained, that's precisely how FARRA describes review of CAT claims. Petitioner's argument is also self-defeating, as we explain in our brief. Section 1252(a)(1) only authorizes the courts of appeals to exercise Hobbs Act jurisdiction with respect to final orders of removal.
If a CAT claim is not reviewable as part of a final order of removal, it is not reviewable at all. Finally, as Justice Sotomayor's questions illustrated this morning, Petitioner's theory can't make sense of the judicial review of claims for statutory withholding of removal; that is, claims for withholding of removal predicated on a fear of persecution rather than a fear of torture. Everything that Petitioner says about what makes CAT claims -- what makes a CAT claim distinct from an order of removal could equally be said for statutory withholding claims.
And yet, we know statutory withholding claims are reviewable as part of the final order of removal -- Counsel -- -- entered at the conclusion of the proceedings. -- two questions. Take them in whatever order you want or ignore them both.
First, what do we do with the fact that the government has repeatedly represented that a CAT order is not a final order of removal and that a final order of removal remains effective whatever happens to the CAT order? So that's one. Number two, can't something be part of a proceeding and yet be different from the -- one -- two claims can come in one proceeding, right, and we often have compulsory counterclaims, for example.
Why couldn't Congress want a system in which, for efficiency purposes, two distinct questions were presented to the court at the same time without indicating that they are the same issue? Well, Justice Gorsuch, if I may take your second question first, we think the language of FARRA is -- quite specifically identifies how Congress understood CAT claims to be reviewable in this context. The relevant language is reproduced at page 18a of the government's brief.
And as I quoted earlier, Congress specified that CAT claims would be reviewable only as part of review of the final order of removal, not as a -- a -- a separate proceeding that would occur at the same time as review of the final order of removal. I understand, exactly.
It's not a separate proceeding, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the same thing as a final order of removal, does it? Well, no, I agree with that, but the -- the -- Okay.
So you agree that -- that one can have two distinct things in a single proceeding? Section 1252 prescribes a mechanism whereby aliens can seek judicial review of what occurred in the removal proceedings by petitioning for review of the final order that is entered at the end of those proceedings. Since this Court's decision in Foti, the -- the uniform understanding of how judicial review works in this context is that, when the alien petitions for review of that final order which concludes the administrative proceedings, then the various other decisions that were made in the course of the removal proceedings are also reviewable as part of the final order of removal.
Foti described those decisions -- But you agree -- -- as an integral part. -- it's not the same thing as -- FARRA uses the same language. You'd agree that the CAT order is not the same thing as a final order of removal? It -- it -- it can be distinguished from the order by which the immigration judge orders the alien to be removed.
And as -- as Mr. Hughes has stressed -- Why isn't that the case? -- the order of removal remains valid even if the alien is granted CAT protection. Once the government concedes, as I think it must, right, that -- that a CAT order is distinct from, is not the same thing as a final order of removal, why -- why isn't that seriously problematic, turning to the first question I asked you? Justice Gorsuch, we -- we think it is part of the final order of removal.
It is an integral and constituent part of the final order of removal.
That -- Part of and integral to -- -- as this Court's Foti decision -- -- but distinct from.
How is that? It -- it is distinct from the order of removal in the legal sense -- Sounds pretty metaphysical, counsel.
I mean, it's -- it's integral to and part of but distinct from. Well, Justice -- It's like the Holy Trinity. (Laughter.) One could say -- Justice Gorsuch, one could make the same observation with respect to the review of final decisions of the district courts. In -- in the course of litigation in district court, a district court may make a variety of decisions that culminate in a final decision. The final decision under the -- the -- the statutory provision for review of final decisions to the district court has been universally understood that review of the final decision also encompasses review of the various decisions made earlier in the course of the district court proceedings -- Can I ask you a -- Well, but -- -- that merge into the final decision.
It's a -- it's similar scheme here. Go ahead. I -- I mean, I think that's very different.
All of those decisions are ones leading up to the final decision and the final decision is contingent on them. By the government's own practice and procedures, the CAT scheme does not have that relationship to the final order.
I mean, every time you issue a final order, or it -- there's the final order.
And when the -- the CAT question comes up, the government says: This does not affect the final order, which continues to be in effect. It -- it certainly does affect the final order, Justice Kagan, in this sense: To take this case as a specific example, Petitioner in this case was ordered to be removed to Lebanon.
His CAT claim -- the -- the -- the gravamen of his CAT claim is that he cannot be removed to Lebanon because he fears that he would be tortured there. If he were to succeed on his CAT claim, the order -- the existing order that he be removed to Lebanon could not be executed. Now there's still an order -- But the order is -- is for removal from this country.
And what the CAT claim does is essentially to put a kind of external constraint on how to implement that order. But the order, as the government repeatedly says when it does this, remains in effect.
The person is ordered to leave this country. Well, respectfully, Justice Kagan, the order is more specific than that.
And, in fact, the implementing regulations require that the country of removal be designated in the order. And if you look at page 47a of the Petition Appendix, there is an example of what these orders look like.
And you will find that in here the order specified that Respondent, meaning the Petitioner in this Court, be removed from the United States to Lebanon. Well, why is this -- why -- look, analogize it if you want.
Say it's just like a final order of a district court coming up for review.
Fine.
We've had a lot of those, all of us, enough to review in the court of appeals.
That doesn't mean you apply to the same standard for all of them. If it's a witness complaint, there's a credibility standard that's more -- almost entirely up to the district judge.
If it's a fact-finding, it's another thing.
If it's an application of law, it's another thing.
So fine.
It's part of the review of the final order. But, here, the question is, should they review facts? And that's a different section, which says you can't review facts in the final order.
And what they say to that is, look, if Congress wanted all these things to apply, it wouldn't have written two separate -- 4 and 5, they wouldn't have written two separate provisions. That's a pretty good argument.
And you have not a bad argument on the -- on the language.
I agree with that. So into this breach steps the presumption in favor of reviewability.
Now there we are.
And what do you -- what do you have -- I would like to hear what you have to say about that. Sure, Justice Breyer, we -- we have two responses about the presumption of the availability of judicial review. First, of course, we do not think the statutory text is ambiguous.
We think Congress unambiguously foreclosed judicial review of final orders of removal with respect to criminal aliens. Second, independently of that, we don't think the presumption in favor of judicial review can do any work in this case for the following reason that is specific to this particular case. The term the Court is being asked to interpret here is the term ""final orders of removal."" That appears in both (a)(2)(C), which is the limitation on final order of review, and also in (a)(1), which is the provision that affirmatively authorizes judicial review. And so a narrowing construction of the term ""final order of removal"" would sort of give with one hand and take with the other. Can I -- Why is it different from -- from what I've seen 10,000 times? In a court of appeals, we are reviewing a piece of paper called a judgment, right? And it is the order of that judgment that we review. But, when we review it, we have like 10 different standards that you apply to different aspects depending on what the argument is.
All right? Justice Breyer, when Congress enacted the criminal alien jurisdictional bar in (a)(2)(C), it used the term ""final order"" in the same sense that it used that term in (a)(1).
And under Foti and its progeny, that term encompasses the various other determinations made in the course of the same removal proceedings. Can I ask a -- It's true that -- We pledged -- we pledged to our treaty partners that we would not return a person to a place where the returnee would be likely subject to torture. Does that figure into this analysis at all in how you treat a -- a CAT claim, that we -- we have undertaken and we want other countries to undertake the same pledge, that people will not be returned to places where they're subject to torture? No, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think so.
The United States has determined that -- that Petitioner will -- is not more likely than not to be tortured if he is returned to Lebanon. The issue in this case is simply whether he is entitled to an additional round of judicial review of the agency fact findings, but -- Is -- is there any -- -- he will not be tortured.
That -- that is the determination that the United States has made. Is there any impediment -- and this -- this is very limited -- he can be deported any place else in the world, just not to Lebanon? Is there an impediment to deporting him to some other country? That -- no, there is not currently an impediment.
The -- the Immigration and Nationality Act itself specifies the other countries to which the alien may be removed.
There's an ordering in the statute about which alternative countries would be the countries of removal.
In a case in which the country of citizenship, he cannot be removed to the country of citizenship. Can I pick up on Justice -- Does it matter whether he's -- where his country of citizenship where he was born, where he has a residence? Would any of those apply to -- to Mr. Nasrallah? Well, I -- I don't know that there have been any administrative proceedings in this particular case to identify an alternative country of removal, but -- So it would have to be -- -- certainly, that would be in the analysis. -- a country that would accept him? Some country with which he has no connection would have to accept him. That's correct. That's correct. Can I pick up on -- If I can return to a point that I was trying to -- -- can I pick up on Justice Breyer's questions for a minute in thinking about how Congress structured this statute? The factual components of the order of removal often are not going to be seriously disputed because it will be convictions for prior offenses.
And you've gotten judicial process with respect to those state convictions usually.
And that was part of, I think, Senator Abraham's analysis back when this was put in. With respect to a CAT claim, however, the factual components will not have been previously litigated and, indeed, will be very important to the CAT claims. So why would Congress have wanted to preclude judicial review of those highly important factual components of a CAT claim? Justice Kavanaugh, the same could be said with respect to an alien's claims for asylum or to statutory withholding of removal.
In both of those cases, the sort of -- the factual predicate for the claim will not have been previously adjudicated in a criminal proceeding.
And yet, Congress unmistakably made a judgment that aliens who come to the United States and commit crimes should be removed from the country as expeditiously as possible. And as part of that judgment, Congress precluded review -- with respect to criminal aliens, Congress limited the review available of a final order of removal, which, as I have said, is a term that encompasses things like -- I just don't see -- Mr. Guarnieri -- -- claims for asylum and statutory withholding. I just don't see any language that says the factual components of a CAT claim, which, correct me if I'm wrong, but those are going to be highly important in a lot of these cases, that we, Congress, don't want judicial review, even the deferential judicial review that Justice Ginsburg identified, we don't even want that, of the factual components of the CAT claim? Well, of course, (a) -- (a)(2)(C) itself broadly precludes review at all.
And then Congress later added (a)(2)(D) as an exception to permit review of -- of questions of law and constitutional claims. Both of those provisions are written to -- to deny review of the entire final order, which encompasses things like -- Well, that just begs the question of whether that encompasses, as Justice Gorsuch says, the CAT claim.
But there's nothing specific to say as to CAT claims -- and this doesn't defeat your argument, but it is a problem -- there's nothing specific as to CAT claims that say we, Congress, don't want any judicial review of the factual components of CAT claims, which would have been a very serious decision. That is -- Congress never used those precise words, but in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Congress did direct that CAT claims would be reviewable only as part of the review of a final order, which, in turn, should be read against the backdrop of Section 1252 and Section 1252's limits on final order of review. Congress also reinforced those limitations in the REAL ID Act of 2005, which added -- Don't you think that -- -- subsections (a)(4) and (a)(5). Sorry to interrupt.
Don't you think part of that was meant to get everything straight to the court of appeals, as opposed to the district court, so that's what that was about? Yes, certainly, but this is a complementary part of the same project.
What Congress was intending to ensure here was that review of any CAT claims occur only pursuant to Section 1252 and subject to the limitations Congress had already specified in Sections 12 -- Section 1252. And I think FARRA is a problem for Petitioner here in another sense as well, and that is that FARRA, which was enacted, again, in 1998, after the statutory definition on which Petitioner now relies, FARRA clearly contemplated that CAT claims would -- could be reviewed as part of a final order of removal. That really makes no sense on Petitioner's understanding of the statutory scheme because Petitioner claims that there was a jurisdictional gap that Congress didn't solve until the REAL ID Act of 2005, when it added (a)(4) to the statute. But, in fact, we know from FARRA that Congress anticipated that CAT claims would be reviewed as part of final order review. No, it doesn't say that.
That's why it's difficult.
It says you can't review them except as part of the review of a final order of removal. And that means, I take it, that we don't really know, to be honest, whether, when you review this as part of the review of -- of the final order of removal, did it mean to pick up all the standards there in -- you know, that -- that applied to review of a final order of removal, or was it just talking about how you proceed, don't go to five courts, go to the one court and do it at the same time, you know, et cetera? I can't get clear in my mind -- and you have an interest in persuading me one way or the other -- which it really means. Justice Breyer, we -- we understand that to mean that Congress anticipated that CAT claims would be reviewable only as part of and subject to the limitations on final order review. That also was the administrative understanding of the statute.
The -- the implementing regulations in 1998 echoed FARRA's limitation.
And the preamble to the rule-making, the attorney general explained that she understood that CAT claims would be reviewable only subject to the existing limitations in Section 1252. So we think that the rule-making history also bolsters our understanding of the statute here. What was the nature of that review between 1998 and 2005? Because I'm a little murky on the chronology and how that would have worked in that -- those years. Sure.
So, with respect to non-criminal aliens, aliens for whom the criminal alien jurisdictional bar is -- was not a problem -- Let's talk about criminal aliens. Well, for criminal aliens, as a result of this Court's decision in INS against St. Cyr -- Before St. Cyr. Well, before St. Cyr, the matter was -- was somewhat unclear because, on its face, the criminal alien jurisdictional bar, as it was then written, would preclude review of all final orders by -- There would be no review at all, right? That's correct, including for CAT claims. And doesn't that pose a problem given that FARRA seemed to suggest that there would be some review? Well, but, for non-criminal aliens, there was -- review was occurring in the ordinary course.
An alien who had a CAT claim that was denied in removal proceedings would file a petition for review, and the petition for review would challenge the final order, including the denial of the CAT claim.
And the courts of appeals were reviewing cases like that. Now, for criminal aliens, the facts on the ground were somewhat different because the criminal alien jurisdictional bar precluded appellate -- precluded circuit court review entirely, at least for non-constitutional claims for criminal aliens. And so, as a result of this Court's decision in INS against St. Cyr, the courts of appeals determined that FARRA Section 2242(d), which is the provision I've been emphasizing this morning that makes CAT claims reviewable only as part of the final order of removal, courts of appeals concluded that that section did not itself preclude habeas review of CAT claims under the logic of this Court's decision in St. Cyr. Is this right? Now Congress -- Is this right? I'm trying to get this straight.
I'm just trying to get it straight in my mind.
All right? At one point, you had the section which says: Look, person under a final order of removal, if you're a criminal, you can't appeal at all.
And you also had the preexisting section that said to the CAT person: You can get review only as part of the review of a final order of removal. So, if you couldn't get it all, you couldn't get it here, it seems, because there was no part -- there was no final order of removal, so it couldn't be part of it. Then, later on, they had this other section say: Wait a minute, you can, Mr. Criminal -- and that's because of St. Cyr perhaps -- you see you can get review of a final order of removal.
And now we can get review of our CAT claim because there's something to attach it to. So the question is, did we, in fact, in saying that -- ""we"" being Congress -- mean that the condition that limits the final order of -- of -- of removal also limit the appeal of the CAT claim, which is no review of fact? And that's why they're saying it's a different thing; this was just a vehicle.
And you're saying: No, it isn't a vehicle; it's part of -- it's part of. Okay.
I got about that far this morning.
And that's why I got to then think, well, there is this presumption in favor of reviewability.
That's how I got there. I guess you could tell me, forgetting the reviewability presumption, am I right or wrong so far? Justice Breyer, if you examine the legislative history -- Was I right or wrong? Because I'm not asking for an argument.
I just want to know if my analysis is right -- We don't -- -- and if -- -- we don't agree with Petitioner's account of the history that led to the REAL ID Act.
According to Petitioner, in the REAL ID Act, Congress understood itself to be solving a perceived lack of jurisdiction in the courts of appeals to review CAT claims. That is -- that is unmistakably incorrect. If you examine the legislative record that preceded the REAL ID Act, what Congress understood itself to be doing was softening or limiting the scope of the criminal alien jurisdictional bar in order to solve the problems that this Court identified in St. Cyr. So Congress fixed the problem, as it were, by permitting review of legal claims and constitutional claims for criminal aliens and then amending 1252 in numerous places to make clear that there would be no habeas district court proceedings to review any of the determinations that occur in the ordinary removal proceeding and that 1252 would be the sole and exclusive means for aliens to obtain review of those determinations in the courts of appeals, including and subject to the limits set forth in 1252. Now, as I -- as I began to say earlier, we do think that statutory withholding of removal is -- is a very hard case for Petitioner here because everything that Petitioner says about why CAT claims are different than a final order of removal could equally be said for statutory withholding claims. And, of course, in Foti, this Court itself identified withholding of removal as the kind of decision that, when it occurs in the removal proceeding, is reviewable as part of the final order that's entered at the conclusion of those proceedings. Every court of appeals in the country was reviewing statutory withholding claims in the years post-dating Foti and predating IIRIRA. There is no evidence that Congress meant to eliminate or abrogate that practice when it adopted the definition in 1996 that -- that Petitioner has latched onto. We think also motions to reopen would not meet Petitioner's narrow understanding of what a final order of removal is.
When an alien files a motion to reopen the removal proceedings and the agency denies that motion to reopen, that is not itself a separate finding of removability or an order of removal, and yet it is unmistakably clear that the denial of a motion to reopen can be reviewed as part of final order review. This Court said as much in Stone against INS, and the text of 1252 continues to reflect it anticipates that there will be appellate proceedings with respect to motions to reopen. So we think -- The problem with -- -- that both of those are -- -- motions to reopen is that what you're seeking to do is to undo the order of removal, and so that fits quite clearly within your -- your -- the other side's theory. We still -- what you haven't told me is where the language of defining ""order of removal"" -- how I read that language in the statute? It's the first definition Congress has given.
Where in reading that -- those words when Congress has chosen to define them explains CAT claims, or can include CAT -- CAT -- CAT claims? We -- we think the language of 1101(a)(47) should be read in light of the -- the many decisions that preceded it, recognizing that -- The problem is -- -- final orders of removal -- -- that Congress had those decisions in front of it and it could have chosen to write something much more comprehensive, but it didn't. It could have said ""order of removal"" is any order of removal and all -- all other decisions encompassed by it or all other orders encompassed by -- a part of it.
But it didn't. It talked about it just as the order of removal. Well, we -- we think that language is naturally read to include the decisions that precede the order of removal. It's only naturally -- There's no indication -- -- read that way because we decided, I think it was Foti -- That's correct. -- that in terms of channeling review, we wanted everything channeled to the court of appeals.
This is a very different question than whether or not you're going to put in a bar that bars review altogether. Well -- Channeling and reviewing it, so Congress looked at it and said the one thing we're barring is only removal. Well, the -- the definition, it -- it defines a term that is -- appears not only in the provisions of the statute that limit review but also in the provisions of the statute that authorize review, as I explained earlier. Section 1252(a)(1) uses this term, ""final orders of removal,"" and there is no indication, and Petitioner has yet to explain why Congress would have wanted to, excludes statutory withholding claims -- Well, according to him -- -- from reviewability. -- according to him, maybe they didn't. Well, I -- I -- I don't think he's taking a position in your favor.
He's basically saying so what. Justice, I think in the reply brief Petitioner makes clear that if you accept his theory, that would mean that statutory withholding claims are not reviewable as part of a final order of removal. Now, in Footnote 7 of the reply brief, Petitioner has tried to hypothesize some other bases on which courts might be able to review those claims, but that would be a very startling development. Now, also, I think, the def -- Mr. Guarnieri, this not a case where we have to figure out the meaning of a term by looking to zillions of different statutory provisions and trying to make sense of them. This -- there is an explicit statutory definition here, and this statutory definition says what a final -- what an order of removal is. It says ""order of deportation,"" but nobody thinks that that makes a difference.
And it says it's an order that concludes that the alien is deportable, which you agree it doesn't do, and it concludes -- and -- or it orders deportation, which you also agree it doesn't do. So you're saying, well, even though there's this explicit definition here, we should look back to a bunch of cases that were decided before the statutory definition came about, that were decided before (a)(4) and (a)(5) came about, that even when they were decided the Court said that the language wasn't clear, and the only reason that they were deciding the case that way was because they had a policy concern about bifurcation, which doesn't exist anymore. So why would we look to those cases rather than the explicit statutory definition? Well, Justice Kagan, we do think the history that preceded this statute should inform the Court's understanding of it.
We are also pointing the Court towards the explicit text of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, which makes clear that Congress anticipated that CAT claims would be reviewable as part of a final order of review, which is consistent with our reading of the statutory definition but not Petitioner's unduly narrow understanding of that term. Now, before my time expires, Justice Alito, I would like to address the question that you posed to Petitioner's counsel earlier.
We -- we do think that Petitioner has waived any argument that the court of appeals erred in applying the criminal alien jurisdictional bar. In this particular case, Petitioner did not seek rehearing en banc on that issue.
Petitioner did not seek this Court's review on that issue. Now, having said that, we think the Eleventh Circuit's rule is incorrect and ordinarily a finding of removability under Section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) is not itself sufficient to trigger the criminal alien jurisdiction bar. But that's of no moment for the purposes of deciding this particular case.
We think the Court can decide the case on the premise, which Petitioner did not dispute, that -- Back -- back to the main argument, the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have adopted Petitioner's view of this statute, obviously, big circuits with lots of cases. Are you aware of significant problems in how they've been applying substantial evidence review to factual components of CAT claims or other problems that that's generated? Your Honor, the -- the -- the standard has made a difference in some cases in the Ninth Circuit.
There are -- there are decisions in the Ninth Circuit in which, in our view, criminal aliens were able to reverse the agency's fact-finding on appeal and circumstances in which the Congress -- the -- the statute should have foreclosed that kind of proceeding on appeal. We also -- Which way does that cut? If I may simply -- I mean, doesn't that suggest there, at least the courts thought there were mistakes being made in the administrative process in those cases? Well, it's true that there are some decisions in which panels of the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the agency fact-finding. But I will just add, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the rule that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits have applied is not the rule that Petitioner has advocated here and, in fact, he has abandoned the reasoning of those courts. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Hughes. Thank you. I'd like to first begin with a point that the government made about the notion that the removal order is limited to removal only to the country specified in the removal order. Respectfully, that's just legally wrong.
The regulation is 8 CFR 1240.12, subprovision (d).
It does state that an immigration judge needs to identify one or more countries to which removal is to occur. But the second sentence in that provision, and I quote, ""In the event that the Department of Homeland Security is unable to remove the alien to the specified or alternative country or countries, the order of the immigration judge does not limit the authority of the Department of Homeland Security to remove the alien to any other country, as permitted by Section 241(b) of the Act."" So there is no need to amend or alter the final order of removal in the event of CAT relief to -- to Lebanon, even though that Lebanon specified in that order the individual -- that DHS without further administrative action can remove the individual to any country that's specified in Section 241. The second point, the government's claims that were -- This is just curiosity to me.
Can the government change a port of deportation? Assuming a prisoner comes and says, my mother is in this other country, I'd rather go there? I -- I think there -- Do they have to go back to the judge to get permission to do that? No, Your Honor.
This regulation allows the individual to be sent to other countries in -- in the section, this is in 1231 or Section 241.
One of the countries that -- can be a country that the individual agrees to go to, I believe, and that is willing to accept that person.
So, if those things match up and they work with the government, that -- that can be. But it's all laid out, as Justice Alito mentioned a few moments ago, about the different countries and orders that are permitted by the statute.
Those are all swept within the order of removal, even if it says Lebanon on it by the regulation. The second point, the government suggests that we're wrong about the legislative -- or about the history of the REAL ID Act.
I think we're clear on the text of what (a)(4) does and explain jurisdiction and the clear purpose. But, again, the -- the argument about the history, I think, is a bit misplaced because, if the only piece of legislative history that describes (a)(4) is in the conference report, and the conference report says that its purpose was to ""allow aliens in Section 240 removal proceedings to seek review in -- in court,"" so the only snippet of legislative history that we have on (a)(4) says that the purpose of it is to create judicial review. The government's contention that we're just mistaken about the history there, I think, is a misplaced argument.
This is exactly what Congress sought to do. Now the next point, I think this is a pretty straightforward question of textual interpretation.
This -- in AEDPA, Congress stripped courts from doing one specific act. That's the act of reviewing final orders of removal. For all of the reasons we've described, Mr. Nasrallah does not ask the Court here to review the final order of removal.
He asks the Court to review something very different.
That's the CAT claim. We've described how (a)(4) and the regulations and the definition all confirm that this is not the order of deportation. The government's attempt here is to effectively back-door in through all of these various different provisions a broader effect of (2)(C) than what Congress actually wrote in (2)(C). But (2)(C) was pretty straightforward on its face because I remind the Court in A-47, that definition, order of deportation, was enacted by Congress for the specific purpose of defining the scope of (2)(C). Congress said in Section 440(a) of -- of AEDPA, we are going to strip jurisdiction for criminal aliens with certain convictions.
And in -- in 440(b), we're going to define the scope of that.
This is just simply outside the scope of the jurisdiction-stripping statute that Congress enacted as it defined when it engaged in enacting that -- that provision. But, next, if there's any doubt about this, if ultimately the Court thinks that these other provisions create multiple plausible interpretations of the statutory text, this is where the Court's strong presumption in favor of judicial review of agency action would do the work. Again, it's the government's burden not to show that there are multiple plausible interpretations but that its interpretation is the only correct one.
We think the text is unambiguous in our favor. But, if the Court disagrees with us, at the very least, there are multiple plausible interpretations, and, there, the presumption in favor of judicial review would do the work. And -- and then, finally, Congress purposefully chose to make CAT claims absolute. Congress -- this was a broad recognition to the horrors of torture. When there is an error in the administrative process, as the government just identified below, what that means is a court has found that the administrative agency made an error in finding that torture was not more likely than not. When there -- a CAT relief -- when CAT relief is granted, that means that there is a finding that it is more than 50 percent likely that the individual is going to be tortured or extrajudicially killed upon removal to that country. The United States has made a firm commitment that our deportation system is not going to be used to send an individual to a place where they are more likely than not to be subject to torture or deportation -- or torture or death. It is completely sensible that Congress did not extend (2)(C) to jurisdiction stripping in these circumstances.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1268, Opati versus the Republic -- Republic of Sudan. Mr. McGill. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Sudan provided Al Qaeda with a safe haven and vital material support enabling it to carry out the embassy bombings, killing 224 people and wounding thousands more.
In retaliation, President Clinton sent 13 cruise missiles into Khartoum.
But to impose punitive damages, Sudan argues, somehow would violate principles of fundamental fairness embodied in the Landgraf presumption. If fairness is the issue here, then Sudan surely should lose.
The State Department had designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993, but Sudan continued to shelter Osama Bin Laden even as he issued fatwahs calling for attacks on U.S. interests. In 1996 Congress enacted the Flatow amendment which, which explicitly provided for punitive damages for acts of state-sponsored terrorism. But still Sudan continued to harbor Al Qaeda. Sudan had ample opportunity to conform its primary conduct to U.S. law.
It just chose not to.
And that's not particularly surprising, because Sudan is a foreign government and foreign governments generally are not guided in their policymaking by changes to U.S. law.
The central rationale underpinning the Landgraf presumption simply is not applicable where the legislation is directed at foreign governments. But, ultimately, this Court need not decide here whether Landgraf or Altmann applies, because the first step in the analysis is to determine whether Congress has clearly defined the statute's temporal reach. And here it is abundantly clear that Congress intended punitive damages be available in two carefully defined categories of cases involving past acts of terrorism. In the subsection entitled, ""Application to Pending Cases,"" Congress set forth two categories of cases, prior actions and related actions, each of which were unmistakably directed at past acts of terrorism. Then the amendments say, in Section 1083(c)(1), ""The amendments made by this section shall apply to any claim arising under Section 1605A."" Congress had said prior -- prior actions and related actions could file under this new 1605A, and now Congress is saying the amendments made by this section shall apply to any of those claims. And Sudan concedes, at page 43 of its brief, that that meant all of the amendments in Section 1983 apply to a claim arising under Section 1605A. That language, ""shall apply to"" -- ""to any claim,"" is virtually identical to the language in footnote 8 of Landgraf, ""shall apply to all proceedings,"" that -- that Landgraf described as an unambiguous directive and that the Court later in Martin versus Hadix described as unambiguously addressing the temporal reach of the statute. In a case involving private -- a private defendant, rather than a sovereign nation, are there constitutional limits on Congress's ability to make punitive damages retroactive? Yes, I think under this Court's decision at least in BMW versus Gore, the Due Process Clause imports some idea of fair notice that would be applicable to persons, but foreign states are not persons within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, just as states of the union are not. So if we just apply the Landgraf test, what would be wrong with saying if Congress wants to make punitive damages retroactive, it has to say so expressly? There is a magic words requirement? That would be inconsistent with the -- how the Court looked at it in Landgraf.
The language in footnote 8 of Landgraf just roped together compensatory and punitive damages.
It -- actually, it didn't even reference either specifically.
It just said Section 8 shall apply to all proceedings pending on the date of enactment.
And Section 8 provided for compensatory damages and punitive damages. There was no magic words requirement applicable in Landgraf.
And this Court recognized -- but not -- not only in Landgraf, but later in Martin versus Hadix, that that was sufficient to unambiguously address the temporal reach of the statute. Is Sudan -- And -- -- simply wrong when it tells us, as it did in its brief, that the Court has never permitted retroactive application of a statutory authorization of punitive damages in any context? I'm not -- I'm not aware that Sudan is wrong as to what it said, but the Court was very clear in Landgraf that if the 1990 bill had been enacted, that would have been sufficient.
And that bill is no more or less clear than Section 1980 -- Section 1083(c) as enacted by Congress in 2008. It says -- the language is almost exactly the same, ""shall apply to all proceedings"" versus ""shall apply to any claim."" And Sudan concedes, it's important to note, that every single word of Section 1083 applies retroactively, except the two words ""punitive damages."" There's no -- there's no application of the Landgraf presumption that works in that way.
That's -- there's no textual basis for extracting punitive damages from the rest of Section 1083. Mr. McGill, is it really right that it does -- all the rest of it does apply retroactively? And I mean that in this sense, that under the old statutory scheme, 1605(a)(7), wouldn't a person have been able to get compensatory damages and all the other damages anyway? So that the only new thing that was added by way of this creation of a cause of action is the punitive damages.
So I guess that would be a reason to think of the punitives, separate and apart from all the rest, as retroactive. No, it's not correct, Justice Kagan, because as part of -- part of the rationale for Congress enacting a federal cause of action was that the Court in the Peterson case involving the 1983 Marine Corps barracks bombing, it held that persons -- family members proceeding under Pennsylvania law and Louisiana law had no -- had no remedy because the state -- the state law didn't permit for intentional infliction of emotional distress for persons not present at the scene of the bombing. So -- so Congress enacted -- in the federal cause of action, it -- it created a remedy that did not otherwise exist for compensatory damages in that limited instance, at least. I would point to -- Well, I guess -- I mean, it definitely created -- maybe I'm not -- not understanding the answer.
It definitely created a cause of action, but in what circumstances is that cause of action different, putting aside punitive damages, than the state law claims that would have been brought? A -- a family member who was in Pennsylvania -- who lived in Pennsylvania, for instance, had no claim for compensatory damages under -- Because? By dint of Pennsylvania state law.
That just -- that that -- Pennsylvania state tort law did not allow that person to recover.
Same for Louisiana. And this was, you know, Judge Lamberth in the Peterson case expressed some regret about this. Got it. But -- but -- so that was part of the rationale for the federal cause of action. Got it. There are two, at least two other points that I think demonstrate Congress's clear intent that punitive damages apply retroactively. First is the prior actions provision, which for qualifying cases provided not only that an action could be restored under the new Section 1605A but also that the judgment itself shall be given effect as if it had been originally filed under 1605A(c). And prior to 2004, many courts in D.C. had awarded punitive damages in cases under the Flatow Amendment.
One of those cases was a case called Acree versus Iraq that this Court addressed in Iraq versus Beaty, it was a 959 million dollar judgment that included 300 million dollars of punitive damages. And then President Bush's veto statement, which you can find at the blue brief at 17(a) complains that this -- that the legislation that Congress had enacted would revive a 959 million dollar judgment against Iraq for the misdeeds of Saddam Hussein.
That is an unmistakable reference to the Acree decision. And what Congress did in response was not change anything with respect to the retroactivity of the cause of action or retroactivity generally or to punitive damages specifically.
It instead gave the President waiver authority solely with respect to Iraq. It demonstrates that the President knew that this statute provided for punitive damages to apply retroactively, and Congress's reaction to that was to say yes, we want -- we want punitive damages here to apply retroactively. An additional point I would make that's related is that under the Flatow Amendment, ever since its enactment in 1996, it had always been applied to allow for punitive damages for past acts of terrorism, including in the case involving Lisa Flatow herself. There is just no reason to think that Congress in 2008 wanted to narrow the relief that had been available under the Flatow Amendment.
This was instead, if you look at the history of how Congress has dealt with the terrorism exception going back to 1996, it is consistently an effort to expand, not always perfectly effective effort, but it's an effort to expand the relief available to victims of terrorism. There's no reason to think that after enacting the Flatow Amendment and providing punitive damages that looked backwards, that now Congress would provide a different punitive damages remedy that looked only forward. It also, of course, would ignore the acts of terrorism that were most in Congress's mind at the time, which included, of course, this bombing here. One additional point I could make that further demonstrates that this would apply retroactively is the operation of the related actions provision.
And as the D.C. Circuit recognized in an opinion by then Judge Kavanaugh, the -- that related actions provision allows a person who already has a judgment for compensatory damages to file a new action under the new federal cause of action to seek punitive damages. The only reason Congress would allow somebody to bring a second cause of action arising out of the same act of terrorism would be to allow that person to provide -- to get the punitive damages that Congress, once again, was attempting to provide. So you have the text of the statute, the history of the statute, and the context in which it arose, all here together, work -- work together to persuasively demonstrate that Congress wanted punitive damages to apply to past acts of terrorism. Sudan, again, concedes that the federal cause of action for money damages applies retroactively.
They concede that the federal cause of action for solatium, for pain and suffering, and -- and economic damages all apply retroactively. This is an aside of the issue here, but I have not seen the term ""solatium"" as a -- as an item of damages before. Where does that come from? I don't know where it comes from originally, but it -- I think it -- it refers to the -- the emotional suffering of an aggrieved family member who is not themselves directly -- that -- that the injury that, for instance, a spouse suffers from have -- from viewing their -- their spouse or their -- their other family member suffering through an injury. What about the retroactivity of punitive damages under state law? So I think there, if the Court agrees with me that -- that the federal remedy -- that the punitive damages applies retroactively under the federal cause of action, then the state law cause -- then it applies -- the D.C. Circuit's decision with respect to state -- the state law cause of action really collapses. The D.C. Circuit's primary rationale was that it would be inconsistent to allow state law punitive damages and not -- if you had already decided that the federal law doesn't, you know, doesn't provide for punitive damages, and it was that -- what it said, inconsistent outcomes at page 129 of the petition appendix that really drove the decision. Two additional points I would make is, first, the D.C. Circuit recognized that without the Landgraf presumption, then the amendment would have lifted the restriction as to state law punitive damages.
So if you agree with us and the government that Altmann is the right framework as to which to -- to look at the state law issue, then under the D.C. Circuit's own rationale, the state law punitive damages should apply. And I guess the third point I would make is that once you acknowledge and concede that these state law claims are brought under Section 1605A, and -- and it should be emphasized that Petitioner's claims here have only ever been claims under Section 1605A. They all were filed after the enactment of this statute originally.
So once you concede that the actions are under 1605A, Section 1606 has no application to them.
The 1606 bar on punitive damages, as the D.C. Circuit says, at 128A of the petition appendix, it has 1606, therefore, has no bearing upon state law claims brought under the jurisdictional grant in Section 1605A.
That is us.
That is our claims. And if they -- without Section 1606, there is no other textual basis to bar punitive damages of a state law claim.
There is no -- there is no free-floating preemption of state law punitive damages that could be invoked. So I think if you agree with us about the federal law cause of action, then the state law cause of action goes with it. If there are no further questions. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: If I could start this morning with Justice Alito's question about a magic words requirement, we of course agree with Petitioners that -- or with Petitioners that Landgraf doesn't require that.
And I think it's very important on page 272 of Landgraf where the Court explains exactly what it is doing. It states that: ""Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits."" I think that that is exactly what happened here for all of the reasons that Mr. McGill has already explained.
We have a statute where Congress in the first instance says under 1605A(c) that punitive damages will be available in a laundry list of damages that it specifically identifies. It then goes in Section 1083(c), and this is on page 26A of our appendix, through the actions that will be brought under 1605A, it explains that the amendments to Section 1605A will apply in any action, and it provides for prior actions that are related to previously-filed actions, so actions that are necessarily dependent on pre-enactment conduct, to be brought directly under Section 1605A. If Landgraf -- I don't -- -- is -- if Landgraf is a sort of substantive interpretive canon that is based on constitutional concern, why would it apply at all in a case involving a foreign sovereign? And if it's not such a substantive canon, it would have to be an interpretive canon that Congress generally doesn't want to impose liability retroactively on a foreign state. Would there be any basis for that? So I think it is a canon of congressional intent.
I don't know that it's as closely tied to or limited to constitutional concerns, so much as simply a concern that when -- generally when Congress acts in a substantive manner, we think that it does so prospectively. And I think if -- if you thought that it simply had no application to foreign sovereigns, I think Altmann would have been written very differently.
I think page 695 in footnote 15 of Altmann make very clear that the Court, while considering Landgraf not particularly appropriate in the context of foreign sovereign immunity and related issues that were then part of the FSIA, very clearly and self-consciously carved out situations in which you are imposing new liability for the first time. And this actually takes me to Justice Kagan's question, which I also was hoping to address.
The -- it -- it is true, as Mr. McGill points out, that the compensatory damages were not available for all victims under prior law. I think it's also important to note that I don't read Landgraf as asking necessarily whether any other source of law would have provided for that same set of damages.
I read it as asking whether this federal cause of action in that case and -- and here would provide for that type of liability. And I think that's important because you can imagine in a case, particularly in a case involving a foreign sovereign, where you would then have to do that analysis across many, many different types or bodies of law across different countries, as well as in the state and the -- the federal context. It's also not clear to me -- and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's question -- whether types of damages that are specifically enumerated in 1605A(c) like solatium necessarily would have been available under state law previously.
And so no one has sort of done that analysis.
And I don't think that's necessarily the right way to think about the question here. I think the -- the back-and-forth between Congress and the President that Mr. McGill mentioned earlier is extremely important here for two reasons.
One, of course, is that, as Mr. McGill noted, it's very, very similar -- the language here is very similar to the prior bill that Landgraf had discussed.
And so I think we can sort of take note of that. Obviously, Landgraf also, by looking at that prior bill and the veto of that prior bill, sort of provides a guidepost that that is the -- the correct type of history to look at in this clear statement inquiry. Ms. Ross, I'm -- I'm trying to process everything you've just said -- Sorry. -- but let me break it down in a more direct way. Sure. Your colleague said that we don't have to get into the Landgraf/Altmann issue, that we can just see the plain language of the statute and say whatever -- however we look at it through the Landgraf lens or the Altmann lens, Congress was clear: Punitive damages apply retroactively in this case. Do you agree with that proposition? I do, Your Honor, with respect to the federal aspect. All right.
Now we go back to what Justice Alito asked you, and I want to clarify what you think the answer is to this. Assuming it was a little less clear, are you saying Altmann -- Altmann would say that there is no presumption in a case involving foreign sovereigns, that Landgraf is only a presumption that applies to private rights, not to actions against foreign sovereigns? No, Your Honor, we think that Landgraf would apply.
We just simply think that it is satisfied here. And, again, I apologize if I have -- I'm sorry, I know your adversary takes a different tact.
So I wasn't sure.
Okay. Correct. Yes. Petitioners think that you can apply Altmann across the board.
We do think that Landgraf is the right framework for the federal cause of action, although we think Altmann is the correct -- You -- you don't -- you don't believe that it's only to private rights; you believe it's to any retroactivity questions? Well, no.
I mean, of course we would -- we would carve out Altmann itself, which was a retroactivity question. But on immunity? But on immunity.
Exactly, Your Honor. All right. And we think that that's why Altmann, in fact, applies to the state law claims, because all Congress did with respect to the state law claims was adjust the extent to which United States courts are open to plaintiffs with preexisting claims.
That's the language that Congress used, essentially, to describe the then current state of the FSIA in 2004, and we think it's still true with respect to the state law claims today, because plaintiffs would be proceeding, obviously, under state law and so section 1605A(a), which is the -- the exception to foreign sovereign immunity, and section 1606, which is the provision that previously barred punitive damages, neither of those create liability for punitive damages in the first instance. Again, they simply alter the extent to which plaintiffs who otherwise could obtain that remedy in -- under state causes of action can do so in federal and state courts following the 2008 amendments. If Congress thought that a particular country was an incorrigible sponsor of terrorism and it wanted to punish that country, would there be any constitutional barrier to Congress simply expropriating all assets of that country within the reach of the -- of the United States? Your Honor, the United States hasn't taken a position on the scope of a foreign state's constitutional rights in this case.
Sudan hasn't raised that issue.
Sudan has asked, like any other litigant, for application of the Landgraf presumption.
It has not suggested that there would be some particular constitutional violation as to it. I think, particularly in this context, where we have a narrow provision focused on state sovereign -- or state sponsors of terrorism that have been designated as such based on a congressional -- several congressional statutes that permit that designation, and then an executive determination about their sponsorship of terrorism, there really aren't any constitutional issues in this case. But you think that Landgraf applies in exactly the same way to a claim by -- when the -- when the defendant is a foreign state as it does when the defendant is a private party? I think that, again, we -- we haven't had a need to address that here because I think Landgraf requires that Congress be clear.
I think for the textual and contextual reasons that have already been discussed this morning, Congress was exceptionally clear. I also think that that is -- the -- the notion that it would apply in the same way or at least that it does apply to this very narrow circumstance of the creation of a new cause of action against a foreign state is a pretty clear sort of lesson from Altmann itself. And, again, Altmann having been very clear to carve out the situation in which a new cause of action is created, obviously there, it was thinking about foreign sovereigns more generally. I mean, is the idea that if a -- if a foreign state is going to sponsor terrorism, it might think, well, you know, if we're going to be liable for compensatory damages, it's worth our while, but if we're going to get hit with punitive damages, well, that's going to stop us? Is that the -- the thinking of the U.S. Government? I don't think that that's the thinking of the U.S. Government, Justice Alito.
I think what -- what is the thinking of the U.S. Government is twofold. One is that Landgraf, I think, doesn't just apply in situations -- and some of the subsequent decisions actually make this clear -- it doesn't just apply in situations where someone is sort of consciously thinking should I take this act or shouldn't I.
It embodies a more baseline fairness expectation, an expectation simply about how we think Congress thinks about these issues. We generally think that when Congress legislates, it does so prospectively.
And so if it's going to do so in a way that really affects substantive liabilities, it should be clear, and we think, again, here, it was quite clear, and we think that that's enough to resolve this case on -- as I said, on the federal cause of action. And then, on the state cause of action, we think that clearly falls under Altmann and, for the reasons provided, we -- we think satisfies that more lenient test. If the Court has no further questions, we would ask that you reverse. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Curran. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First, a response to my friend Mr. McGill's opening histrionics, I note that the D.C. Circuit concluded that the -- that the evidence at the default hearing failed to show that Sudan either specifically intended or directly advanced the 1998 embassy bombings. The D.C. Circuit also acknowledged that Sudan expelled Bin Laden permanently in 1996, May of 1996, two years before the U.S. designated Bin Laden and Al Qaeda as terrorists. So I think that some of Mr. McGill's comments have some selective 20/20 hindsight aspect to them. Now -- but is that before us? I'm just responding to the -- the argument that Sudan is the devil incarnate here.
I -- I think instead the record shows that Sudan, at most, was negligent in controlling people within its borders and that it's not -- and I want to make it clear that Sudan did not and is not accused of being a terrorist, but instead providing an environment that allowed terrorism to foster, again, long before Bin Laden was a notorious terrorist. Now, before I turn to the retroactivity issues that are before the Court, Justice Ginsburg, one comment about the state law claims that Justice Alito raised. The state law claims are all brought by foreign national family members, so those -- that's citizens of Kenya and Tanzania.
They're all for claims of emotional distress felt by those plaintiffs.
These are not representative claims of any kind. Now, those claimants acknowledge, they concede that they are not eligible for the cause of action under 1605A(c) because they don't have the sufficient U.S. nexus; they're not U.S. nationals, they're not U.S. employees, they're not U.S. contractors, and they're not representatives of those. So -- But their decedents were? But their decedents were. But these are not claims on behalf of the decedents.
These are claims for the emotional injuries of these foreign family members themselves. So if they're not eligible under 1605 capital -- 1605A(c), under the cause of action, they are also not eligible under the exception to immunity because that's got parallel, almost identical, U.S. nexus requirements. The bottom line is there's no subject matter jurisdiction as to claims by foreign national family members seeking redress for their own emotional injuries. So if the Court were to expand the question presented, as my friends suggest, the -- the conclusion should be that those state law claims cannot withstand scrutiny under subject matter jurisdiction. Now, turning to the key retroactivity point, here our position, of course, is Landgraf controls this case.
Altmann is not on point because when Altmann was decided, the FSIA was strictly a jurisdictional statute, essentially. I do know it was complicated by the Verlinden decision, which said it established some substantive aspects of federal common law. But, in any event, Altmann was limited to the FSIA as it existed at the time, and that was pre-2008. Footnote 15 of Altmann and the text accompanying that specifically say that we're not dealing here in Altmann with a cause of action, the creation of a cause of action or the modification of a cause of action, because if we were, we'd have to be concerned with Landgraf and Landgraf's progeny, including the Hughes case. Well, Mr. Curran, assuming Landgraf controls, why isn't it met here? I mean, you've conceded that every other part of this statute applies retroactively. So how is it that you can exempt punitive damages from that retroactive coverage? Okay.
There's a lot to that question.
And I -- and I -- and I have an answer for all of it.
First, with respect to your earlier point, yeah, we do concede that the compensatory damages and other -- certain other aspects of relief, including solatium, those -- those do apply retroactively but not because there's a clear statement by Congress that those should apply retroactively. It's because there was no change, no substantial change.
The -- the foreign states were already subject to compensatory damages and solatium.
And -- Well, Mr. McGill said sometimes there was.
And -- and it would be a matter of state law.
You would have to go state by state and see what a particular state law had allowed and what it didn't.
And that couldn't be what Congress had in mind, is, I think, Mr. McGill's and Ms. Ross's argument. Right.
So Mr. McGill identified two states, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, that don't provide for IIED claims, emotional distress claims for non-present family members, okay? So those are two outlier states.
I'm not aware that we have got any plaintiffs in this case from Pennsylvania or Louisiana. And -- and, furthermore, that's secondary. We -- our position is the family members don't have a claim at all before or after the 2008 amendments. But, Mr. Curran, just to try and pursue this question a little bit further, I -- I thought you had conceded as well that 1605A's cause of action applies retroactively, the federal cause of action -- Yes, yes. -- does. Because -- Okay.
And that's a new cause of action, you'd agree, right? Well, it's new as a matter of federal law. Right.
That's -- that's how we usually define causes of action is, you know -- Okay, but -- -- is there a source of law that provides -- -- there is a point. May I finish, please? I'm sorry. That's all right. So, and -- and this is just the heart of the matter.
And -- so take your time with it.
And -- there is no rush. But I think this is the heart of the matter for me, and it sounds like it may be for some of my colleagues.
If we agree that the cause of action is a new one and applies retroactively, and if we agree that compensatory damages apply retroactively, on what account does it make sense to speak of punitive damages not also applying retroactively, given that it's authorized by the same statute? Yeah, the answer to that lies in this Court's analysis of the Bradley case, within Landgraf and within Altmann. Okay, Bradley was a case where there were -- there was an entitlement to attorneys' fees under common law. And then a statute was passed authorizing attorneys' fees.
And the question was: Well, should that new statute apply retroactively or not? No clear statement by Congress.
But different regimes. And the Court concluded, this Court concluded that we're going to apply the statute retroactively because there's not really a -- a retroactive effect for -- for the passage of that statute because attorneys' fees were already available under common law.
So -- Right.
Let's say I don't buy that argument, and if mere fact that there were state causes of action doesn't move me very much. And I'm still here, though, on -- on a record in which everyone agrees that the federal cause of action does apply retroactively.
Then what do I do? Well -- well, I might change my concession as to the federal cause of action, if -- if the state -- if the prior state cause of action was -- Can we do that -- -- irrelevant. -- at this stage, Mr. Curran? Well -- well, I don't know.
But under -- and I don't know if this is directly responsive to your question, but there's no clear statement here as to retroactive effect of any of this stuff in 2008. So my friends point to 1083(c) and its provisions on pending cases.
Well, this is an important point to make.
None of the cases we're talking about here today were pending at the time two -- the 2008 statute was enacted. As we say on page 13 of our brief, three of the cases were filed in 2008, after the 2008 enactment.
And the fourth case, the Opati case, which we referred to on page 14 of our brief, was filed in 2012. So none of the cases at issue in this case were pending cases.
So I submit -- I thought you were really -- I thought it was a given that you were contesting the retroactivity only of punitive damages, not the basic cause of action, not the compensatory damages, not pain and suffering, not solatium, I -- and now you seem to be waffling or reneging on that concession. No.
So -- so -- so here -- here's my analysis, right? Landgraf first asks did Congress specify clearly whether there's retroactive effect or not? If Congress has said so, we apply that.
But if Congress hasn't said so, then the next step in the Landgraf analysis is: Well, we have to take a look and see whether this new provision has a retroactive operation. Does it upset settled expectations? Does it impose new damages? Does it impose a disability to use Justice Story's terminology? And -- and in -- in the -- with respect to compensatory damages and with respect to the cause of action, with all due respect to Justice Gorsuch's disagreement on this point, those -- those things existed before the 2008 enactment. Well, we often say there's a state tort cause of action, that doesn't necessarily mean there's a federal civil rights cause of action, right? True, but here there's no space between -- So, hey, federal law can provide the exact same remedy that state law can.
That doesn't mean they're the same cause of action, does it? Well, I think under Landgraf and under Bradley, what we look for is the practical consequences.
Is there fundamental unfairness in implying -- in applying retroactively the new provision? And here there's not, as to compensatory damages and the cause of action. I don't know where your argument based on these state claims is going.
Suppose that there was no federal cause of action for something, but there was a state cause of action for exactly the same thing. And so now Congress passes a statute that creates the federal cause of action, which is exactly parallel to the preexisting state cause of action, but says nothing whatsoever about retroactivity. Would you say that there is no retroactive effect in the case of the federal statute because you -- you were already liable under the state law? That's exactly what I'm saying, yes.
There's -- there's no -- I think you're arguing in exactly the opposite direction.
So you would say there is no retroactive effect under the state -- under the federal -- we would presume that there would be no retroactive application -- that there would be -- No. -- no problem with retroactive application of the federal claim because you were already liable under the state law. Right, that's the proper application of Landgraf.
In -- under Landgraf the presumption against retroactivity doesn't kick in, unless the new statute has a retroactive effect.
That has to operate retroactively. There has to be prejudice to the subject of the statute before the presumption kicks in. Well, what -- Suppose you're right. -- does that mean we have -- Suppose you're right that -- I mean, we take all this, you say, look, go read 160- whatever it is, whatever it is -- (c)(2), and it says, with respect to any action that was brought under 1605(a)(7), on motion, the judge -- it's -- shall -- it's treated, it shall be given effect, as if the action had originally been filed under 1605A(c). Now, when you look at the effect, as if it had been brought under 1605A(c), we get all these things like economic damages, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, and punitive damages, all right? So I'll make every assumption you want.
The assumption is that all those things except for the word ""punitive damages"" were already part of what the defendants were facing. The only new one is punitive damages. So we're talking about a retroactive effect of the two words in this statute which -- called punitive damages, which didn't face the plaintiffs -- the defendant before.
All right? Fine. Now, if that's so, why isn't it still clear? Well, there's no reference to punitive -- you -- you -- you -- you summarized accurately 1083(c)(2).
There's no reference there to punitive damages.
There's no reference to the retroactivity -- No, all there is, is the word ""as if."" Right. And it says ""as if the action had originally been filed under 1605A(c),"" okay? So if it had been originally filed under 1605A(c), you would have -- when you're looking to the damage, what damages shall I give, said the judge? Well, read the words, economics, solatium, pain, suffering, and punitive damages. This Court's decisions, Landgraf and the progeny, they all say that there has to be a clear statement of retroactivity. Well, isn't this clear? That's not clear. It's clear because it says ""as if."" It's like if Socrates is a man, you know, what is that -- all men are mortal; if Socrates is a man, Socrates is mortal. It says all actions brought under 1605A, it shall be treated as if -- Right.
So -- so -- -- it is 1605, and to treat it under 1605A(c), you give punitive damages. Right.
So, again -- Maybe Socrates wasn't mortal, but I thought he was. (Laughter.) Well, 1083(c)(2) -- Yeah. -- applies only to pending cases, and it provides that by motion, a -- a party in a pending case, a plaintiff in a pending case -- Yeah. -- can make -- can, therefore, basically transition its action from the prior version, which is 15 -- 16 -- 1605(a)(7), to the new federal cause of action. So it's a transition.
It says nothing about punitive damages being -- being applied. It says nothing about retroactivity.
And this says -- Yeah.
It just says as if -- I mean, I don't want to repeat myself. So it's -- so it's putting -- so it's putting that transitioned plaintiff on the same footing as a fresh-filing -- Yep. -- 1605A person. Yep. That -- that says nothing about whether punitive damages should apply to pre-enactment conduct.
And -- There's something strange about the -- the whole discussion of retroactivity because the doctrine is supposed to be based on people having an opportunity to know what the law is and conform their conduct to it. Are you maintaining that Sudan might have withheld their aid to Al Qaeda just to prevent exposure to punitive damages? This Court's cases are pretty clear saying that even as to conduct that was illegal or immoral, the -- the bad man under -- to use Justice Holmes's terminology, is still entitled to notice of what the law is. Maybe a -- a -- a country in the position of a Sudan knowing about the extra liability of -- maybe they would have supervised their residents, their 40 million residents, a little more closely. But -- but the -- but the law does presume that -- particularly in the case of punitive damages, that it's only fair to apply them if the party was on notice of its exposure to that at the time of the relevant conduct.
Is there -- It's like a due process argument, and I guess if corporations are persons, maybe foreign countries are too.
I don't know the answer to that. That's another -- Well, this Court's said -- But that isn't in front of us, is it? And as far as the words ""pending cases"" are concerned, you fall within -- are you a pending case? Pardon me? Were you -- are your -- are these pending cases in your view? No, none of them are. They're not pending cases? Right.
None are. It says, ""with respect to any action that was brought under 1605(a)(7),"" yours was brought under -- No. It wasn't? What was it brought under? They were all brought after the enactment in 2008.
So they were all brought under 1605A.
Page 13 of our brief. Every one of these actions was filed after the enactment in 2008.
None were pending at the time of the enactment. This Section 1083(c) that we're all talking about is irrelevant to these cases. Oh, I see.
So your argument -- You're looking in the wrong place. Let me see I have if right.
Your argument is that 1605 -- this -- that this section is really about 1605(a)(7) -- Yes. -- and your cases are big A. Yes.
And there's nothing -- you can look throughout all the 2008 enactment, you will not see a whisper of a suggestion about the temporal application of claims under 1605A.
They don't exist.
That's why my friends are resorting to the pending action transition provisions, which are irrelevant to what we're talking about. But that -- wouldn't that be a little weird? In other words, you brought it under 1605A before what's called the Flatow Amendment, is this -- I don't know what you're -- No.
It's all after Flatow. All right, wait -- you're saying it's under big A, and this latter thing, application of pending cases, is only small a. Right. So if, in fact, you filed the -- a case in 1899 and it's still pending, it's true in some courts -- (Laughter.) -- the -- the -- and you -- you -- then you wouldn't -- you would have punitive damages applied to that? No.
I would -- But if you filed it -- No.
It still doesn't mention punitive damages.
It still doesn't talk about retroactivity. Landgraf sets a bar, and it's not just Landgraf; it's all the cases after it.
It's Lindh.
It's St. Cyr.
All of these cases say if you're going to imply -- to -- to apply punishment or significant increased damages retroactively, Congress, you got to say it pretty clearly.
You got to say, as to the new punitive damages, those apply retroactively to pre-enactment conduct.
It's not that hard to say.
Congress can say it. Nothing short of -- of referring explicitly to punitive damages would be sufficient? I -- I think that's right.
I think that's what ""explicit"" means and that's what ""express"" means in the Landgraf decision.
Words like ""express"" and ""explicit"" are all over Landgraf. Now, I do acknowledge that that -- in that footnote 8, where just Stevens was -- for the Court, was writing about the 1990 Civil Rights Act, which wasn't passed, he identified that as a better and maybe sufficient way to show retroactive effect, but there, there was a cross-reference specifically to the damages provision.
And it said that provision shall apply for cases on or before such and such a date. With -- with all due respect to Mr. -- my friend Mr. McGill, there's no close analogy between that provision in footnote 8 of Landgraf and what we're dealing with here.
Here we have literally nothing talking about the retroactive effect of 1605A.
Nothing. Mr. Curran, if I could understand your position, are you saying that punitive damages are the only thing that was new, or are you saying -- are you conceding that there are some states where other sorts of damages and maybe some other liability rules were new, but that those get kind of swept into the mix and there is retroactive application of those? I'm not aware of any new exposure that 1605A imposed, other than punitive damages. Suppose Mr. McGill can tell us we found three states where there's new exposure.
What happens to those? If there was no exposure in those states, and then now there is under the new federal cause of action, I think a foreign sovereign defendant has an argument that that is new, that is a new disability, that is a new punishment, and it shouldn't be applied retroactively without a clear statement by Congress.
I think that's under Landgraf. I want to be sure I understand this, but you're saying, I think, look at 1605A. Yes. When you look at 1605A, it does provide for punitive damages, but it doesn't say whether those punitive damages are retroactive. Correct. Now you look at 16- -- then you look at 1605A, application to pending cases.
And you're saying as to that, it has nothing to do with this case, because this was not a case that was brought under 1605(a)(7), which it has to do with? Is that right? I -- I'm not sure if I heard you right.
All -- all of these -- Is it -- All -- It says in -- -- all of these -- -- with respect to any action that was brought under section 1605(a)(7)? Yeah.
And that isn't yours? That -- that isn't ours. So that whole section doesn't apply -- No.
Right. -- and when we look at the section that does apply -- Right. -- we see that it doesn't say anything about retroactivity. I'll -- I'll say it again. Is that it? Is that it? Yes.
All four of these cases that we're dealing with in this case were filed after the enactment of the statute.
None of them were pending.
The only -- Is that a new argument? I thought -- are you saying that the federal cause of action does not apply retroactively at all? No, I'm -- Under the new federal cause of action all you can sue for are things that happened after the enactment of that provision? No, I'm saying that the new federal cause of action applies retroactively because under Landgraf's second step, it has no retro -- no practical retroactive operation. And if we disagree with that premise, you lose, right, because if -- if we think that a federal cause of action adds in any way a material new potential liability, different statutes of limitations, for example, different elements of the cause of action, whatever, if -- if we disagree with you and we think that a federal cause of action is separate and distinct from a state cause of action, you lose? No. Why not? How -- how do you prevail then? Because -- because if -- if the federal cause of action is really a new disability, is really a new -- Yeah. -- a new prejudice, then it requires an express statement by Congress -- And you've -- -- of retroactivity. And my understanding, though, is you've agreed that the retroactivity here is permissible, but you are saying that that -- that's -- that that -- maybe -- maybe I'm missing this.
Maybe the missing argument is that -- that your concession is no longer valid at that stage. No, no, no.
Oh, at that stage? Right.
If you change the premises of my concession, yes, my concession changes.
But -- but -- but my concession is premised on the very strong reality that the federal cause of action didn't add much to preexisting state causes of action. Excuse me.
Could I just clarify one step further? Please. Let's assume that this had been filed earlier than the amendment, that it was -- that it goes back to or it was timely filed before. Would you concede that 1605A(c) would make punitive damages retroactive as to that class of cases? I would not and I'll tell you why. All right.
That's where now I'm getting lost.
I followed you up to saying for new causes of action -- Okay.
If -- -- it's not clear. If 1083(c) was relevant because there was a pending case under 1605(a)7 -- Exactly. -- then I still would say where is the express or explicit command of retroactivity for punitive damages and I don't find that in 1083(c). You have a stronger argument.
I mean, you would say, look, if we had filed this three years later, the punitive damages part wouldn't apply because this retroactive -- the ""as if"" thing doesn't apply. And so it can't be clear.
It can't be clear to a preceding one when, although they refer to ""as if,"" it doesn't make sense to apply retroactivity to the older cases and not to the newer cases. And that itself creates an ambiguity. Right.
Saying ""as if"" isn't enough.
Saying -- Well, that's a pretty -- I mean, you have to say something like that. And, boy, we're in outer space, I think, by the -- we're -- Landgraf tells us the -- the -- the notion of retroactive imposition of -- Yeah. -- punitive damages is such a draconian step, it -- it is against -- See, I've got that. -- the basic principles going back centuries about fairness. So before we attribute that intention to Congress, we're going to ask Congress to say it pretty damn clearly. So, Mr. Curran -- That's all it says. -- in your state of the world and if I understand it, it's not just punitive action, punitive damages now, it's really any new liability, any new damages. So you're conceiving of a state of the world where a defendant foreign state gets to walk in and say, well, there's this new thing and that wouldn't have been true before, there's this new thing and that wouldn't have been true before, and -- and that's what it will all come down to, right? And -- and, boy, that seems -- that seems awfully complicated and probably not what Congress had in mind, that somebody would say under Pennsylvania law it works like this. Under Wisconsin law it works like this.
And then different people would be treated in different ways, depending on which state they were in. Could that make any sense? Well, the -- first of all, these principles aren't just for foreign sovereigns.
Right? These are for -- this is for litigation writ large. Yeah. Right? And -- and we're not taking a position that, oh, oh, the federal cause of action shouldn't apply retroactivity because of people in Pennsylvania.
Look, we're not -- we're taking a more practical approach to this, that, in general, the -- the federal cause of action adds nothing new.
So it has no retroactive operation under Landgraf, therefore, it applies retroactively. This is what Landgraf says.
So I -- we're not asking for any change of the law. We're asking for equal-handed treatment of Sudan, as -- on the same footing that other litigants would enjoy the presumptions and other -- other statements in Landgraf, but we're not asking for anything new or radical here. This case presents a straightforward application of the Landgraf steps.
Is there -- is there a clear statement by Congress? If not, then we look and see whether there's a retroactive operation.
If there is a retroactive operation, such as with punitive damages, then the presumption kicks in and -- and the -- and the -- and the new provision cannot apply retroactively.
That's it.
We're not asking for anything radical here. There are other arguments we make in -- in our briefs, including on subject matter jurisdiction.
We invite the Court to consider those, including the one -- that that argues that the Helmerich decision of a couple of years ago has not been applied correctly here because the Court here found that -- applied a wrong standard for jurisdictional causation. We also take issue with the idea that -- that this case involves an extrajudicial killing, because that's a specific term of art under international law.
And we raise a series of other jurisdictional arguments that probably would require a remand or further briefing. Are they -- I know one is a limitation, statute of limitation question, which is an affirmative defense, not a jurisdictional issue. Well, that -- that's the issue, Justice Ginsburg.
The issue is whether the limitations defense is jurisdictional and, therefore, cannot be waived by a defaulting foreign sovereign or whether it is an affirmative defense that can be waived. And our position is, given the placement and text of 1605A(b), that it should be interpreted to be jurisdictional so the court of appeals should have addressed it on the merits. Mr. -- Mr. McGill says that if your interpretation of extrajudicial killing is correct, then the terrorism exception doesn't apply to terrorism. Yeah, that -- that's -- that's semantics. Well -- well -- If there's no question that the four predicate acts each constitute types of terrorism, okay, so -- so it's still the terrorism exception. My question for -- my question to Mr. McGill, I guess, is how come Congress rejected the -- the act of terrorism as it was proposed in the early versions of the -- of the terrorism exception? Well, which terrorists would be covered under your -- under your understanding? Only those who are -- are officially on the payroll of the state? No, no, agents and others engaging in the acts.
Well, it depends -- it may depend on the predicate act, right, there are four predicate acts.
Two of them, extrajudicial killing and torture, are acts under international law that can only be committed by state actors. The other ones, aircraft sabotage and hostage taking, under those conventions, anyone, you don't have to be a state actor, but you can be guilty of the violation under international law.
So it depends on -- on the predicate act. And -- and the ATA, right, we've got the antiterrorist act, which does criminalize and provide civil remedies for acts of international terrorism, that excepts foreign states. So when one considers the broad terrorism statutory scheme, one sees that acts of terrorism generally are prohibited and criminalized and provide for civil remedies, but not against a foreign state, but under the four predicate acts that are embedded in the terrorism exception, those are acts that Congress carefully considered with the advice of the State Department and concluded that those acts are all condemned universally by international law. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
Three minutes, Mr. McGill. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Breyer, let's start with what this case is.
If you turn to 28(a) of the government's brief, you will see the provision for related actions.
That's what these cases are. A related action is -- is one which is -- where there is a -- a case that has been timely commenced under the old terrorism exception, 1605(a)(7), and that's the Owens case, filed in 2001, then any other action -- turn the page -- arising out of the same act or incident may be brought under 1605A.
That is us. We -- because we are related to Owens, we arise out of the same act or incident as Owens, we file under 1605A.
What happens then? Under 1605A1 -- I'm -- I'm sorry, under 1083(c)1, the amendments made by this section shall apply to any claim arising under Section 1605A. The amendments of 1083, therefore, apply to our claims.
And at page 43, Sudan concedes that -- and I'm reading now -- ""Section 1083(C)(1) simply provides that all the amendments under Section 1083 apply to a claim arising under Section 1605A."" All the amendments.
That includes punitive damages. But he's saying -- I think he's saying, look at the -- look at the first -- look at 2(b)(a) in the application to pending cases.
And he's saying with respect to any action brought under 1605(a)(7) -- small a -- that's where this retroactivity, that's where the thing applies, and he says his was -- yours isn't. We're not -- we're -- But you come to -- We're not -- -- the related part. -- a prior action.
We're a related action. Arising out -- But 1605A - -- of the same -- -- applies to both. Prior actions is the Acree case.
Prior actions are cases that already had punitive damages judgments that Congress said could be revived. Any judgment in the action ""shall be given effect as if it had been filed under 1605A(c)."" And it was for that reason that the President first vetoed it, and it was in response to the President's veto that Congress gives waiver authority with respect to Iraq. Mr. McGill, the one argument that they make that I -- can we avoid reaching, is a subject matter jurisdiction, whether relatives of victims for their independent state tort actions fall within any of these statutes, because they all require a U.S. nexus. Yes.
So the -- the argument is that claimant in 1085 -- 1605A(a) means legal representative.
That's their argument.
That argument is wrong for several reasons: First, it's contrary to the plain meaning of claimant.
Second, claimant or victim was language added in a technical amendment in 1997, and it was consistent -- may I -- You can get to third, and then -- Consistently -- consistently applied by lower courts for some 12 years.
And Congress legislated against that background, ratified that, and I'd cite the Inclusive Communities Project for that. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case Number 19-267, Our Lady of Guadalupe School versus Agnes Morrissey-Berru, and the consolidated case. Mr. Rassbach. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If separation of church and state means anything at all, it must mean the government cannot interfere with the church's decisions about who is authorized to teach its religion. In this country, it is emphatically not the province of judges, juries, or government officials to decide who ought to teach Catholic fifth graders that Jesus is the son of God or who ought to teach Jewish preschoolers what it means to say: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one. And at bottom, that is what these cases are about: who controls who teaches the faith to schoolchildren. Under Hosanna-Tabor, the answer is easy.
Churches must choose those who ""teach their faith."" Indeed, that is one of the most important religious functions for any religious community, passing the faith on to the next generation. And since the teachers here were the churches' primary agents for teaching the Catholic faith to fifth graders, teaching them for hours a week, much more than parish priests, they fall within the ministerial exception immunity. Respondents would have the Court ignore all that, substituting a formalistic standard that relies first and foremost on the employees' title to determine whether the ministerial exception applies.
That would wrongly elevate form over function and force judges to decide what titles sound religious enough to qualify, and it would hopelessly entangle church and state.
Unsurprisingly, no court has ever adopted Respondents' title test. If Respondent's arguments give some members of the Court déjà vu all over again, that is because Respondents have recycled many of the arguments the Court unanimously rejected eight years ago in Hosanna-Tabor.
The pretext inquiry, the notice requirement, the idea that freedom of association makes freedom of religion entirely unnecessary all were raised in Hosanna-Tabor and rejected unanimously.
Eight years later, Respondents' arguments are not any more convincing. In short, there's no reason for government to get in the business of teaching religion.
The Ninth Circuit should be reversed. Counsel, you say in your brief that personnel is policy and that teachers, as part of their job, personify church values.
Is that enough to trigger the exception in your case? I -- I think, in -- in this case, I don't think that's something you have to address, and I don't think that it would -- personification -- Well, I don't -- I don't have to address it, but you do because I asked. (Laughter.) Yes, Your Honor.
I -- I think, on -- on the basis of personification alone, I don't -- I don't think that that would necessarily mean -- mean that we would win the case. I think that the -- the right answer is that it's something -- they -- what functions were they performing, and those functions were to teach the faith for hours on end over the course of a week. Does your argument, both with respect to personifying values as a factor and with the other functions that the teachers might perform, apply in the case of teachers who are not Catholic because many Catholic schools hire teachers who -- who aren't? So -- so I -- I don't think it -- it does.
Hosanna-Tabor rejected the idea that there was a problem with non-Lutherans teaching Lutheran doctrine to Lutheran kids at a Lutheran school.
And, ultimately, religious bodies get to decide who best performs those important religious functions, and courts really shouldn't be in the business of second-guessing that. I would point the Court to some of the briefs, for example, the Stephen Wise Temple brief, which talks about how difficult it would be for Jewish entities if they could not hire non-coreligionists. Justice Thomas? Yes, counsel, how would you -- how exactly would you go about, or a secular court go about, determining whether an employee's duties and functions are religious or whether they're important? Well, I -- I think -- I think the -- the best way to think about it is, with respect to the religious part of it, I think you -- you have to -- you can look at the -- the list of things that this Court talked about in Hosanna-Tabor, so teaching, preaching, as well as the -- the list that was in the concurrence by Justice Alito, and look at those as a kind of safe harbor in terms of, if one of those things is present, then -- then it clearly is an important religious function. But then, if you -- if you -- let's say you have something where the church is -- or the religious defendant is raising some other thing as an important religious function, then I think you probably -- you -- you would -- you would have to look -- do some deference to the church's understanding of that. So -- and -- and this is pointed out actually in the brief by Professor McConnell where he talks about substantial deference on both the importance question and the religious question. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? I would appreciate your answers to two questions.
One is, who among the religious schools' employees, who among them are not ministers? The second question is one that the Chief already alluded to.
You do not have to be Catholic to be a fifth or sixth grade teacher. How can a Jewish teacher be required to model Catholic faith, counter to his or her own beliefs -- how can a Jewish teacher be a Catholic minister? So, to answer both of your questions, Your Honor, with respect to who is not covered, I -- I think it would include anyone who's not performing important religious functions, so, for example, the janitor.
And there you have the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation case that we cite in our briefing, where the janitor, although he did explain what a Sukkah was to the schoolchildren, still did not -- did not want that to -- he -- that did not qualify him -- him as a minister.
And that was cited under Hosanna-Tabor. I think the same thing would be true of someone who, for example, is just doing the IT for the company or the school. As for -- Yes, whether coaches, the athletic coaches, they would be ministers too? I don't -- I don't think a coach -- did you say coach, Your Honor? Uh-huh. Yes, I don't think a coach would necessarily be one.
It would really depend on whether the -- the person -- the particular person is performing important religious function.
If they're just a coach and don't do any kinds of functions, then they would not come in under the exception. Suppose they lead the -- the team in an opening prayer. I think that if they do an opening prayer, you know, forget what I -- you know, I think that there would be -- just saying that, just doing that would probably come within something like the Sukkah situation with the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation case where it's essentially de minimis.
It's not something that -- that by itself does that. I think, in reality, that's not going to be a very big class of cases because usually, if they're doing -- leading a prayer before the game, they're also doing a host of other kinds of activities -- Justice Breyer? -- in that event. I think that the statute itself provides for a religious exemption for hiring the person of a particular religion where that's connected with the carrying on of the religious organization's activities. There is also the BFOQ, the Bona Fide Occupational Qualification.
So I thought this case has to do where a religious organization might dismiss someone on the basis of race or religion or national origin where that isn't related to religious -- where that isn't related to the carrying on of the religious activity, for example, a person who's handicapped. Now why should the minister -- isn't it enough to have the ministerial exemption apply to that kind of thing, that is, whether a person holds a position of religious leadership or authority? Well, there's different -- different kinds of evidence that would show that. So why do you need more than that? Well, I think it's -- I think it's because of the Establishment Clause, Your Honor.
The -- you know, this is not just a sort of bilateral interaction between the employer on one side and the employee on the other.
There's also a third ox that's getting gored here, which is the -- society's interest in not controlling religious functions. You know, we have a -- a system of separation of church and state.
And the process of teaching schoolchildren what to believe -- On the basis -- I don't want to interrupt, but on the basis of what you say so far, I take it to my question, which is what do the religious organizations need other than the exception in the statute, the BFOQ, and the ministerial exemption as confined to leadership, and your answer seems to be they don't. No, no, they -- Rather, there's a -- -- they absolutely -- they absolutely do, Justice Breyer.
And -- How? -- and -- and -- because -- because, to have control over what they are doing and to be able to control the performance of this important religious function, conveying the faith to younger kids, that -- that is a -- that is a free exercise right that they absolutely have and should have. And I don't think that the BFOQ exception or Title VII or any of the other -- Religious exemptions -- -- statutes can overrule that. Justice Alito? Oh, let me follow up on that question.
The -- the religious exemption, if it applied here, would permit the school to hire only a Catholic to teach the -- this -- in this capacity, right? It would not -- it would not address the question whether the school could dismiss somebody who is a Catholic because that person is not teaching the faith in the way in which the school wants. Is that -- is that a correct understanding? I -- I -- I think that -- I think that you're right, Justice Alito, in -- in this sense.
Hiring and firing are clearly covered by the ministerial exception, but there are other kinds of religious autonomy doctrines that might come to bear. If, for example, you know, the example we used in our briefing of the employee of the synagogue school who starts wearing anti-Semitic T-shirts to school, that is -- that has to be covered by other kinds of religious autonomy and First Amendment doctrines, not just the ministerial exception. So, even if the janitor did that, it would fall other one of those other kinds of doctrines, not under the ministerial exception itself. Well, I took Justice Breyer's question to mean why isn't the exemption in Title VII that allows religion to be a qualification for certain jobs sufficient to address the question of a teacher who teaches religion in a religiously affiliated school? Right.
So it is true, Your Honor, that the -- the -- if you -- if the person is -- is teaching -- is not -- if the -- if the bona fide -- if the -- if the BFOQ exception applies here, it -- it -- it wouldn't actually cover most of the kinds of people that carry out the important religious functions.
So there's a disjunct between the two things. Thank you. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, there's a difference between a teacher who teaches a religion class in a secular school and a teacher who teaches religion in a religious school, but I'm not sure what the difference is, meaning, can you point me to anything in the evidence that the teacher here was acting any differently working from a workbook for her religious class than a teacher does in a secular school? That's my first question. My second question is, I think what's being confused here is that you're asking for an exception to law that's broader than the ministerial exception generally and broader than is necessary to protect the church. The two teachers at issue here are not claiming that they were fired because the school thought they were teaching religion wrong.
One says she was fired because she came down with cancer and was fired for a medical condition. The other claims it was because of age.
She had been there for many, many years and had been very acceptable to the school, and all of a sudden, she reaches a certain age and she's fired. So you're asking for an exception to the Family and Medical Leave Act, to wage and hourly laws, to all sorts of laws, including breach of contract because at least one of the schools here, contract with the teacher says they won't discriminate because of the teacher's age or disability. So you're asking for something broader than giving the -- the schools the power to hire or fire certain kinds of people because of how they teach the religion or don't teach it, and you haven't explained to me why it's necessary. So -- I don't understand what leadership role or proselytizing role these teachers played in simply teaching about religion. So -- so, Your Honor, they -- they absolutely were doing much more than teaching about religion.
They were teaching it devotionally, and they were -- they were proselytizing.
Their job, number one, and their overriding commitment was to -- to teach these kids to become Catholic and to believe in the Catholic faith. So I don't think that -- I just -- I'm not sure I agree with the premise of the question.
With respect to, you know, religious reasons, first -- first of all, you know, the -- Hosanna-Tabor rejected that -- that exact same argument and said it missed the point of the ministerial exception, and the reason it missed it was because it's inherently -- it's inherently entangling to transfer authority and control over a position that teaches the faith devotionally from church to state. So the suggestion -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Mr. Rassbach, I have a too-long list of hypotheticals, so I'm hoping that you can answer them in just a few words, like basically, yes, he qualifies, no, he doesn't qualify. So here's the first one.
A math teacher who is told to teach something about Judaism for 10 minutes a week. And if he's teaching it devotionally? Let's just say this is all -- that's all you know about him. That's all I know about him.
Then I -- then -- then I would -- then I would say probably not -- Okay. -- because it would be de minimis. A math teacher who comes in and you -- you mentioned the Shema at the beginning of your remarks, a very important prayer, takes about 20 seconds to say, a math teacher who was told to begin every class with a -- leading the Shema. I -- I -- I don't -- I don't think that that is likely to fall within it because I think it would, again, be de minimis under the -- Okay.
A math teacher who was told to embody Jewish values and infuse instruction with Jewish values. If it's that alone, probably not.
But it really depends on how that -- Okay. -- cashes out in actual practice. Yeah, okay.
I really am asking -- asking these things alone. Okay. A nurse at a Catholic hospital who prays with sick patients and is told otherwise to tend to their religious needs. I -- I think a nurse doing that kind of counseling and prayer may well fall within the exception. May well fall within it? Okay. Yes. A press or a communications staffer who prepares press releases for a religious institution of all kinds that they need? That -- that should fall within it because of communication under the Alicea-Hernandez case from the Seventh Circuit. Okay.
A counselor at a church-affiliated rehab clinic who urges his patients to reconnect with their faith community? That -- that would be a -- probably, but it depends on how much connecting there is. Okay.
An employee at a soup kitchen who distributes religious literature and leads grace before meals? My guess is that that would be de minimis under the same kind of rubric as the Davis case that I mentioned earlier. Okay.
A church organist who provides musical accompaniment and selects hymns for services? I think that that usually would fall within it because that's an important religious function and that's the main job. Okay.
A cook who's actually not Jewish but who prepares kosher-compliant meals for children at a Jewish school? No. No, okay.
What's the -- you -- you got through them all.
Thank you. What's the connection? What -- what are we supposed to draw from this? Well, I -- again, I think it's -- I think we laid it out in our -- in our briefing, and that is, what is -- what is it that this person is doing, performing on behalf of the religious body? So what is the -- what is the function that they're performing on behalf of that body? It's not all religious exercise.
It's a subset of the different kinds of religious exercise that are out there. It is -- and it is the kinds of things that were listed in the Alito concurrence.
It was listed as the sort of verbs that we teased out in the main opinion in Hosanna-Tabor, which is preaching, teaching, guiding, communicating, things like that that -- that are -- that are crucial to what you do as a religious organization.
So I -- I think -- Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I'd like to follow up on -- on Justice Kagan's line of questioning.
In response to a number of them, you indicated that you thought that the religious activities were de minimis and therefore wouldn't qualify. You're asking a secular court to make that judgment.
And even when some deference is given to a religious organization in a qualified immunity sort of way or otherwise, you're still asking us to make a judgment between who qualifies as a minister and who does not on the basis of our judgment that their activity with respect to a religion is de minimis. And I -- I'm just wondering, does that pose some problems for you and for your clients in some of these cases? I -- I can easily see a school in which everybody takes a pledge that everything they're going to do is to help teach these kids to be part of the faith, and -- and churches believe, unlike some, that -- that every -- every member is a minister and not just a -- not just limited to clergy. So what do we do about that? The next case is going to be a school in which a janitor takes a pledge, or the school bus driver or the coach, and they all believe sincerely that they are ministers, and you're going to have us tell them, no, your active duties are too de minimis? Well, I mean, I think this is part of -- part of the issue with -- with the use of the word ""minister."" This is a kind of immunity that really goes to the kind -- kinds of things that are done, that are the kinds of things you would never contemplate having a governmental entity do. And so, therefore, you know, it's true that they may well be within their faith tradition a minister, but the term ""minister,"" as was, you know, explained in -- in the colloquy -- one of the colloquies that Justice Scalia had in Hosanna-Tabor, is that it -- that it's -- it's a legal term here.
It's a -- and it was -- it arose in the 1985 Rayburn case. So I think that there's a -- there's a real -- there's -- you have to see it as a subset of the kinds of things that are done on behalf of the religious community that make it distinctive.
So it's not going to cover the gas station attendant or the -- the bus driver.
It has to -- it has to go to those functions that make religious -- religious communities distinctive within our society. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Rassbach.
Do you think the exception applies to teachers who teach religious doctrine or teachers perhaps more broadly who teach religious values? How would you answer that question? Which of the two are you looking at? Yes, so I -- I think if -- if they're -- if -- if a -- if a teacher is teaching religion devotionally, doctrine, values, what -- what have you, or just religious practices, then that teacher's going to come within the exception. And one way to think about it is this is an Establishment Clause-rooted doctrine.
So there's a -- there's a sort of heuristic here where, if it's something that you would start to feel nervous about having in a public school, done by public school teachers, then how can you turn around and reach into the religious -- private religious school and have the government tell them how to arrange those affairs? So I think that -- Well, I think a number of the questions so far have gone to the limits -- as it often happens, the limits if you were to win this case, and so we're thinking about where it would go. And so say the English teacher who sprinkles in references to Matthew 25 and feed the hungry or the art teacher who talks -- talks about art in the Vatican or the football coach who says the Memorare before every practice and game, the basketball coach who says Our Lady of Victory, pray for us, those kinds of things are definitely instilling religious values. Are those people therefore covered or not covered? I -- I -- I think that -- that in -- in most cases, it's the -- they -- they probably would -- if it's only that, if it's just doing the one thing, the sort of saying grace before meal situation, that -- that could be -- that that probably would fall outside the exception because it's not the -- it's not at the -- the heart of what they're doing.
But I don't think that there's actually a whole lot of situations where that is -- is actually the only thing that such coaches or teachers or other -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure about that factually, and I guess the question that Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch asked is, are we going to have litigation over what particular students take out of particular coaches or particular teachers? I'm not sure how we do that if you were to win this case and then we go on to the next case. I -- I think that the -- I think that your limiting principle is looking at, you know, what was laid out in Hosanna-Tabor.
It's not just -- you know, the important religious functions are not just any religious exercise, but they're sort of a subset of religious functions that the person's performing as the agent of the religious community and that that's, you know, the main part of their job. So it can't be something where it's -- it's just, you know, something that you -- you know, you have the -- the physics teacher that has a crucifix on the wall.
That's one thing. If you have the physics teacher who adds a sermonette to every single class, that's a different one.
And that is -- Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ratner? Ms. Ratner? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three proposed approaches to the ministerial exception on the table.
First, in most lower courts, an employee's function has been central to the analysis. Second, in the Ninth Circuit, an employer must check off one or more formalities even if an employee's religious function is clear. And, third, in Respondents' view, this Court should go even further and make formality the key, with function serving just as a cross-check. The first approach is the right one. The touchstone of the ministerial exception should be whether an employee performs important religious functions.
That's because function reflects the First Amendment interest at stake and because, critically, it's more neutral among different religions. Here, we're talking about teachers of religious doctrine at a religious school.
Under Hosanna-Tabor, those teachers are ministering to their students by teaching them how and why to be Catholic.
So they should fall within the ministerial exception regardless of what the school calls them. Counsel, Hosanna-Tabor looked at all of the factors in the case, and the issue now seems to be what emphasis you should put on one of those factors, religious function, and what emphasis on a different one, the ministerial title. I guess, in addressing that question, I'd like to repeat Justice Gorsuch's question to you as a representative of the government.
How is -- is a court supposed to determine what is a significant religious function and what is an insignificant one? Well, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to the first part of your question, we do think the Court left open in Hosanna-Tabor what is the appropriate methodology here.
It said that expressly and repeatedly. And we think the reason why the function is the best approach is, as I mentioned, it -- it advances the purposes identified in Hosanna-Tabor.
The -- the way that one would determine whether this is an important religious function is first by looking to the categories set out in Hosanna-Tabor and particularly if the Court were to pick up the additional elaboration in Justice Alito's concurrence.
Then we're talking about things like preaching, teaching, worship, leadership, and rituals. You have a pretty defined set that we think would cover the mine run of cases in this area.
So it's not going to be an exceptionally indeterminate analysis.
Just to underscore that, this is a concept that has been around in the lower courts since the 1980s.
And so, again, it's not something that we're invented -- inventing here or that these courts are going to significantly struggle with. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes.
Counsel, my question is similar to that.
I am perplexed as to what you do, for example, with the chemistry teacher who starts class with the Hail Mary or the theology teacher -- or the chemistry teacher who's a nun who starts class with -- chemistry class with the Hail Mary, or the lay teacher who teaches religion but does it in a very straightforward, objective way. How would you handle those? I -- I don't see how -- what standards a secular court would use to determine which of those is a function, an important duty or function, religious duty or function. Sure, Justice Thomas.
So we think that the important religious functions are those of the type that I mentioned before, and then the question in some of these cases that have been hypothesized is just, is that really a meaningful part of a person's job or, as Petitioner's counsel called it, is that just a de minimis part of a person's job? If that job is in one of your hypotheticals teaching religion, then, of course, the answer is yes.
If that job is teaching something secularly and we're talking about one prayer, then the -- the answer may not be yes. But, if -- if I could give the Court some comfort on this, there really has been three main buckets of recurring claims since Hosanna-Tabor, and that's been principals and teachers of religious schools, worship musicians, and leaders of religious congregations.
Those are the ministerial exception claims that we see again and again. And we think all of those would be resolved or at least this Court would set a clear path forward if it were to adopt a function-focused approach. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? The breadth of the exemption is staggering; that is, these people are exempt from all anti-discrimination laws. So, to take a stark example, suppose a teacher who does everything the two teachers in -- in these cases do, as a faith leader, also reports a student's complaint of sexual harassment by a priest and is terminated.
She has no remedy? Justice Ginsburg, I think that question goes to the ""what is covered by the ministerial exception"" as opposed to the ""who falls within it."" And on the ""what is covered,"" we're simply asking for the same thing that this Court decided in Hosanna-Tabor. And the Court there specifically didn't decide whether things like retaliation for sexual abuse reporting would be covered. What it did decide was that employment discrimination claims that involve the hiring or firing of an employee necessarily go to a religious organization's ability to control who ministers to the faithful and that those claims are categorically precluded. So we would apply the same rule here. And then the question is just what's the appropriate methodology for determining that a person is one who ministers to the faithful. Then her having cancer has nothing to do with the performance of her religious functions.
She needs time off and the government says she should have time off to take care of her disease. Yes, Justice -- Yes? So, yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is the assertion, but, again, this Court said in Hosanna-Tabor that requiring a particular religious reason misses the point of the exemption and that it really is categorical once we're in the category of employment discrimination claims relating to hiring and firing. So, if it's categorical, why then doesn't it take care of the teacher who reports a student's claim of abuse by a priest? So, again, I think that there may well be arguments that that type of retaliation claim would also have to be covered. My point is merely that the Court avoided deciding that in Hosanna-Tabor, and we think that it could continue to do so here. And it would be the same if what was reported that the principal of the school, Sister Mary Margaret, had been stealing from the school, from the school's till regularly, to pay for her gambling excursions to Las Vegas.
The teacher reports that, and she's terminated. So, Justice Ginsburg, again, all of this relates to what is the potential scope, what are the types of claims, and, in particular, retaliation claims, for which the -- to which the ministerial exception would apply. I think there are logical reasons why maybe some of those claims could come in, but we think the better approach -- excuse me, why maybe some of those claims would be covered by the ministerial exception, but we think the better approach is to continue to do what this Court did in Hosanna-Tabor and say we don't need to decide those sort of outlier cases right now, we're deciding things that relate to the employee/employer relationship and a hiring/firing claim under the employment -- Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer? Counsel, I'd -- I'd like to ask you about the -- your categorical line thought.
As I understand it, this is -- the kinds of claims that are brought are not about religion. There is a BFOQ and there is the religious exemption and taken together, where the organization does something related to religion, and that's why they dismissed the person, they're likely to win if the case is brought in the first place. We're talking about the kinds of things anyway that Justice Ginsburg raised. That's the kind of thing.
Should there be an immunity there? And I think the Court has previously decided yes, there should be when the person is a minister because, in that situation, don't even get into it, Court, don't even get into it. So who falls within the minister? Now I can say easily a person of leadership or authority.
That's not going to help that much. So, when you take your categorical approach, minister, person of leadership, person of authority, what do you want to add? How do we explain to people in your view what that should amount to? Well, Your Honor, I think, at a minimum, you need to add the other categories that you discussed in Hosanna-Tabor. And it -- you specifically said this doesn't just apply to leaders of the congregation, it applies to other employees who preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. So we think that, at -- at a minimum, those teaching the faith during the week to schoolchildren and not just those preaching the faith on the weekend to adults are included within that category. And then, when we're talking about what it means to carry out the religion's mission, then we -- we think that there are other categories, some helpfully laid out by Justice Alito's concurrence, like worship, leadership, and rituals that would also come in. Why? Why if it's a plain teacher and teaches religion too, why is it necessary to keep out of it entirely, even if that teacher or whoever administrator is does discriminate on the basis of handicap? Because, once you've made the decision that somebody is performing an important religious function, then this Court said in Hosanna-Tabor that getting into why they were dismissed misses the point because, at that point, the religious organization has to be capable of deciding who is going to minister to the faithful, who is going to fulfill that role of teaching Catholic schoolchildren that Jesus is the son of God and God created the world and this is the appropriate way to be Catholic. Thank you. And -- Justice Alito? What do you think is the relevance of titles in this inquiry? So, Justice Alito, we think that, of course, all the considerations that this Court mentioned in Hosanna-Tabor, including title, may be relevant.
But the best way to think about them is that they may be relevant in illustrating whether someone performs an important religious function. And I think, to do the opposite, to require a title as sort of a separate check box that needs to be ticked off, is going to create a real problem in terms of neutrality among religions. Some faiths have those sorts of formalities.
Some faiths don't.
I think a particularly salient example is that the Lutheran Church in Hosanna-Tabor had available to it things like called teachers and commissioned ministers, and those types of non-ordained ministerial-sounding titles just aren't used by a lot of faiths, in particular, Catholicism, Judaism, and others. And so that's why we think the title -- and to the title, the existence of it, can be used to help understand someone's religious role but not as a freestanding inquiry. Well, how does it even help to understand the person's role? Suppose you have two people who do exactly the same thing in two different religiously affiliated schools, but one has a title and the other one doesn't have a title other than the title of teacher. Why should the presence or absence of this title make any difference? So it shouldn't in the circumstance where we know clearly what individuals are doing.
If it's a little harder to understand based on the facts whether someone does, in fact, play an important religious function and if the religion that we know gives out titles for different types of religious functions, then perhaps it could shed some light on the question.
But -- but, no, in a circumstance like we have here where a teacher performs the exact same function that Ms. Perich did in Hosanna-Tabor, then we don't think the absence of a title should make any difference. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, in your brief, you're encouraging us not just to define who's a minister by important religious function, but you're asking us to defer to the religious organization's determination of what's an important religious function. That's a recipe for saying the teacher who says a prayer at the beginning of a class, every teacher, whether it's a math teacher, a computer teacher, a gym teacher, they're doing an important religious function because all the -- all the school has to say is that's important to us, number one. Number two, I thought what Hosanna, our prior case, was recognizing is that when you're talking about a leader, a -- a person who stewards a religion, that they are entitled to this absolution.
You are now -- absolution from liability and law. You are now suggesting that we as judges have an obligation to expand the exemption that we've created in law.
I thought that was always Congress who would do that, not us, and as Justice Breyer indicated, they've already done it.
You're asking us to -- to broaden that to anyone who does -- whose job is not primarily religious in any way. And for decades, the lower courts, most of them, have not used any of the tests all of you are proposing.
They've used the primarily religious -- not -- not important but primarily religious functions. And I don't think that lay teachers who are hired as lay teachers, not as religious teachers, it's hard to see how they qualify as primarily religious leaders. So, Justice Sotomayor, on your first question, I want to be very clear. When we're talking about deferring to religious organizations, we think that this Court has already outlined sort of objectively what would be considered this class of important religious functions, and the deference we're talking about are in those rare cases where there's some dispute about whether someone actually performs those.
There's a case where there was a question whether an organist is important to worship, whether a Hebrew teacher at a Jewish school is important to teaching the Jewish faith, things of that nature. On your second question, we agree that the ministerial exception applies to those who lead and steward the religion and perform other functions involving stewardship and personification of the faith.
And that's exactly what teachers do.
It's -- the question is really just of methodology.
Is this based on what you do or on what you are called? And it more -- Justice Kagan? Ms. Ratner, I was struck by the emphasis that your brief gave to the idea that it was not important whether an individual was a member of a particular faith. As I understood it, that the central premise of the ministerial exception is that there are certain individuals within faith communities who have a particularly distinctive special role about how to propagate the faith. And if a position can be filled by any old person, not by a member of a faith, isn't that a pretty good sign that the employee doesn't have that special role within the religious community? No, Justice Kagan, I don't think so, and -- and there are really several reasons.
The -- the most important one is that's essentially a religious judgment about who is qualified to perform certain important religious functions and how much of the creed of that religion you need to share to perform that function. The second is that this is a really entangling inquiry to engage in in practice. And the third is that the result is going to have a disproportionate effect on minority religions. And I don't -- I want to be clear here that these are not just abstract questions.
One of the schools in this case, for example, said that it preferred Catholic teachers, but it would make exceptions for certain other Protestant religions, like Lutherans.
I don't know how to -- whether to consider that, you know, a partial coreligionist requirement. I don't know whether that's different from a Reformed Jewish school that would hire an Orthodox Jewish teacher.
And I don't think that that's a road that the Court wants to go down on -- to go down, particularly if it has concerns about other potentially entangling parts of this analysis. In -- in some of your answers, you've talked a lot about the language in Hosanna-Tabor, which is, you know, leading, preaching, teaching, and -- but, of course, Hosanna-Tabor connected that up with the title, with the training, with the formal commissioning. And when you take all of those things away and you're just left with those terms, ""preaching"" and ""teaching,"" that's when you get into all the tricky questions like, how much preaching? How much teaching? Of what kind? Any -- any prayer that you say during the day? Any amount of teaching? And -- and so how would we deal with that? Again, I think the way to deal with that is by understanding there to be a baseline here that the religious functions of the type discussed in Hosanna-Tabor have to be a meaningful part of somebody's job duties.
And so a lot of these kind of outlier hypotheticals that are suggested are not the circumstances where this even has arisen.
The -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, elsewhere in the First Amendment and under RFRA, we have emphasized repeatedly that we do not inquire into how important the -- the plaintiff's religious belief is or how central it is to their faith.
We protect any sincerely held religious belief precisely because we're afraid about entangling courts in making religious judgments and discriminating against minority religions that may have views about what's important that are unusual or different from our own. Here, however, it seems to me, instead of pursuing that line of argument and suggesting that the sincerely held religious belief about who is a minister should control, you're asking this Court to involve itself in deciding for itself who is and who is not an important minister or just a de minimis, I think is the words you've -- you've used, person in -- in the teaching of religion. Doesn't that create just exactly the sort of entanglement problems that we've tried to avoid elsewhere and discriminate potentially against minority religions that may have different views of ministers than -- than you or I may have? And you -- you -- you reject all these hypotheticals as speculative or haven't yet arisen, but the very test you propose would seem to me to invite them. So, Justice Gorsuch, a couple points.
I think the first, the reason we have not advocated for a completely deferential approach is the reason Petitioners' counsel alluded to, and that's that the ministerial exception is really a legal term of art.
And so different religions may have different views on who constitutes a minister under that particular faith, but that's not necessarily going to map on to the sphere that this Court has said has to be left to religious organizations. So we don't think that there's any way to entirely extricate yourself from this problem.
And so then the question just becomes, what is the methodology? And if the worry is discriminating among religions and disadvantaging minority religions, then that's a significantly greater worry if we're talking about things like title and training than if we're using generalized functional -- a generalized functional approach that looks to the types of things that religions usually operate with across the -- Oh, well -- -- board. -- there -- there exactly is the problem, ""usually."" ""Usually."" And that -- that discriminates in favor of majority conceptions about religious doctrine and teaching. Why couldn't we just simply say that a sincerely held religious belief about who is a minister should control, just like we do everywhere else in the First Amendment and in Again, Your Honor, everywhere else we're talking about sincerely held beliefs for purposes of, say, a free exercise claim or a RFRA claim.
Here, we're talking about a -- a constitutional protection that this Court has said is limited to those who are ministering to the faithful or who personify the church, and we don't think that's necessarily going to map on to the particular definition of a minister that one organization may use. And, of course -- Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good afternoon, Ms. Ratner.
Just want to confirm that your view that the roots of this exception are the Constitution and not statute. Professor Laycock refers to principle of religious autonomy rooted in the Free Exercise and Establishment Clause. Is that correct? I think that's correct. I don't see how you could read the Court's decision in Hosanna-Tabor to adopt some sort of statutory constitutional avoidance analysis in the same vein as Catholic Bishop.
I think it's pretty clearly a -- a First Amendment holding in that case.
So that's what -- Okay. -- we're -- You used the phrase ""teaching the faith."" And, of course, looking ahead, if you -- your side were to prevail in this case, to -- to future cases, what does ""teaching the faith"" mean, a similar question that I asked your colleague about instilling religious values, not just teaching specific doctrine. You know, a school could have a creed of instilling the value of being a person for others in all its students, and all the teachers and coaches are told to underscore that message in how they go about instructing or coaching the students.
That's the religious value, and they're all told to -- to pursue that in different ways. How do we analyze a case like that? So I think that those cases are obviously going to be more difficult. It's a heartland case when you're talking about the formal teaching of religious doctrine on a daily or near daily basis, as we have here and as the Court had in Hosanna-Tabor. If we're talking about something that looks more like modeling the faith, I think you're going to have to do a more context-specific analysis about whether, in practice, this particular position is expected to transmit the faith through that way. I certainly wouldn't say that categorically those individuals are -- are either out or in.
It will depend on what that means in practice. I just want to underscore here that the Ninth Circuit's decision is really the outlier decision.
So, with respect to all of these concerns about the repercussions, we're just asking you to eliminate the decision that has deviated from the general focus in the lower courts on a function-based approach. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rassbach, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Your Honor -- You don't have anything to rebut just yet. Yes, sorry. Mr. Fisher? Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the first half of the argument has illustrated the myriad problems with the important religious function test that's been proposed on the other side, both in terms of consequences.
For example, Mr. Rassbach readily admitted that -- you know, that all nurses in Catholic hospitals, for example, would be covered, and in terms of theory, as Justice Gorsuch's questions illustrated. So I think I want to focus on a narrower argument in this case that I hear the schools and the government making, which is that these particular teachers should be considered ministers, even though they did not have to be Catholic to have their job, simply because their job included teaching religion. And our position is the Court should reject this contention for three reasons. First, the school's argument would strip more than 300,000 lay teachers in religious schools across the country of basic employment law protections, and necessarily included in this number are teachers who teach so-called secular classes. This has been a focus of a lot of questioning this morning, so I want to emphasize this.
The Court itself in Catholic Bishop in many cases has said in no uncertain terms that there's no way to distinguish a teacher who teaches religion in a religious school from a teacher who teaches general curriculum or a secular course infused with religion. And, in fact, the schools in amici from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to the American Jewish Committee in their amicus briefs are at absolute pains to underscore this reality.
They emphasize that, ""All teachers in religious schools infuse their instruction with religious doctrine"" regardless of whether of they teach ""religious or secular subjects, such as math and science."" And the concrete examples the Court has offered already I think make this readily apparent, but let me give you a couple more. Imagine the English teacher who teaches rhetoric using the Sermon on the Mount or the history teacher who during Passover describes the exodus from Egypt or who explores divine will through Lincoln's second inaugural address or the science teacher who teaches creationism or intelligent design. I don't really understand what the other side means when they talk about de minimis teaching of religion or outlier, I think was the word Ms. Ratner used.
All teachers in religious schools are in play in this case necessarily. Secondly -- Mr. Fisher, I -- I think it's fair to describe your position compared to your friend's on the other side as more formalistic in using that word in a non-pejorative sense.
You're -- you're much more focused on titles, I would think, than whether or not they're performing religious functions. And my concern is -- it was one raised by the concurring opinion in Hosanna-Tabor, is that different faiths put different stock in -- in titles.
In some that are more hierarchal, they're important.
In others, they're not. And the second concern is that that's pretty manipulable.
You know, if you want broad protection, you just start handing out titles to everybody, and then they would be covered. I'd like your reaction to that. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just so that our position is to be absolutely clear is the Court should adhere to the multi-factor framework that Hosanna-Tabor laid out, which starts with what we would call objective factors. Yes, one of those factors is the formal title of the individual but also things like the individual's training, whether the individual has to be of the same religion, et cetera, we think are good places for courts to start because, as the Court has mentioned, the entanglement problems here are extraordinary once a court turns to assessing religious doctrine and what is important and what -- how religious values come into play. So, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked also about manipulation.
I think you've actually had a little bit of a case study in the last eight years since Hosanna-Tabor was announced, and what you see in the guides that we cite at pages 35 to 37 of our brief is religious employers looking to claim broad protection of the ministerial exception are being told to put things into their handbooks about the importance of the religious functions of the employees and to assign them daily prayer activities and the like. They're not being given special titles and the like, and we think the reason why is that titles themselves, even on their own terms, are meaningful things.
You can look across all sectors of American society, including churches, to see that. But, again, Mr. Chief Justice, we wouldn't rely solely on titles.
We would just say it's an important thing to start with titles, just like the Court did in Hosanna-Tabor. Justice Thomas? Yes.
Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Fisher, just first a just general question.
Would exactly what these teachers were doing be a violation if they did it in a public school, be a violation of the Establishment Clause if they did it in a public school? Well, Justice Thomas, I think there's a yes-and-no answer to that.
I think some of the religious teaching might step over the line, but, of course, it's commonplace for religion to be taught in public schools. And let me -- let me clarify one thing that came up in the first half of the argument with Mr. Rassbach, for example, about teaching devotionally in a religious school.
The document Lay Catholic -- Lay Teachers in Catholic Schools, which is cited in the other side's amicus briefs as kind of the touch point for what it means to teach Catholicism as a lay person, tells Catholic teachers that when they're -- even when they're in public schools, they should teach devotionally. So it's not simply the idea that a Catholic person is supposed to be a witness of the faith or even try to persuade other people to become Catholic.
That would be somehow different in a religious school -- Well, let's -- I don't want to cut you off, Mr. Fisher, but what if they -- it's my understanding they actually led them from time to time in prayer or took them to service, things like that. That's what I mean.
Just let's take not the sort of the minimal performance of their duty but sort of their standard week-to-week performance, what could they do at the local public school? I think, Justice Thomas, the answer to that is -- is no, the prayer and worship would step over the line.
But I don't think that tells you anything meaningful for in terms of what a minister is, because if prayer and worship were enough, then you'd have not just the football coach or the administrator who gives the morning prayer over the loudspeaker in school, but you'd have the nurses in Catholic hospitals, you'd have the teenagers at summer camps who are camp counselors who lead their campers in a prayer every night. So prayer is one thing to look at, but, Justice Thomas, we don't think it's enough to make somebody a minister. But don't you think it's a bit odd that -- that things that would violate the Establishment Clause, when done in a public school, are not considered religious enough for free exercise protection when done in a parochial school? Well, Justice Thomas, I wholeheartedly agree that free exercise protection is available in this case.
And I want to make clear that any religious reason for firing these teachers or for otherwise regulating the teachers would be entitled to the highest free exercise protection. But what the other side needs to prove is that there's an Establishment Clause violation in this case with -- going forward. And we think that is something that requires more than simply leading people in prayer or the like.
It requires being a leader in the church. It requires not just being a member but a -- a person in who the stewardship of the congregation has been placed. And that's what raises the kind of Establishment Clause problem we think the ministerial exception is concerned with. So the -- you -- you rely somewhat on the, as the Chief Justice said in a non-pejorative way, ministerial designation.
How would you determine that, especially when we look at these non-hierarchal religions that do not use priesthood or pastor and that sort of a -- a designation? Well, I think, Justice Thomas, the best way to do that in a -- in a religion that didn't use the kind of titles that the Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church use would be to do what Judge Wilkinson did in the Rayburn case, which is to say that if the person is performing all of the same things as -- as -- as -- as what would typically come with a title, then that may well be quite relevant. And I hasten to add, I just don't want to give the appearance that our test relies simply on title.
The very next thing Hosanna-Tabor looked at was the training reflected in that title. And so -- and so, even in a religion that isn't hierarchal, you're -- you're most likely going to have significant religious training of the kind Ms. Perich had in the Hosanna-Tabor case in play when you deal with a religious leader or the head of a congregation or the like.
And so even -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg? I have the same question you were answering about discriminating against some hierarchical religions.
And you're saying even those people may have special training that distinguishes them from the lay members of the congregation? I think that will be true quite often, Justice Ginsburg.
As I said, I think the Rayburn case is a very good example in that respect, which is, of course, the foundational case for the concept of the ministerial exception. One other thing I'd like to add, which is I think it is correct, and we agree with the premise, that different religions ought to be treated equally.
But there's nothing, I don't think, that should require the Court therefore to have all people who perform exactly the same functions across all religions be treated the same. And if I could offer a rough analogy. Think about the Eleventh Amendment immunity that applies to states.
Different states structure their own government differently.
They have different forms of administrative bodies.
Some have much bigger administrative bodies than others.
And so different people in different states that perform roughly the same thing are sometimes going to get Eleventh -- are sometimes going to trigger Eleventh Amendment immunity and sometimes they're not. We wouldn't say, therefore, that we're treating those states unequally.
We would say we're respecting the decisions, those choices -- those schools -- I'm sorry, those states have made. And so too here, I think part of respecting religion and staying out of religion is respecting the ex ante decisions that churches themselves make about how to structure their hierarchies and who to give -- who -- who, as the words of Hosanna-Tabor put it, ""in whom to put their faith."" You don't seem to make much out of what I find very disturbing in all this, that the person can be fired or refused to be hired for a reason that has absolutely nothing to do with religion, like needing to take care of chemotherapy. Justice Ginsburg, I don't want to give that impression at all.
We think that's actually the center of the case in terms of how this Court should think about it, and this also connects up, I think, with Justice Breyer's question. It's not just that there's a exemption in the statute for hiring people of the same faith.
It's that anytime a religion -- I'm sorry, anytime a religious employer wants to hire and fire or take other employment actions for religious reasons, the statutes themselves let them do that.
And if -- and if for some reason even then the statute doesn't give them what they want, they can raise the Free Exercise Clause. So the only place the ministerial exception really matters is in a case where the religion is not acting for religious reasons. And so that's this case, I think, Justice Ginsburg, as you have said, with Ms. Biel and her cancer treatments and with Morrissey-Berru being fired simply because, she alleges, she got too old, is that those are the cases where the ministerial exception matters. And maybe this is the way I would say, stripped of all the labels, I think, which can make the case sound more complicated than it is, I think the best way to think about this case is to say when does a church require or, sorry, I should say a religious employer require absolute categorical immunity to hire and fire people for whatever reason they want, whether it be race discrimination, whether it be any -- any other thing that doesn't have anything to do with their religion, and when, on the other hand, is it enough, with respect to an employee, to say, of course, you have an important stake in how they perform their religious functions and duties, and if you have a problem with that, you're allowed to fire them or discipline them or anything else, but you can't -- you just simply can't do it for non-religious reasons? And our submission here, just to -- just to finish that thought, is we think when it comes to lay teachers, the 300,000 lay teachers in Catholic schools and other religious schools across the country, not to mention the 1- or 200,000 more teachers in religious universities and colleges, that we think when you talk about those people, it is enough to serve the religions' legitimate interest to say if you have a problem with how they're teaching religion or how they're otherwise upholding themselves in light of your faith, you can hire or fire them.
But you can't say, we don't care when you come in whether you're of our religion and we don't care when we fire you about anything to do with religion, but we still get immunity.
We think that's a bridge too far. Thank you. Justice Breyer? You said, counsel -- thank you very much.
You -- you said that what we're looking for is where is it courts should really stay out in respect to a religion that we will not even look if this defendant committed a violation of a statute that has nothing to do with religion.
Justice Ginsburg went on about that. All right.
That's what the case does hold, Tabor.
But who are those people? And we called them ministers.
But they were people in positions of leadership or authority.
But we know some religions, everyone has that kind of position.
Other religions, no.
Some religions think people without education are the ones to be the ministers.
Others might think vast education. All right.
Given that circumstance and the desire not to have us meddle too much and to keep the religion independent, what advice can you give us? What should we write in these -- I can -- you know, we can start by saying leadership or authority, but what else can we write that will -- or what -- what should we write to, say, guide the lower courts so they don't meddle too much? Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer that in -- first in terms of theory and second in terms of the experience in the courts for the past several decades. In terms of theory, I think you're absolutely right to be concerned about entanglement, and that's why we say the first thing you should write is the same thing you wrote at the beginning of Hosanna-Tabor, which is that to the extent that ministerial status can be gleaned from objective factors, that's where courts ought to look.
They ought to look to the ex ante designations that religions themselves make. When that -- when that isn't a conclusive answer, yes, we can look at functions, but we have to be very careful when we do, and that ought not drive the analysis. The other side's test, I don't think that even in the entire first half of the argument I ever -- ever heard a meaningful definition of what an important religious function is.
And if that were the sole test, I -- I -- I respectfully submit you're going to have just impossible entanglement problems. Even they concede the janitor, maybe the administrator, although that has been argued by other religious institutions in the past, but they seem to concede it.
So there's going to have to be a line drawn in the way of what's the best path forward. And so let me then tell you in terms of practical terms what I think is important, which is, before Hosanna-Tabor, as the Court and the concurrence by Justice Alito stressed, there had been several decades of the ministerial exception in the lower courts.
The position we're advocating today is consistent with the overwhelming weight of that authority. So I can not only give you my theory today, but I can lend you the practical assurance that for several decades in the lower courts -- and this all -- these are all gathered in Footnote 1 of our red brief -- the courts consistently held that lay teachers in religious schools, even if they taught some religion, were outside the ministerial exception. And so that line was durable and workable, and, indeed, the federal government brought many of those cases and established that rule and had that rule across several administrations for many decades. So it's a little bit like the Maui case, Justice Breyer, where you have hard lines to draw, but you can take some comfort with decades of experience in lower courts and the government's own position that prevailed until the moment of this case right now. So I think that actually should help bolster my position just in practical terms because, if you write an opinion that says all important religious functions trigger the ministerial exception, I don't think there's just any way to escape you're going to have the cases with the nurses, you're going to have the cases with the football coaches, you're going to have the cases with the summer counselors. The only thing the other side says to that in our brief is, well, those cases haven't been brought so much.
But my answer to that is that just shows how revolutionary their case would be, because there's no good answer to those cases, and Mr. Rassbach himself said this morning that nurses would be covered. We found several cases recently where nurses brought employment discrimination cases that weren't even -- the ministerial exception wasn't even raised in those cases.
So now you're talking about hundreds of thousands of nurses being stripped of their employment law protections. And this is the last thing I'd say in terms of practical consequences.
Remember that we're not just talking about employment discrimination laws here.
I know Hosanna-Tabor tailored the opinion that way, as Ms. Ratner properly said, but the lower courts have said that the ministerial exception applies to the Fair Labor Standards Act, as has the federal government, Equal Pay Act, many other statutes, and also just ordinary state law credentialing. Many state -- many states have laws that say teachers have to have a certain amount of education or training or that they have to have certain criminal background checks or -- or the like.
I don't see how you can uphold the constitutionality of any of those laws or requirements under the other side's test, which the theory is that for all lay teachers in Catholic schools or other religious schools who are teaching religion, the government can have nothing to do with what reasons those people are hired or fired for or what their qualifications might be. Justice Alito? This issue can come up in many, many, many different contexts, as the questioning this morning has brought out, but what is before us is a very specific case or, rather, two very specific similar cases, and it has to do with teachers in a religiously affiliated elementary school. So suppose these teachers taught in a secondary school and they taught exactly one subject and that is religion.
Students came for 50 minutes a day and they had a religious class and it was taught by these teachers. Would they qualify? Justice Alito, is your assumption in that hypothetical that they -- that those teachers have no other indicia of ministerial status, that they don't have any special training or title or the like? Well, they have -- they have the training that the school thinks is sufficient and they are not labeled minister. Do you appreciate that the very term, minister, treats different religions differently? It is a predominantly Christian/Protestant term.
And as you apply it to other religions, it becomes -- its application becomes less and less clear. So they do one thing, they teach religion, and they have the title of teacher of religion in a Catholic school. Well, Justice -- Do they qualify? -- Justice Alito, I think it's -- the reason I ask, and I apologize, is that I think it's going to be an uncommon situation where that person is going to have no other formal indicia of ministerial status. Does now having -- But if you had that sort of a case -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Oh, I'm sorry.
If you had that sort of a case, we think that person would probably not be a minister still, but you don't have to decide that here obviously. Why would that person not be a minister? The person wouldn't be a minister in that case because I think -- at least arguably, because even then the person would not be assuming a person -- a place -- a position of spiritual leadership of the congregation.
And we think that's what the core of the ministerial exception is about. And, Justice Alito, maybe it helps -- Why was that the core -- -- for me to -- -- of the -- I would be more comfortable if we jettisoned the whole term ""ministerial exception"" because I do think it's discriminatory, but why is there less of a religious autonomy issue and why is there not a very central religious autonomy issue there? The -- the function of teaching a religion to new generations is central. Yeah, Justice Alito, I don't deny that for one minute, and I think that is why the schools have every -- every ability to make free exercise arguments because of the absolute centrality of that function. But remember -- and I'm happy to jettison the ""ministerial exception"" label. What we're really talking about here is when are the schools or when are religious employers immune.
When are they -- what does it -- when do they need absolute, what some courts call ecclesiastical immunity? And to get there, you need not just free exercise concerns in play but you need Establishment Clause concerns in play. And I think, Justice Alito, with all fairness, you've identified what I would think of as the edge case, which is a case where somebody teaches religion full-time as their job but doesn't have any other ministerial -- Well, what is the difference -- -- considerations in play. -- what is the fundamental difference between that situation and the situation of an elementary school teacher who teaches everything, including religion? And for a school that is set up by a religious body, the teaching of religion is central. That is why -- that's the very reason why these schools are set up.
Otherwise, there would be no reason.
The students could go to the -- to the public school and not have to pay any tuition.
So it's central to their mission and the fact that it is done by -- in an elementary school by one teacher who teaches everything, including religion, why should that make a difference whether it's structured that way or it's structured as it might be in a secondary school? I think the difference, Justice Alito, is when somebody teaches only religion and nothing else, their stature is as more of an expert on the faith and a preacher of the faith. When you have somebody who is a general curriculum teacher and who just happens to pick up the workbook for 40 minutes a day and teach religion during that segment of the day, that person isn't seen, I don't think, as -- as holding the same degree of position in -- in the church hierarchy in terms -- in terms of church leadership. And remember, Justice Alito, I don't think there's any possible way to distinguish the general curriculum teacher who teaches religion 40 minutes a day from the science teacher, the history teacher, the English teacher, who probably, once you tally up the number of minutes in that day where religion comes into play, is teaching at least 40 minutes worth of religion if not anything more. So just in terms of consequences, Justice Alito, you take a step from a very small group of teachers in schools to hundreds of thousands of teachers in K through 12 across the country -- Well, we may not -- -- and many hundreds of thousands more. -- we may or may not take the step, but that -- that -- those other teachers are not at issue here.
What is at issue here is exactly -- is an elementary school teacher who teaches religion as well as other things. Well, Justice Alito, just in terms of numbers, I think even there you have, I think, about 150,000 teachers in front of you in this case that as -- as the lower court case law developed for Hosanna-Tabor were never considered to be ministers. And I don't -- as I said, just with all due respect, I don't think there's any meaningful way to distinguish, as the Catholic bishops brief says, as the American Jewish Committee brief says, as the Catholic colleges brief says, all these briefs are on the other side of the case of mine -- from me, they all stress there's no way to distinguish somebody who teaches a secular subject with religion infused from somebody who teaches as my clients did in this case. Justice Sotomayor? Mr. Fisher, I understand the government supported Mrs. Biel just two years ago in the Ninth Circuit -- Correct. -- and argued that merely teaching two hours per week, spent teaching religion, that that didn't qualify her as a minister. It's now said something -- Ms. Ratner said something that has taken me by surprise, which is she seems to be saying that the Ninth Circuit got this particular case wrong because they were using labels as talismanic. Did you understand that argument by her? And, if you did, why is she wrong? Well, I -- I -- I think just in terms of what the Ninth Circuit did, the court was at -- was clear to say that we're not simply resting this on the absence of the label minister, but we're looking at all the factors in Hosanna-Tabor itself and saying that, overall, in the totality of the circumstances, there are not enough here. The Ninth Circuit also said in its opinion that no other court has deemed teachers like these to be ministers ever before that had so little religious leadership as part of their -- their duties. And they were -- the Ninth Circuit was right about that.
They were right even after Hosanna-Tabor.
There's only one case that's close, which is out of the Seventh Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit distinguished that case, but, more generally, as I said, the Ninth Circuit's outcome here was not just what the government asked for, it's what the government itself asked for for decades, going all the way back to the President Reagan administration, is that lay teachers who teach some religion are on one side of the scale, and other people who are core spiritual leaders in seminary schools and the like are on the other hand -- are on the other side of the scale. So it really is a sea change -- even as to teachers, leaving everything else aside, it is truly a sea change that is being requested by the other side here today in terms of how teachers in schools are classified and whether they have any employment rights at all or -- or, in fact, whether at least if you follow the way the lower courts have -- have implemented the ministerial exception, you basically have employment law-free zones in all religious schools. The Fourth Circuit in Rayburn used the ""primarily religious function"" test.
You haven't adopted that or even spoke about it in your brief. Can you tell me what you think the strengths or limits of that test might be? Justice Sotomayor, we think that Hosanna-Tabor is consistent with Rayburn and indeed -- and also consistent with our test.
What Rayburn did is it dealt with a case where a -- a person applied for a position called a pastoral care position. And even though the woman in that case who applied for the position didn't have a ministerial title, what Judge Wilkinson said is because of the way this church is structured, it was Seventh-day Adventist, doesn't give women ordained titles, that cannot be determinative. And we agree with that.
We say that function should be a cross-check, function should be part of the analysis to make sure that you're not disadvantaging minority religions or otherwise being too formalistic in the analysis. So we agree with what Judge Wilkinson said. I think what -- what might be the disconnect between what you're hearing from the different parties in this case is it's true that the other side can pull a quote out of Rayburn and pull a quote out of cases both before and after Hosanna-Tabor that say function should be what controls. But I think what you find if you look at all those cases is those are all cases where there really truly was an exceptional circumstances at play, where there were special reasons, like in Rayburn, why the more objective factors didn't provide the right answer.
And, again, we agree that then function does -- does have an enhanced role in that circumstance. But another way to answer the question, Justice Sotomayor, is to say remember, we're asking for what lower courts have done on the ground; just make it concrete and say what were lay teachers' status for the decades up to and even after Hosanna-Tabor. And the status was non-ministers.
And there's no way to reconcile those holdings, those concrete holdings, with the other side's view that, first of all, the controlling inquiry is whether somebody performs any important religious functions, and, secondly, what the government and now Petitioners themselves say, which is you defer to the religious employers themselves as to that question. If that were the real test, you would have millions of people falling within the ministerial exception.
And I don't see how you could make any sense of what the lower courts have done for decades if that were the test. Thank you. Justice Kagan? Mr. Fisher, I'd like to take you back to Justice Alito's questions, because some of what you said surprised me. With respect to a teacher who is a full-time teacher of religion, teaching religious doctrine, teaching religious practice, teaching religious texts, any of those things, I would have thought that Hosanna-Tabor, even though it has the thing about commissioning and title and so forth, you know, thinks of those people whose job it is to teach religion and to basically bring up the next generation in important understandings of religious doctrine and practice, that those people would be covered. But you said no, and so I wanted to just sort of say why? Justice Kagan, I think what I said is I think that's the hardest case for me.
That's the edge case. And I can make arguments both ways that I really wouldn't have to win here.
I think what I really want to do is persuade you that those people are different from the lay teachers that I represent here. But just to answer your question directly, I do think that somebody who did only that function and had no other training, title, or -- or even had to be of the same state to perform that job, I think that that person -- you could still question whether that person is central to the establishment of religion. Remember, I think there would be very strong free exercise interests in play there, but that particular person, I don't think, is involved with establishing the church.
But, as I said, Justice Kagan, I -- I -- I freely admit you can disagree with me on that and draw the line between people who teach religion full-time and people who are otherwise lay teachers teaching a general curriculum or teaching a secular subject with religion infused. Well, where do we draw that line then? I mean, suppose that I think that the full-time religion teacher is -- is protected by this exemption. Then I think Justice Alito raises a fair point here.
It's like, well, in an elementary school, maybe you have to teach some other subjects too, so maybe it's a half-time religious teacher or maybe it's a quarter-time. Where do we draw that line? I think that line holds up pretty well, Justice Kagan just in terms of just the basic idea that somebody teaching religion all day is going to be different than somebody teaching it just for a small part of the day as part of a general curriculum. And maybe this is the way to think about it, Justice Kagan.
This -- even if you strip away all the other objective factors, the school is going to hire somebody under slightly different criteria, with a different idea in mind to be the religion teacher in a school, compared to somebody who's going to be the general curriculum teacher. So, yes, religion in a Catholic school or other religious school may be particularly important, but just like science and math and all the other subjects, the -- the school isn't necessarily going to think that this person needs to be a leader and an expert in that field to hold the position. And -- and -- and what of the question of whether the person is a member of the faith? And, you know, as I suggested to Ms. Ratner, I was surprised by the emphasis that they put on that, but, on the other hand, I suppose I can think of there -- there -- you know, a -- a -- a yeshiva says that there's a non-Jewish great Talmud scholar and -- and -- and hires that person.
Why shouldn't that person count? Justice Kagan, we do not think that -- that co-religion is an -- is an on/off switch.
We just think it's a very, very strong objective factor in our column in this case, and it ought to be an important objective factor. The way Hosanna-Tabor put it, and I think the way you put it earlier in the argument, was whether somebody was not just a member of the faith but a special person within the membership of the faith who -- who is -- has the stewardship over that congregation or that religion.
And it's just a very, very odd thing to say that somebody who is not even a member of the faith and may fervently believe in a different faith is somehow a minister of that religion. And, Justice Kagan, I think that hypothetical is what really does a good job of prying apart the two different strands of constitutional law in the First Amendment that are relevant here. Absolutely, when a school hires a teacher to, say, teach religion to our students, and even do it devotionally if you can, that is something on which the school has very, very strong free exercise interests in.
And so they can immediately fire that person if they're not pleased with the way the person is teaching their religion or anything else. But we just don't think that's an Establishment Clause question.
It's a very odd thing to say the -- that the government is establishing religion by saying to a school, for positions where you don't even care whether the person is of your religion, and you hire and fire them for reasons that have nothing to do with your religion, you're entitled to categorical -- categorical immunity for those decisions because of the First Amendment.
That just seems like an odd conclusion and I think tells you there's something wrong with the analysis on the other side. Thank you. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, so we've gone from the full-time religion teacher to the part-time religion teacher, and the line that I'm -- I'm trying to -- I'm struggling with that you're drawing there is the part-time teacher's less important, but what if the school can't afford one, a full-time teacher? Maybe they can only afford a part-time teacher. You -- you mentioned that you thought it important that they be part of the faith, but then you withdrew from that a bit, recognizing that one could be part of another faith and also minister in this faith, Protestants, Catholics, different reform sort of Jews, whatever. So where -- I'm struggling with where you draw the line and -- and how much entanglement you're -- you're going to get us -- both sides are going to get us in here in deciding what's an important enough person in -- in a particular faith and how we avoid that, that difficulty. So, Justice Gorsuch, let me talk first about the part-time hypothetical and then the importance and entanglement. On the part-time question, I -- I may not fully understand your hypothetical, but I -- but I -- but I think that if a school said we're limited funds, we want -- teaching religion in our school is very important to us, but we don't have the funds to hire a full-time religion teacher, we're just going to hire a part-time teacher, I think that whatever answer you would give to the full-time religion teacher who taught only religion would also apply to the part-time -- Okay, let me change -- -- teacher. -- the hypothetical then.
What if -- what if the members of the congregation believed that all persons are ministers of the faith, bishops maybe even, and that they are all equally capable of teaching religion and -- and that's something they all wish to do part-time while also teaching other subjects? Well, Justice Gorsuch, I think that Hosanna-Tabor itself, you know, if you're talking about that in terms of a labeling exercise, Hosanna-Tabor itself said that -- that that would not be enough. And I think that just again highlights the real issue in front of the Court.
It's not whom the religion considers to be its ministers or even whom the religion considers to be performing its most important religious functions. It's who among employees of religious employers are performing such -- such vital duties to the establishment of the church that any qualification requirements or any legal enforcement having to do with their rights or -- or qualifications would necessarily run afoul of the Establishment Clause? And I think if we just get away from labels, I wholeheartedly agree there are enormous entanglement questions in asking what is important or -- or -- or even who -- who religions consider to be their minister. I think the very problem with the other side's test, and if -- and you just read the materials that we've cited and they will tell you is it is very clear that the other -- that -- that religious employers sincerely and deeply believe that all of their nurses, all of their teachers, even all of their administrators and janitors are performing important religious functions in terms of the religious mission of that church, and so that can't be the question. And so I think the question is the legal question arising from the First Amendment as to who is involved with the establishment of the church.
That's the only way you can get to immunity. And so I think perhaps a -- perhaps just that first principles approach or even that textual approach kind of helps shed some light on the situation and keep courts a little more on the law side of the line -- Mr. Fisher -- -- and a little less on the religion. -- you say that we -- we -- we -- we -- we can't -- we can't -- we shouldn't focus on -- on their sincerely held religious beliefs, but that is what we do elsewhere in -- in First Amendment jurisprudence.
We don't second-guess those sincerely held religious beliefs. Why -- why would we do it here and second-guess who they deem a minister? No, that's my point, Justice Gorsuch.
I don't think you should second-guess what -- well -- well, let me be clear here.
I don't think you should second-guess what religious institutions define as their own religious beliefs or values. I don't think you should second-guess whether they sincerely believe that employees perform important religious functions.
But that just shows that that can't possibly be the right test here. And I think your earlier questions pointed that out.
And so you're exactly right, that courts should stay out of that business. And so what's the solution then? Well, we think what the solution is, is that these courts should look to the objective factors that are outlined in Hosanna-Tabor, the things that are more legalistic and the things that are more ex ante decisions of the church as to who to designate as its spiritual leaders. And then ask that legal question about -- about function and duties through the lens of the Establishment Clause as a matter of first principles.
We think it's telling, Justice Gorsuch, that for centuries of history that is discussed on the other side of this case, there's not one single example of a person who was not a titled member of the clergy receiving the kind of protection they're being requested today. We think if there were this deeply rooted First Amendment rule that they're describing, there would be thousands of cases, millions of cases because they're talking about expanding who is covered by the ministerial exception from primarily people that have objective indicia of ministerial status to making them truly the minority among a sea of employees, just -- just teachers alone, who have important religious duties but have never been thought to fall within the ministerial exception. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good afternoon and welcome, Mr. Fisher.
I want to start with a question that comes from the amicus brief of the Milwaukee Jewish Day School.
They say that the Ninth Circuit's approach, the more formalistic or objective approach, means that, in their words, ""Jewish schools have fared markedly worse"" under that test, under the Ninth Circuit's formulation at least of that test. I want to get your reaction to that and how we can prevent that. Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I haven't seen any empirical proof for that statement, and we don't see why that would be the case. Remember, the Ninth Circuit itself harmonized its decision with the Seventh Circuit's Grussgott case, which dealt with the Jewish Day School and said that even there, the teacher had special training to be teaching in that school and that teacher may well be different. And -- and, Justice Kavanaugh, if I would just return you -- I know I've said this before, but the cases we cite in red brief -- in our red brief in Footnote 1 deal with schools of the Christian faith, of Jewish faith, and I think even some other faiths. And across the board, we see a consistent treatment of lay teachers like our clients here being outside of the ministerial exception.
So -- Okay.
The next question is: In terms of formulating the legal test, as the Court said in Hosanna-Tabor, it's enough in the first case just to list the factors.
We may have to refine that in this case. If we refined it by adopting Justice Alito's concurrence, what would be the problems, if any, with that from your perspective? Well, I -- I think the -- we agree with much of the concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh.
We agree that title -- certainly, the -- certainly, the moniker minister but that titles more generally shouldn't be determinative. And we -- and we agree that function is important.
And we further agree, as I was just saying, that what the Court ought to do, particularly if it wants to be careful in this highly sensitive area, is follow the vast experience of the lower courts. Now where I depart from the concurrence -- and I -- and I -- and I just -- this is just my own difficulty understanding it, is that concurrence leaves out all of the cases that we cite in Footnote 1 of our -- of our brief.
So the concurrence on the one hand says we're saying to be consistent with past law but then suggests -- I think you're right, Justice Kavanaugh, has some suggestions that perhaps -- perhaps a broader ministerial exception for teachers would be appropriate. Okay. And I think the way that we would tell the Court -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to get another question or two in. You mentioned earlier a religious teacher who just picks up -- a religion teacher who just picks up the handbook and you referred to someone like that having no training. And I -- I guess I would question the training point.
There's no way to do this empirically, but my guess is a lot of religion teachers would say their life is their training. Well, Justice Kavanaugh -- How would you respond to that? Well, I -- I -- I think -- I think I'd respond to that by returning to one of Mr. Rassbach's own answers when he was asked is it enough to be a model or a witness. I think he said no. And so I think there's something more than being a model of the faith or using your own personal experience because I don't see how you would distinguish the teachers in this case if that were the -- a proper touchstone from the hundreds of thousands or millions of other employees of religious institutions who are told in their handbooks, in their contracts, by their supervisors to carry out themselves during work hours and their lives according to the faith. Thank you very much, Mr. Fisher. Thank you, Mr. Fisher.
You have a minute or so to wrap up if you'd like. Thank you.
Did I hear somebody else wanted to ask a question? Okay. Thank -- thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. With no other questions, I'll just simply return the Court to what I think is important to bear in mind as the overall question in this case, which is when is categorical immunity required on the one hand and when is it not enough to say you're -- you're entitled as a statutory matter to choose people of your own religion to work for you and you're also entitled as a statutory matter and as a free exercise matter to hire and fire and set their terms and conditions of employment according to your religious values. And we think the lay teachers here fall on the latter side of the line.
It is enough to give the schools in this case the ability to hire, fire, discipline, and otherwise set the terms and conditions of employment according to their religious values. And it is too much and it would blow a hole in our nation's civil rights laws and our employment laws in general to say that categorical immunity applies and so schools can pay people different amounts, use race, sex, other private characteristics even when they have nothing to do with the religion and the religious values at stake. So we ask the Court to affirm. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rassbach, two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A -- a few points.
The first is that the proof is in the pudding, and we have the pudding here.
The ministerial exception has been working well for decades and has been using the functional consensus both before and after Hosanna-Tabor. And you look at pages 8 through 9 of the yellow brief, we explain that there are other cases where lay teachers and -- and have been decided under -- under the functional test. So there -- I would advert to the fact that the -- the federal government said there are three buckets, pastors, musicians, teachers. Teacher cases are common and they get decided under the functional consensus all the time. And I would say post-Hosanna-Tabor, there's been a real crystallization among the lower courts around the Alito concurrence in Hosanna-Tabor. By contrast, the Respondents' test has never been used.
And their claims of things like, you know, nurses, lots and lots of nurse cases -- there haven't been nurse cases in four decades.
There's not going to start being a lot now. There's no need to decide the co-religionist issue in this case.
In this case, they -- they are -- they were co-religionists and both schools wanted their teachers to be Catholic, just like in Hosanna-Tabor, when there were non- -- not people from that same religion that were used -- there were sometimes gap fillers employed. And, finally, this is a heartland case.
These teachers are the primary teacher of the faith.
They are the stewards of the faith. They are the leaders of their classroom.
They -- they -- the function of teaching the next generation is central, as Mr. Fisher just conceded.
These -- these are the people who will teach the faith to the next generation.
If -- if they don't do it, no one else will. The decisions below would replace Hosanna-Tabor's well-designed framework for deciding delicate church/state questions with a constitutional thicket.
They should be reversed. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-801, Peter versus NantKwest. Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An unsuccessful patent applicant may seek judicial review through either a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141 or a district court suit under Section 145. Section 145 states that an applicant who files suit under that provision must pay all the expenses of the proceeding. The question presented here is whether those expenses include money that the PTO spends to employ lawyers and paralegals who assist with the agency's defense of the suit. For three principal reasons, the answer to that question is yes.
First, the term ""expenses"" unambiguously encompasses costs -- encompasses money paid to employees or other personnel to accomplish an -- a particular task. And unlike the term ""costs,"" which has a similarly broad common meaning, this Court has not construed the term ""expenses"" as a legal term of art with a more limited scope. Second, requiring patent applicants who file suit under Section 145 to pay personnel expenses of the PTO is consistent with the overall statutory scheme.
Congress has directed the PTO to charge fees that are sufficient to cover its aggregate operating costs, including personnel expenses. And the PTO has developed fee schedules that, in a rough and ready way, require applicants who cause the agency to incur greater expenses to -- to pay more in the way of fees.
And Section 145 applicants put the PTO to a particular expenses, and it's therefore consistent with the logic of the statute to require them to pay more. And, third, it's especially appropriate to require Section 145 plaintiffs to pay the PTO's personnel expenses because Section 141 is available as an alternative means of obtaining judicial review.
Section 141 is not a cut-rate or a substandard mode of judicial review.
It's ordinary, on the record, APA-style judicial review.
And it contains no requirement that the -- the applicant who chooses that course must pay the PTO's personnel expenses. And so -- Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, is there any other federal statute that provides for attorneys' fees on the basis of the word ""expenses"" alone? As you know, there are expenses and attorneys' fees, expenses including attorneys' fees.
But what other statute provides for attorneys' fees simply on the basis of the word ""expenses""? We're not aware of any, unless you include the trademark analogue to this provision.
And, presumably, the government's position on those two statutes will rise or fall together. We're -- we're frankly not aware of any other federal statute that uses the term ""expenses"" standing alone; that is, as -- as Your Honor's question suggests, when Congress has provided for shifting of expenses, it typically makes clear that it intends to provide for payment of attorneys' fees in -- in the course of doing that.
But sometimes it says expenses including attorneys' fees, sometimes expenses and attorneys' fees. How -- how about to the losing party? Are there other statutes that provide for fees, attorneys' fees, that are awarded against the prevailing party? I mean, the -- the only one we're aware -- there are -- there are two categories of those.
There are -- there are Sebelius versus Cloer, the vaccine act, and that was an unusual situation. There are also statutes that provide discretion to award attorneys' fees without specifying that the -- the person who receives the fees must obtain some degree of litigation success.
And in that context, the -- the Court has construed those discretionary provisions as requiring a degree of litigation of success. But I'd say a couple of things about that -- And it was called it a radical departure to do otherwise? Well, it -- it would be, in the context of ordinary fee-shifting provisions.
And I think this is an important point, that if you ask is it unusual, is it a departure from the norm, either to require a -- an adverse litigant to pay the government's personnel expenses or to require the prevailing party to pay, the answer is if you compare it to other adversarial litigation involving the government, yes, it is unusual. If you compare it to other stages of the patent application process, it's not unusual at all.
And so the PTO charges particular fees for application and examination.
Those fees -- the PTO doesn't try to fine-tune the process. It's determined that it would be administratively overly cumbersome to say to each applicant, you must pay in precise proportion to the work that you make the PTO do. But in a sort of rough and ready way, it's tried to create a scenario in which applicants who cause the PTO to pay -- to incur greater expenses must pay more.
So if your proposed patent has an unusually large number of claims, you may have to pay a larger fee.
If you seek continued examination or if you file an administrative appeal to the PTAB, you have to pay additional fees. And none of that is contingent on how the application is ultimately disposed of.
And so if your application is turned down by the examiner and you file an appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, the PTAB, and the PTAB says yes, you're right, the examiner missed the boat completely, you are entitled to your patent, you get a favorable disposition, but you still have to pay the appeal -- Well, the -- -- appeal fee to the PTAB -- for the PTAB proceeding. Counsel, your -- your interpretation of ""expenses"" includes attorneys' fees, you argue in this case.
Is there anything that would inhibit the government from suggesting that other forms of overhead might also be allocated to litigants? The electric bill? The sewage bill? Other things that were required in order to be able to litigate these cases? Well, the statute refers to expenses of the proceeding.
And so we would have to show the requisite connection -- Well -- -- to the -- -- you have a lawyer here, right, who works for the government anyway.
It's not like you went out and hired a lawyer.
So you're allocating some personnel expenses to this proceeding.
What would prohibit the government from allocating other expenses to this proceeding? Well, it certainly -- it's certainly true that, for some bookkeeping purposes, when we talk about personnel expenses, we will include what I think is referred to as a fully burdened rate -- Right. -- where we're talking not just about the salary but to some additional increments of money that are -- that go along with hiring a -- So nothing, in other words, right? A fully burdened rate would include this other form of overhead that we're talking about, right? I guess the point I would make is we -- we do that in the application process already. Oh, okay.
So you're already doing this? We're -- we're doing that in the application process in -- in the sense that we are under a congressional mandate to collect fees that, in the aggregate, are sufficient to cover -- Well, that's helpful to know that you're already doing this.
And it has been 170 years; is that right? That's right. How did the government just figure this out? Well, I think -- we don't have a good explanation for why we weren't doing it before.
We do have explanation -- good explanations for why we focused on this matter at the time that we did. But you would -- you would say that in all the years that you weren't doing it, you were violating the statute because the statute is mandatory and not discretionary? I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say that we were violating the statute.
That is, this is somewhat analogous to what the Court often refers to as a mandatory claim processing rule as opposed to a jurisdictional requirement. So, for instance, statutes of limitations are often phrased in terms of no suit shall be filed more than three years after the violation occurs.
But everybody understands that even though the -- the statute is phrased in mandatory terms, the defendant can waive or forfeit the limitations defense by failing to raise it at the appropriate moment. And nobody would say that the defendant violates the statute by failing to assert a limitations defense that it could have asserted. You -- So you -- I think we would have to say that for that 170-year period, we were foregoing a source of income that we were entitled to get. Are you going to -- You started by saying that the statutory term expenses unambiguously covers attorneys' fees.
So two questions on that. First, the cases seem to suggest that there is something of a clear statement rule in this area that has to explicitly, expressly cover fees and, two, all of the statutes that seem to satisfy that refer to attorneys, attorneys' fees, or fees, and not the term expenses. So which part of that do you disagree with? Oh, well, the Court has made clear that, even though a relatively clear indication of congressional intent is necessary, there's no magic words requirement.
And the point I was making about expenses being unambiguous is that there is no ordinary, plain language understanding of the word ""expenses"" that doesn't encompass the money that you use to hire a person to accomplish a particular task. And sometimes in situations like this, where Congress has used expansive general language, the Court has said the failure to specify particular items doesn't indicate ambiguity, it indicates breadth, that Congress could have -- I think that would be true if there weren't some kind of clear statement backdrop to this.
But my question is, you agree there is something of a clear statement requirement; is that correct? That's correct. Okay.
And then -- Does -- does -- may I interrupt for a second? Go -- go ahead. Does that mean you are dropping your argument in your initial brief that the American Rule doesn't apply to this kind of case, because in your reply brief you don't make any mention of that, and here in responding to Justice Kavanaugh's questions and in your first two minutes, you also don't make that argument again, have you effectively dropped that argument so we're now within the American Rule presumption? We -- we would certainly acknowledge that if this sentence didn't appear in Section 145 at all, we would need -- we would not be able to recoup personnel expenses. Now, the Fourth Circuit held that because the Section 145 mandate applies without regard to the ultimate outcome of the litigation, the American Rule doesn't apply. And we think the Federal Circuit -- the Fourth Circuit was right at least to the extent of saying the absence -- not only the absence of a prevailing party requirement, but the specific mandate that the expenses be paid regardless of the outcome of the proceedings is a good indication that this provision is trying to accomplish something very different from what an ordinary fee shifting provision is intended to accomplish. And so you can conclude on that basis the American Rule doesn't apply or you can conclude this is one of the contextual factors that leads you to the conclusion that personnel expenses are -- are encompassed.
And -- Are you -- are you going to send the Respondent a bill for your time today? We -- we are not.
And I think that's -- there -- there are really three different potential obstacles to our claiming an incremental share of my salary. The first is that the PTO has, even in the most recent years, has sought only expenses of PTO personnel, not of Department of Justice lawyers who's assisted -- who have assisted in the representation of Section 145 suits. And I think that's based on the idea this is a provision that is intended to help in making the PTO a self-financing agency.
It complements the requirement that the PTO collect fees to cover its own operating expenses, not that of other agencies. There -- there's a separate question also about whether an appellate stage of the case would fall within the -- the term proceedings in Section 145, and it's noteworthy in this regard that Section 141, which provides for direct appeal to the Federal Circuit, doesn't include an expense recoupment mandate. And I think you could infer from that fact that Congress intended only that the trial stage of the Section 145 proceedings, the thing that was distinctive to a Section 145 suit, to be subject to -- to this mandate. And the third thing is, even in the trial -- with respect to the trial court proceedings in this case, the PTO didn't seek recoupment of expenses for attorney time spent arguing about the fees. It -- it requested recoupment of expenses only for the attorney time that was devoted to the issue of patentability.
And the only issue before this Court, obviously, is recoupment of fees, not the original dispute. Mr. Stewart -- I can see the argument, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, that the word ""expenses"" could include attorneys' fees, but I don't understand the argument that expenses alone must include attorneys' fees. I think the argument -- the argument is simply, as a matter of plain language, no one would doubt that the money paid, excuse me, the money paid to PTO personnel in the course of the suit were part of the expenses that the PTO incurred. And the only question is whether the term expenses, like the term costs, has acquired a status as a legal term of art that has a legal meaning narrower than its common meaning.
And the Court has never used the term in that way. Indeed, in elucidating the term costs, the court has sometimes said, as in Taniguchi, cost has an ordinary meaning that's synonymous with expenses, but for purposes of federal cost shifting statute, it has a more narrow meaning. The -- the other thing I would say about costs is that when the Court says that the word ""costs"" is a term of art, it has a limited meaning, the Court has a source of law to look to to see whether particular items are or are not costs.
It looks to 28 U.S.C. 1821 and 28 U.S.C. 1920. And so when the Court says we are going to depart from the ordinary meaning of costs, it doesn't have to make things up.
It has a source of law to determine whether -- All right.
Sorry.
I don't want to cut you off. Whereas here, I think NantKwest has really given no guidance as to what it thinks the term ""expenses"" means, other than it doesn't include attorneys' fees, but we can't fault NantKwest for that because there really is no alternative source for determining what the term ""expenses"" means, if not its ordinary meaning. How should I deal with this fact.
As far as I can tell, if you go back to the 1830s when this was enacted, the patent litigants paid the costs, including the attorneys' fees of the Patent Office, didn't they? So you could say, well, this was just, where there are special costs here, this group should pay it, not everybody.
That made sense. But then in the 1860s, the government decides to pay for all these expenses.
Now it doesn't make much sense any more to have this group pay. Then in 1990 it goes back to the first system.
All right. So if it were just the one system or the other, I could make a lot of sense out of it, either saying these have special costs, the patent litigants pay anyway, let them pay, or I could say you are putting a special burden on this and it has to be clearer before you break the American Rule. But we have some of one and some of the other.
So what -- should I put -- use that to put weight on the fact nobody has ever thought of this before? Well, as -- as I say, I think this was an argument that could have been made for an extended period of time.
And we don't have a good explanation -- I -- -- for -- Don't know if it could have been made between 1865 and 18 -- and 1990. Well, the -- the -- Because during that time it was the Congress that paid these costs. Well -- well, there was still the objective of making the PTO a self-funded agency, an agency whose receipts were equivalent to its -- It already is. -- expenses. It already is. You're -- you're paying from the fees, meaning the time you're attributing to the attorneys and the paralegals is already being paid.
Without these fees, the patent application fee itself is covering it. You haven't had a shortfall. Well, the -- the PTO is under a congressional mandate to ensure that it's aggregate receipts match up with it's aggregate -- Now. -- expenditures. But was that true between 1865 and 1990? No, no.
It -- it -- No, it wasn't.
And, therefore, I'm having a big -- oddly enough, that's sort of what is giving me a problem here because -- and the long delay -- because I couldn't have said what you want me to say for over, well over 100 years. Well, the -- the mandate to pay the, I think it was the whole of the expenses of the proceeding under the original statute, the mandate was there all along and it was part of Congress's objective that the PTO be self-financing. Now, for a prolonged period of time, the way that Congress went about that was that, for the most part, Congress was determining the amount of the fees for particular services.
And it was trying to set fees at a level that would, as closely as possible, match up with PTO expenses.
Often there was a shortfall and an appropriation would be needed to fill the gap. In 2011, Congress essentially made it the PTO's responsibility to balance the books. It put the PTO under a mandate to make sure that your aggregate receipts equal your aggregate expenditures.
And once that responsibility was placed upon the agency, the agency felt a -- a greater duty to look for other sources -- I look to 1930, for example.
I'll discover that even in 1930 Congress was trying to get the patent fees to match the patent expenses.
They just didn't always do it right. It was certainly trying as much as possible -- Okay. -- to -- How do I -- where do I look for that. I -- I'm -- I'm not sure whether you would look for -- to -- to that. But the -- even in the 1830 act, '36 act, the statute said that fees that are paid into the Treasury, fees for patent application services, will be placed in a fund to be known as a patent -- as the patent fund to be used for the -- the salaries of the officers and clerks and other expenses of the agency.
And -- Mr. Stewart, do you dispute the Federal Circuit's estimate that if this cost of the PTO attorneys is spread among all patent applicants, even the ones who don't use 145, that the added cost per applicant would be $1.60? We don't.
And I think that the -- we don't dispute that.
And I think the PTO's motivation here is really more one of equity than of financial necessity.
That is, it is certainly true that the number of Section 145 suits is small enough that if the -- the applicant was not required to pay PTO personnel expenses, those could be allocated among all the hundreds of thousands of patent applicants and none of them would -- all of them would pay a very small amount. I think the PTO's motivation really is -- in -- in this case, for example, we sought about $111,000 in combined personnel expenses and expert witness fees.
It was a little under 80,000 for the -- the lawyers and paralegals, a little over 30,000 for the expert witnesses. And the PTO tells me that that -- that the fee application and examination fee for the typical patent application is about $3300.
So here we're dealing with a situation in which the Section 145 suit caused us to incur about 30 times the expenses that would ordinarily attend -- that would ordinarily be the fees for a patent application and examination. And it's one thing for the PTO to say: We're not going to fine tune this absolutely. We're going to accept the idea that some applicants will pay a little bit more; some applicants will pay a little bit less than their fair share of our operating expenses. But when we have this congressional mandate and when we have a situation whereby filing suit under Section 145, you've caused the PTO to incur 30 times the expenses that -- that go with a typical patent examination, it -- it seems fair and appropriate to make the applicant pay. And, again, part of our fairness argument is that Section 141 is available.
It provides exactly the type -- same type of judicial review that is ordinarily the only mode of judicial review that's available to somebody who's aggrieved by federal agency action. And so the applicant who -- who doesn't believe -- either doesn't want to pay the expenses or doesn't believe that its chances of success will be enhanced by filing suit in district court is -- the -- the 145 -- 141 mechanism is available -- I think you covered this, but just to confirm, however we rule in this case, will cover -- will affect only two statutory provisions? That's correct.
We're -- it -- it will certainly affect the -- the trademark statute and -- you know, basically our pitch in the certiorari petition was even though they are technically different statutes, our position would stand or fall together. We're not aware of any other statute that uses the term ""expenses"" standing alone in this context. And then in terms of your overall purpose argument, Congress wanted it to be a self-sustaining agency, but what sense does it make to think that Congress wanted the winning party to turn around and pay the government's legal fees, given how unusual that is? Why would Congress have thought to do it that way is, I -- I guess, what I'm asking. I guess the two reasons are Congress -- since the very beginning -- and the first iteration of the statute enacted in 1839 specifically said whether the decision is in its favor or not.
And the trademark statute continues to include that language. And even if you interpreted the term ""expenses"" very restrictively, as limited to costs under 1821 and 1920, it is no more usual to require the winning party to pay the other party's costs than for the winning party to have to pay the losing party's attorneys' fees. And so interpreting the -- You're saying the costs are obviously a far -- far smaller amount than -- They -- they -- -- attorneys' fees? -- yeah -- that's correct, but the -- It's unusual but not to the degree? It doesn't have the same practical effects.
But, again, the -- the point I would make, and I think this is in a sense our primary point, is you should -- the Court has described a Section 145 suit as a continuation of the examination process. And there is language in the statute to that effect.
It refers -- it says that the applicant shall pay all the expenses of the proceeding, rather than the plaintiff.
And so the applicant continues to retain that status throughout the lawsuit.
It says that the Court can adjudge that the applicant is entitled to a patent. And so when -- when you look to see is this unusual or not, you should compare it not just to other adversarial litigation involving the government; you should compare it to other stages of the patent application process.
And as I've said, at every other stage, your obligation to pay fees depends in part on how much work you're making the PTO do, but it doesn't depend at all on the ultimate outcome of the process. And so if you file a successful PTAB appeal and persuade the PTAB that the examiner got it wrong, you still have to pay the fees for the PTAB appeal even though in a sense you could say that's requiring the winning party to pay. If I may, I'll reserve the balance of my time. Certainly. Mr. Chu. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three important considerations.
First, the American Rule is a bedrock principle, and this Court has recognized and applied that rule for two centuries. Second, the government is arguing for a radical departure from the American Rule.
It is arguing that when a private party sues the government for its improper action, then that private party must pay for the government's attorneys, even if the government and its attorneys are flatly wrong. Third, and this responds to some of the questions from the justices that were put to the government, today there are 3,274 federal statutory provisions that use the word ""expenses"" without any reference to attorneys' fees or counsel fees. Some of those provisions are open-ended, as is the case here.
The government can point to not a one of those other provisions to say that the word ""expenses"" includes attorneys' fees, save for the two exceptions, radical exceptions, it is arguing here. And I would invite questions from the Court. Why -- why isn't this just like a filing fee? In other words, the applicant can take the normal appeal to the court of appeals, but if he or she wants to go through the much more elaborate proceeding of trying the case, bringing in new evidence, they have to pay a filing fee? I mean, in some agencies, I don't remember from long ago, the filing fee for a particular proceeding before the ICC was $100,000 because they figured most of the people who are going to be doing this, it's going to be corporations that can afford it, and we're -- you know, they're putting us out to a significant extent. Why -- I -- I gather -- I mean, would it be -- would it be problematic in your case if they said, okay, you can go to district court, but if you're going to do this unusual proceeding, you know, if you have three claims, that's going to be 15,000; if you have six, it is going to be 30,000; or what -- in other words, a significant filing fee for the very purpose of doing what the statute seems to contemplate? First, this is not a filing fee.
It's a claim for attorneys' fees against the strong backdrop of the American Rule. Second, this is not inside the Patent Office.
This is adversarial litigation.
This is where a private party says the government made a mistake, and I, private party, I am going to sue the government in the United States district court. And once it's adversarial litigation, there can be no doubt that the American Rule applies with its full force and effect over the last two centuries. Is there any language short of saying explicitly ""attorneys' fees"" that would overcome the American Rule? We're told there are no magic words, but what short of saying ""including attorneys' fees"" or ""and attorneys' fees"" would do? The answer to the question is no, that either the words attorneys' fees, counsel fees, reasonable compensation for services of a lawyer for a bankrupt estate, which was true in the Baker Botts case, there would be words that would be specific and explicit, to refer to Justice Kavanaugh's point, where Baker Botts, this Court made clear, that to have an exception because of a statute under the American Rule, it must be specific and explicit.
And well before that, in the Alyeska case, a decision by this Court was to the same effect as well as other decisions. Well, I presume that if the Congress wrote a provision that said the pro rata share of all the services of its personnel, that would be enough, because you wouldn't exclude lawyers from that? If Congress had a specific provision that showed it was intending to include lawyers, Congress has the authority to enact such legislation. But as in your exact example, I would say there would still be an ambiguity because of the American Rule.
And let me give you an example from history. Three years before the enactment of what we now call Section 145, there was a statute enacted by Congress with respect to the expenses of the Patent Office.
It was an appropriations statute. And Congress said we have five new positions.
We have the Commissioner of Patents, we have a chief examining clerk, we have another examining clerk, and we have two other clerks. And Congress said we need to pay for their salaries and said these are expenses of the office. Note: Three years later, when Section 145 was first enacted, the language was different in several respects.
The language is all the expenses of the proceeding as distinct from expenses of the Patent Office, which it was addressing three years -- But -- -- earlier. -- Mr. Chu, are you saying that expenses of the office is not enough to get you lawyers' fees? Suppose it was just expenses of the Patent Office, which would presumably give you the expenses, you know, the -- the -- the costs of personnel. Yes.
I -- Does that not -- does that not include lawyers? Yes, I am saying under this backdrop of the American Rule, this Court has made clear Congress needs to enact a statute that is specific and explicit. It basically has to say lawyers? Or words to that effect, yes. Well, what does words to that effect mean? Counsel, compensation for legal counsel, for advice, whatever.
In other words -- Fees? The word ""fees"" alone? I do not believe the word fees alone would cover it, because fees can refer to many, many other things, docket fees, marshal fees, filing fees, fees of other personnel, perhaps, but not attorneys' fees. If there is an ambiguity under the American Rule, this Court has repeatedly made clear it must be ""specific and explicit."" What -- what expenses in your view does Section 145 impose on the person who invokes that proceeding? Travel expenses, lodging expenses, parking expenses, expenses with respect to court reporters, printing expenses, marshal fees, docket fees, court interpreters. That's not an exhaustive list but it does not include attorneys' fees. Is it -- Are experts? I'm sorry. Experts? I do not think it should include expert witness fees, whether they are internal experts or external experts, but I want to note for the Court in this particular instance, for practical reasons, NantKwest did not challenge the government's request for expert witness fees and they were paid. Well, that's -- see, then you put your finger on, yes, the American Rule, yes, yes, yes, but you have a special kind of case.
And Congress was saying, it seemed, and says again, look, present all your evidence to the Patent Office.
And if you don't like the result, go to the Federal Circuit.
You want a second bite, you forgot to bring in somebody or you didn't, and then they'll have to bring in people, and before you know it, you have some big expense here, experts. And, sure enough, you're saying, no, don't cover those.
Not very discouraging, if they wanted to discourage you from using 145. I mean, did it carve out a separate special thing here or do we just use the American Rule? Yes. I know what you're going to say.
That's the trouble. (Laughter.) And I'm the one who's puzzled by it. If I -- if I look puzzled -- I would like -- You don't look puzzled. -- to withdraw my puzzled look. I'm the one who is puzzled by it. But I will say that in every case where a party wanted attorneys' fees under a statute, this Court has always applied the American Rule. Yeah, I know that's true. Either the general rule, each party bears their own attorneys' fees, or the part of the American Rule that says if there's a specific and explicit statutory exception, that can apply. And the government points to no exception.
The government points to no case decided by this Court involving a claim for fees under a statute that says the American Rule did not apply. Well, as you -- And which leaves -- I'm sorry. As you just said, in the typical American Rule case, the rule is each party to the case bears its own expenses, but that's not the situation here, is it? It's a question of whether you pay or other people who are not involved in this litigation at all pay. And maybe it is only going to be $1.60, but still other people are paying this expenses.
Doesn't that make that different from the American Rule? I would state the rule differently than Your Honor.
The American Rule doesn't apply to expenses generally.
The American Rule applies to a claim for attorneys' fees, period. Well, let me -- let me ask something that's related.
Maybe it's the same thing.
Just as a matter of fairness, why should these other people pay for the costs that you have caused the Patent Office to incur? If we were Congress -- and we're not -- Congress could decide what it thinks is fair or wise or good public policy. But as this Court has said in Alyeska, and Baker and Botts, no matter how good that policy might be, this Court does not have the roving authority to make those decisions.
It is up to Congress. Well - Could you -- Go ahead. Could you tell me what the difference is between expenses and cost? We have a whole statutory system of costs. Yes. I believe some of the items that you mentioned earlier as being expenses are not covered under the traditional sense.
Give me a definition of expenses.
It doesn't -- Yes. As you understand it. Yes.
Let me do this in two parts.
First in 1839, what did expenses mean? The Bouvier Legal Dictionary define ""expensae litis,"" which literally means expenses of litigation.
And it actually defined those expenses to be the costs that could be awarded to the prevailing party. To the same effect are two other legal definitions from legal dictionaries, both before and after 1839.
And, in fact, one of those was the first Black's Law Dictionary, which was in 1891. Now, the second part of the answer is today.
The meaning of ""costs"" has taken on a term of art in federal litigation.
And there are certain things that are considered to be costs and other things not to be costs, but, overall, I think any litigator today in federal court would say the word ""expenses"" floating by itself alone is probably a broader term than ""costs."" Is -- is -- this you might have looked up, and it -- it might help me actually and help you -- or not.
But -- but did you find any -- in any area where an agency, say, has proceeded along path one for 150 years, and then suddenly changes its mind and says now we're going to go on path two, and the court either said oh, well, that makes no difference whatsoever or the court said: No, it's too late, now we take into account the way you have carried this out? Did you find anything else -- We found no case -- Nothing on that? -- no case, no instance where an agency has done anything like that, even for considerably shorter periods of time. Or did you find some in a shorter period of time and the court said we're going to follow your habit; we're not going to follow going into a deep -- deep, difficult statutory analysis with an old statute? It's good enough for you; it's good enough for us.
Anything like that? Not for any period of time. I can give you an example, but it's a relatively short period of time. This case -- this Court decided the Adams Fruit case.
The Labor Department was dealing with a statute passed by Congress that gave workers, under certain circumstances, a private right of suit. And the Labor Department said: Aha, we have the ability to interpret that statute and we should get deference.
And it interpreted the statute to mean that the workers couldn't sue in federal court; they had to go through state law procedures. And the question that came up to this Court -- it was a Chevron question -- should this Court defer to the agency's interpretation of the statute? And this Court said no, this is a judicial matter.
This isn't a matter of an agency having its own discretion. So too here.
This is district court litigation where the parties are adversaries. The proceeding in the Patent Office is quite different from that.
The American Rule has always applied in federal court litigation. I'd like to point out -- Picking up on -- on Justice Breyer's question, if you have a situation where there's a statute and it's pretty evident -- and certain parties, here it would be the PTO, for some period of time do not advance an interpretation of the statute that would benefit them, and a period of time passes, should we adopt a rule that that's strong evidence of what the statute means, that it doesn't mean the thing that -- the interpretation that would have benefited these parties that failed to take advantage of it? I would say yes, in the following sense: The beginning part of statutory interpretation is always plain and ordinary meaning of the language on the date of enactment.
There can be other factors. But the over 170 years involve scores, maybe hundreds, of senior Patent Office officials.
Not a one of them thought that the plain and ordinary meaning of ""expenses"" in Section 145 or its predecessors included attorneys' fees.
So that should be considered by this Court. Now, I wanted to point out -- Just in ordinary English, though, ""expenses"" would encompass attorneys' fees, wouldn't it? That's Mr. Stewart's point to the contrary. It might or might not, but it would ignore the American Rule for 200 years, ignore the consistent case law of this Court always applying the American Rule, including applying the American Rule when in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, the unsuccessful petitioner, under that Act of Congress, could be awarded attorneys' fees. Although this Court didn't use the words ""American Rule,"" the government's reply brief, I believe at page 18, I would say takes the position in the reply brief different from earlier positions and says, in effect, this Court was applying the American Rule. Is -- is -- you -- you probably, I'm just looking at your resume here, have experience in this patent area.
Is that true? Yes. Okay.
And in your experience, where you're settling out of court or where you're -- you're trying to work out a system without going into court for resolving a claimant who says this is infringing my patent, or there are all kinds of people claiming it, you set up private systems, and the private systems, whether it's arbitration, mediation, thousands of different systems, involve costs, is it fairly common, not fairly common, unheard of, or what, to say in the contract that, it's doing this for future controversies, that you bring up the controversy, you pay the whole thing? Or maybe the opposite.
What's it like? I can think of no instance by my personal experience or through reading or otherwise where a contract would say you bring this up and you pay for the whole thing, no matter what, including attorneys' fees. But there certainly are agreements that are silent on attorneys' fees in recognition of the American Rule, or that expressly say attorneys' fees may be shifted under certain circumstances, or expressly say not at all. I would say what's interesting here is that Congress in 1952 first enacted what we now know as Section 285 of the Patent Act.
And that provides for an award of ""attorneys' fees"" -- using those words -- that may be awarded in exceptional cases. And at that same time, in the 1952 Act, Congress amended Section 145.
It used to be called R.S. 4915.
It got codified as 145. The prior 145 has the exact same language that the current 145 has, but it added a clause where the entire statute at the time was ""all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant, whether he shall prevail or not, prevail or otherwise,"" or words to that effect. So Congress, in adding this attorneys' fees provision for Section 285, where they use the word ""attorneys' fees,"" took out that last clause.
So it wasn't just carelessness, we're not worrying about the rest of the Patent Act. They were focused and focused in particular on 145. I want to point out also that the government argued that there is no other statute that would be affected.
We respectfully disagree.
The word ""expenses"" standing alone without a reference to attorneys' fees in an open-ended fashion appears elsewhere. Let me give you an example: 19 U.S.C. 1608.
19 U.S.C. 1608.
It relates to customs forfeitures.
So a party saying, Customs Department, you shouldn't have caused my property to be forfeited, I want it back, must pay ""all"" -- the word ""all"" appears -- ""all the costs and expenses."" It's pretty closely analogous to this statute here.
No party, no one, not the government or anyone else, not an academician has ever raised the question about ""all the expenses"" in that statute includes attorneys' fees. Here's another example: This is 19 U.S.C. 6337.
The IRS can levy on a taxpayer's property, if the taxes weren't paid.
So the private taxpayer says: I want my property back. And the statute provides: Taxpayer, you get your property back if you pay the expenses and the unpaid tax. I suppose a difference there is -- and maybe there is -- but I gather in those situations there weren't alternative proceedings that you could go through. I do not know before the statutes whether there were or were not alternative proceedings.
My main point is in those two examples, one that refers to all expenses and the other that refers to expenses, they are open-ended. Yeah, I -- I -- I don't want to preempt him, but I suspect Mr. Stewart will say don't worry about those, because those are different.
Here, you know, the -- the applicant has two different routes, and if he wants to take the route that imposes more -- excuse me -- more costs on the government, then he should be expected to pay for it. Well, that is their argument.
But that is rewriting the statute that Congress actually enacted in 1839.
Because it may sound sensible to the government today. In 1839 -- you've gone to a lot of work here, but in 1839, say 1840 to 1865, they did have a fund where the patentees paid all the expenses, et cetera.
And then they had this too for the 145 equivalent to 145. During that period of time, that period of time, did the government ever try to collect attorneys' fees as part of the expenses? No. No.
Okay. I thank the Court very much. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have six minutes remaining. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, there were -- there were various questions concerning the -- the legal significance of the PTO's, and formerly the Patent Office's, failure to take this position over an extended period of time. And there is no question this is an atmospherically unhelpful point for us, but I -- I -- (Laughter.) I -- I don't -- I don't think that it fits in any established doctrinal category, that -- that is, there are cases in which the Court has said when you have a body of court of appeals precedent that adopts a particular interpretation of a particular term, and then Congress reenacts the provision without changing that term, then Congress can be supposed to have acquiesced in or ratified the -- the prior judicial interpretation. We don't have anything like that here. We don't have a body of lower court case law saying that the term expenses doesn't include personnel expenses. You do have that interpretation through action by the agency itself over the period of 190 years or something. I mean, you could -- you could say at the most that a -- a view that these expenses were not recoverable is implicit in what the PTO has done or not done.
Even with respect to the PTO, it's not as though the agency ever promulgated a regulation or issued some similarly formal statement to the effect that we think expenses means the following things and it doesn't include -- But we do have a doctrine, the American Rule, that says that unless a clear statement of attorneys' fees is encompassed, we won't impose them.
So for 170 years the PTO didn't think of expenses, including attorneys' fees.
Very consistent with the American Rule. Okay.
The -- the two things I would say are it -- it might be that part of the PTO's motivation, we don't know, but it's a reasonable speculation, is that the PTO didn't seek these expenses in part because it wondered whether the term was sufficiently clear to overcome the American Rule.
But on close examination, we think that it is. That is, NantKwest has offered various examples of things that it would be covered -- thinks that it would be covered, things that it thinks wouldn't be covered, but it hasn't propounded a test.
It hasn't pointed the Court to a dictionary that would include some things and not the others. The other -- What about your -- I know this is slightly frivolous, but, I mean, we say we finally figured out what Justinian meant by this particular thing, a thousand years ago. Do you see the -- I -- I -- I see the point, but, you know, the Court -- the Court -- Can you share it with the rest of us? (Laughter.) The -- the -- the Court has said in cases like United States versus Fausto that the implications of existing statutory provisions may be clarified by newly-enacted provisions, and the PTO has examined this matter afresh in light of the totality of the statutory scheme. And the last thing I would want to say, and it's in -- in part a continuation of the point I was making earlier about the Section 145 suit being, in a very meaningful sense, in a legal sense, a continuation of the examination process. Up to this point, Congress has directed the PTO to ensure that its aggregate intake equals its aggregate expenses.
It hasn't directed the PTO to fine-tune the process to ensure that each patent applicant pays his or her fair share. But suppose it did.
Suppose Congress said each applicant shall pay all the expenses of the application and examination process.
If -- if the argument was made, that shouldn't include a pro rata share of the salary of the PTO examiner who worked on the case.
The Court would say that's crazy.
How could -- how could the PTO possibly effectuate its congressional mandate to collect aggregate expenses in a way that equals costs if it didn't -- if it didn't collect the single greatest expense that it incurs when a PTO examiner does his or her work? And, similarly, an appeal to the Board.
If each patent applicant was required to pay all the expenses of the Board proceeding, of course that would include an increment of money that was attributable to the time spent on the case by the Board judges, even though those judges are lawyers. No one would think that the American Rule required some clearer statement than that, that Congress intended the person who invoked that process to pay the extra expenses that the PTO incurs by virtue of that process. Similarly, the examiners on the patent side are typically not lawyers.
Trademark examiners are lawyers.
And the work that they do in examination is, therefore, lawyers' work. But nobody imagines that the American Rule has anything to do with the PTO's ability to make sure that people who invoke the examination services pay their fair share of the PTO's overall expenses. I think this goes back to a question that you got at the very beginning.
But setting attorneys' fees aside, could you tell us, Mr. Stewart, exactly what expenses you charge for and exactly what expenses you don't? I mean, sometimes we have charged for travel expenses.
We didn't in this case.
I don't believe we charged for printing costs, although I think we could have. With respect to personnel expenses specifically, we would charge for the lawyers. We would charge for the legal -- for the paralegals. In this case we had an outside expert who was -- was kind of paid money out of the agency's funds, and we did charge for that. There are other circumstances in which, rather than retain an outside expert, we get expertise from within the agency. So it could be the patent examiner who worked on the case or it could be somebody else, and we would charge a pro rata share of that person's time. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-107, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes versus the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Cole. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Aimee Stephens is a transgender woman. She was a valued employee of Harris Funeral Homes for six years, until she told her boss that she was going to live and identify as a woman. When Harris Homes responded by firing her, it discriminated against her because of her sex for three reasons: First, in firing her for failing to conform to its owner's explicitly stated stereotypes about how men and women should behave, it discriminated against her in the same way that Price Waterhouse discriminated against Ann Hopkins for failing to walk and talk more femininely.
It can't be that Ann Hopkins would lose her case on the same facts were she transgender. Second, Harris Homes fired her for identifying as a woman only because she was assigned a male sex at birth.
In doing so, it fired her for contravening a sex-specific expectation that applies only to people assigned male sex at birth; namely, that they live and identify as a man for their entire lives.
That is disparate treatment on the basis of sex. Third, Harris Homes fired her for, in its owner's words, changing her sex.
That's discrimination in the same way that firing someone for changing their religion would be religious discrimination. That Harris Homes would fire both transgender men for being insufficiently feminine and transgender women for being insufficiently masculine is, as the government concedes, two acts of sex discrimination, not a defense. None of these arguments ask this Court to redefine or, in Judge Posner's words, update sex.
They assume, arguendo, that sex means at a minimum sex assigned at birth based on visible anatomy or biological sex. I understand -- I understand that as the argument, and I -- I believe it's the same as in -- in the prior case.
But it -- does that argument hold up when you get to specific work requirements? In other words, if the objection of a transgender man transitioning to woman is that he should be allowed to use, he or she, should be allowed to use the women's bathroom, now, how do you analyze that? I understand how you analyze -- Yeah. -- status as it were, maybe that's hiring and firing on the basis -- treating it as just on the basis of sex, but when you get to specific policies, does that hold true? So, first of all, Your Honor, how one -- how you answer this case will not resolve how you answer that case.
Whether you rule against us or for us, the next case will arise in the -- in the following sense: A dress code that distinguishes on the basis of sex obviously is because of sex.
The question, then, is does it impose a discriminatory term and condition? And as this Court said in Burlington Northern, to discriminate is not just to differentiate, but to differentiate in a way that injures. Now I think you're -- I think you're missing my -- my point, maybe because it wasn't carefully expressed, but it's -- it's can the claim be -- I mean, I understand when you say you're dealing with transgender status and you can't discriminate on that basis with -- on the basis of status.
But when you get to the actual policy, do you analyze it as discrimination on the basis of sex carrying forward your reasoning from -- at the outset or on the basis of transgender status? So -- So if the objection of the transgender individual is that I want to use a bathroom consistent with my gender identity, rather than biological sex, do you analyze it as -- the affecting based on the transgender status or do you analyze it on the basis of biological sex? So the -- the -- I -- I think our argument rests on biological sex or what we think is more accurately referred to as sex assigned at birth. But here's -- here's the thing: If there is a -- this -- this case asks whether when someone fires someone because they're transgender or because they fail to conform to sex-based stereotypes, is that because of sex? That's what this case asks. Obviously, a sex-specific restroom policy is because of sex.
That -- so you're -- we're not answering that question.
It's because of sex.
Then the question is -- Right.
Now just if I could interrupt so I can follow. Yeah. It's because of sex. Because of biological sex -- And so -- but if you analyze it because of sex, then I think, as has been pointed out -- Yeah. -- there's no disadvantage, whether you're a man or a woman. But if you analyzed it on the basis of transgender status, there is, because you want to use the women's restroom and be biologically male. So when it's analyzed on the basis of sex, there's no problem, but when it's analyzed on the basis of transgender status, it presents a whole different case. So I don't think so, Your Honor.
I think -- look, anybody can challenge a sex-specific rule.
A transgender person can challenge a sex-specific rule.
A non-transgender person can challenge a sex-specific rule. What this Court said in Burlington Northern and in Oncale is that to decide whether something discriminates that refers to sex is you have to ask whether -- not just whether it differentiates, whether it differentiates in a way that injures. And you answer that question by asking would a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position experience a significant or trivial harm? Now and in most instances -- And that -- that's the question I posed to Ms. Karlan earlier. Right. And we went around the tree a bit, but ultimately came to, I believe, a submission that a reasonable person in the transgender Plaintiff's position would be harmed if he or she were fired for failing to follow the -- the bathroom rules or some sort of dress code that's not otherwise objectionable, along the lines of -- Yeah. -- that were present in the facts of this case, where men and women had rather traditional options available to them.
But -- so -- so is that your answer as well? That is -- that is my answer.
And here's why: Let's say we have a sex-specific dress code.
And you require me or you to follow the male dress code. Most instances, that's not going to be a significant harm.
That's a -- going to be a trivial harm, as the Court talked about in Burlington Northern.
Therefore, it's not discrimination, even though it differentiates on the basis of sex. But if you ask you or me to dress as a woman, we would consider that a significant harm.
And when you ask a transgender person to dress in a way that is contrary to their sense of gender identity, you have imposed a significant harm.
And the harm is because of sex -- Mr. Cole -- -- based on biological sex as Justice -- as Chief Justice Roberts argues. Mr. Cole, let's not avoid the difficult issue, okay? You have a transgender person who rightly is identifying as a woman and wants to use the women's bedroom, rightly, wrongly, not a moral choice, but this is what they identify with.
Their need is genuine.
I'm accepting all of that -- Yeah. -- and -- and they want to use the woman's bathroom.
But there are other women who are made uncomfortable, and not merely uncomfortable, but who would feel intruded upon if someone who still had male characteristics walked into their bathroom. That's why we have different bathrooms. So the hard question is how do we deal with that? That -- And -- and what in the law will guide judges in balancing those things? That's really what I think the question is about. Well, that is -- that is -- that is a question, Justice Sotomayor.
It is not the question in this case, because -- Mr. Cole, that's -- yes -- And -- and -- -- because the -- once we decide the case in your favor, then that question is inevitable. No, I think even if -- And it may not be-- -- you decide the case against us -- It may not be in -- if there's single-sex bathrooms, there might be one answer, meaning what harm would the other women -- reasonable woman feel if a man is using a single-sex bathroom, might be another if it is two locker rooms, men and women, girls and boys and who walks in is something you can't control. That's what the question is saying. But -- - but, Justice Sotomayor, the reason deciding this case will not decide that case is because -- It won't decide that case. It won't decide -- but even if you rule against us, that case can arise, because it is a sex-specific rule, and anyone who is affected by a sex-specific rule can argue that it discriminates against them because a reasonable person in their shoes would experience a significant harm. Well, I understood you -- I understood you to say -- maybe I didn't understand you correctly -- that if your client had been fired for using the woman's bathroom, that would be a violation of Title VII. So I -- what I said was, yes, that -- that -- in our view, were we litigating that case here, which we aren't, they admitted that the -- the restroom was a -- was a hypothetical issue and not a -- a reason why she was fired, but were we litigating that case, I think the question would be not whether the -- the policy was because of sex, which is the question here, because obviously the restroom is because of sex. The question would be, does imposing that restroom policy, which is obviously because of sex, impose a discriminatory injury on an individual. Yeah And -- And if you require me to go to the women's restroom, that's a serious -- So what you're -- -- issue. -- saying is, we're stuck with that question regardless of how we decide this case. Whether you rule for or against us.
This case -- Well, but the difference is that part of the argument, at least, is that the term ""sex"" includes sexual orientation. And -- and if that is the case, if we analyze the bathroom case purely on the basis of biological sex, maybe you have one answer.
But if you analyze it in terms of transgender status, you have a different answer, because men and women who identify with their biological sex aren't disadvantaged whether they use the men's room, you know, they each can use their own restroom. But the issue seems -- is quite different if you are dealing with a transgender individual who wants to use the restroom of their gender identity, contrary to their biological sex. And the question is, how do you analyze that? You say in each case it's on the basis of sex.
Do you analyze it on the basis of biological sex or are you analyzing it on the -- a different basis, because they present different issues? I -- Your Honor, for this -- for purposes of this case, all we are arguing is that Title -- Title VII's reference to sex at least includes what you're calling biological sex, what we call sex assigned -- Mr. Cole -- -- at birth -- You can go further than that.
For purposes of the next case, all it includes -- Yes, exactly. -- is biological sex as well.
All that you're saying is, yes, that -- because of sex means because of biological sex, regardless of whether the transgendered person or whether a non-transgendered person brings this claim about the restroom. But you're -- Okay so then it's -- then it's an easy case, right? Yes. Because if it's just biological sex, there's no problem because there is no disadvantage. But if you're looking at transgender status, there is a huge problem because it is not biological discrimination -- No. -- or the claim is going to be different.
Certainly a transgender individual can bring the claim under Title VII that it discriminates on the basis of sex. Right. But if the claim is it discriminates against me because I am a transgender individual, that's not your claim? But that's not -- the -- the -- the claim here is that you are treating -- that Harris Homes is treating Aimee Stephens differently because of her sex assigned at birth.
If she had a female sex assigned at birth, she would not be fired.
Because she had a male sex assigned at birth, she is fired. That is discrimination because of sex. That's all that -- What if they -- And that doesn't decide the bathroom question because the bathroom question -- there's no doubt that a -- a separate sex bathrooms are because of sex. Because of biological sex. Because of biological sex, as you use it.
It is -- because the question then is, does it impose a de minimis burden, a trivial burden, as the Court said in Burlington Northern, or does it impose a significant burden. In Burlington Northern, the Court said the same rule can impose a significant burden as to some people and a trivial burden as to others.
A schedule change might be trivial for a -- a -- a -- a worker with no kids -- But I imagine -- -- but a worker with kids it would be significant. I -- I imagine you would say that excluding a transgender woman from the woman's bathroom would be far more than a de minimis burden on that person, but let me move -- move out of that. Exactly. Let me move beyond the bathroom to another example.
And it's not before us, but it will be coming.
So a transgender woman is not permitted to compete on a woman's college sports team.
Is that discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX? So Title IX is a different statute with regulations that explicitly permit sex-segregated teams when competitive skill or -- or contact sports are involved.
So, again -- But this is not -- this is a question of someone who has transitioned from male to female -- Right. -- and wants to play on the female team.
She's not questioning separate female/male teams.
But she was born a man.
She has transitioned.
She wants to play on the female team. Does it violate Title IX which prohibits gender-based discrimination? Right.
And I think the question again would not be affected even by the way that the Court decides this case, because the question would be: Is it permissible to have sex-segregated teams? Yes, where they involve competitive skill or -- or contact sports.
And then the question would be: How do you apply that permissible sex segregation to a transgender individual? And it may be that because Title IX recognizes concerns about competitive skill in contact sports, that it's permissible.
It may be that it's not permissible.
But this -- this case just asks, when you fire somebody because you say she -- he was going to represent himself as a man, because she was using the name Aimee and that's not permissible because he's a man, is that sex discrimination? Yes, that is sex discrimination. Whether -- when you have a -- a -- a -- a policy that permits sex segregation, how that applies to transgender people is just a different question.
It is not answered one way or the other by this case. You would still have to ask, is it fair to keep that person off of the team just like it's fair to keep a -- a -- a -- a man off of that team? The -- the -- the -- the -- the stereotypes in this case are every bit as strong as they were in Price Waterhouse.
What Mr. -- in fact, they're stronger because in Price Waterhouse, you had to infer from statements that non-decision-makers were making about why Ann Hopkins was fired. Here, Mr. Rost has made his sex stereotypes absolutely clear and the government and Petitioner concede that transgender people are not excluded from the statute.
It's not like the German police officer. They concede, transgender people can bring sex discrimination claims.
She has brought a sex discrimination claim because she was fired for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, explicitly stated by her employer. That can't be.
Again, Ann Hopkins would lose her case were she transgender.
It's -- it's not okay to employ sex stereotypes against an employee until that employee becomes transgender. And at the end of the day, the objection to someone for being transgender is the ultimate sex stereotype.
It is saying, I object to you because you fail to conform to this stereotype: The stereotype that if you are assigned a male sex at birth, you must live and identify for your entire life as a man.
That is a true generalization for most of us, but it is not true for 1.5 million transgender Americans. And so to say we're going to fire you because you fail to -- to accord to a generalization about how people who are assigned a particular sex based on visible anatomy at birth have to live their lives for the rest of their lives is sex discrimination. It's also sex discrimination because she was clearly treated differently because of her sex assigned at birth.
Imagine an employer who had six Aimees and invited all six Aimees in and he said: You know, I just want to know what your sex assigned at birth was. And five of them say, well, I was assigned female at birth.
And one says, I was assigned male at birth.
And then he fires the one who says I was assigned male at birth. Obviously, that person is fired because of her sex assigned at birth. And as we saw from the prior argument, it need not be the only justification.
It needn't be only one justification. And -- and -- and -- and the notion that somehow discriminating against someone because they are transgender is not discrimination, discriminating against them because of their sex I think falls apart because to say I'm discriminating against you because you are transgender is to say I am treating you differently from other people who have the same gender identity, because of your sex assigned at birth. So, again, we're not asking that you update the statute.
We're not asking that you redefine sex.
We are accepting the narrowest -- for purposes of this case, the narrowest definition of sex and -- and arguing that you can't understand what Harris Homes did here without it -- it treating her differently because of her sex assigned at birth. There -- there seems, Mr. Cole, to be this dispute among the parties in this case as to what the basis of the firing was, whether the basis of the firing was the -- the violation of the dress code, particularly, or whether it was broader than that, was being transgender. What -- what should we make of that dispute? Well, I think, I mean, the Sixth Circuit expressly said that the reasons for firing her extended beyond the dress code. Counsel for Harris Homes conceded at oral argument in the Second Circuit that she would have been fired if she showed up as a woman, even if she were following the dress code.
And that's in Petitioner's Appendix 66A from the Sixth Circuit decision. And he fired her after he got the letter saying I am coming out as a woman, and I'm going to heretofore be called Aimee, without any discussion of the dress code whatsoever. So this -- So -- so -- -- is a case -- So, Mr. Cole, though, your argument, though, doesn't turn on that.
I mean, it -- as I understand it, again, that if -- if the firing had been solely what the employer claims, the basis of the dress code only, the result would be the same. And I guess I -- I'd just like you to have a chance to respond to Judge Lynch in his thoughtful dissent in which he lamented everything you have before us, but suggested that something as drastic a change in this country as bathrooms in every place of employment and dress codes in every place of employment that are otherwise gender neutral would be changed, that that -- that that's an essentially legislative decision. Your Honor -- Judge Lynch is a very thoughtful judge and -- and wrote a very thoughtful opinion that I -- I think he probably regretted having to write.
What do you say to -- to him? I -- I say that recognizing that transgender people have a right to exist in the workplace and not be turned away because of who they are does not end dress codes or restrooms. There are transgender lawyers in this courtroom today. Of -- of course, there are. And the -- That's not the question, Mr. Cole. And the -- no, but the -- this is -- Mr. Cole, the question is a matter of the judicial role and modesty in interpreting statutes that are old. And that's the question he posed. Right. Nobody is questioning, and he certainly did not, the legitimacy of the claims and the importance of them. So -- so I think that two -- The question is a matter of judicial interpretation. Yeah.
There's two -- If you wish to address it. Two -- two -- two answers to that, Your Honor.
First, on the question of judicial interpretation, we are not asking you to apply any meaning of sex other than the one that everybody agrees on as of 1964, which is sex assigned at birth or, as -- as they put it, biological sex.
We're not asking you to rewrite it. Second -- I agree with that. Second -- The question, though, again, and I'm sorry to pose it -- Yeah. -- but I'm going to give you one more shot. Yeah. Right? When a case is really close, really close, on the textual evidence, and I -- assume for the moment I'm -- Yeah. -- I'm with you on the textual evidence.
It's close, okay? We're not talking about extra-textual stuff.
We're -- we're talking about the text.
It's close.
The judge finds it very close. At the end of the day, should he or she take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision, and the possibility that -- that Congress didn't think about it -- So -- -- and that -- that is more effective -- more appropriate a legislative rather than a judicial function? That's it.
It's a question of judicial modesty. So, first of all, federal courts of appeals have been recognizing that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination for 20 years.
There's been no upheaval. As I was saying, there are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men's room and the -- the -- the -- the Court's dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen.
So the notion that somehow this is going to be a huge upheaval, we haven't seen that upheaval for 20 years, there's no reason you -- you would see that upheaval.
Transgender people follow the rule that's associated with their gender identity.
It's not disruptive. And as to whether this is a question of interpretation, it is absolutely a question of interpretation.
How in the world can the Court interpret Title VII to say that Ann Hopkins can't be fired for being insufficiently feminine, but my client can be fired for being insufficiently masculine? There's no textual basis for drawing that distinction whatsoever.
And that's because our argument rests on text meaning, at a minimum, sex assigned at birth or biological sex, and everybody agrees -- Did you want to address Judge Lynch's arguments or not? I -- I thought I was. Number 1, it won't -- it's not disruptive that transgender people exist in this world and we still have sex-segregated dress codes.
And, Number 2, it's not asking you to address a policy question that would be more appropriate to Congress but asking you to interpret the statute as it is written and as everybody agrees it applies to sex assigned at birth. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Treating women and men equally does not mean employers have to treat men as women. That is because sex and transgender status are independent concepts. Now, in the context of this case, Title VII gives Tom Rost the ability to consider how enforcement of a sex-specific dress code would impact all his employees and grieving clients.
But the Sixth Circuit imposed a new restriction, and its holding destroys all sex-specific policies and even BFOQs while undermining the protections that Title VII provides. If you accept at face value Stephens' concession that sex means biological males and females, then the funeral home wins.
So my friend, Mr. Cole, redefines sex to include transgender status in two respects. First, my friend's but-for test would mean that a women's overnight shelter must hire a man who identifies as a woman to serve as a counsellor to women who have been raped, trafficked, and abused and also share restroom, shower, and locker room facilities with them. That is because, but for the man's sex, he would be allowed to -- to hold that job and to use those facilities. The purportedly simple test does not get to the ultimate inquiry of whether men are being treated less favorably than similarly situated women because of sex.
That does not reflect the original public and legal meaning of a statute promoting women's equality. Second, under my friend's stereotyping logic, it is always illegal stereotyping to apply sex-specific policies based on biological sex.
And that's why he's wrong to say this case isn't about showers and overnight facilities and sports.
Every single one of those is impacted if you're talking about a sex-specific policy. What Title VII says is that sex-based differentiation is not the same as sex discrimination.
And that's why Ms. Karlan agreed that this Court's sex-specific dress policy doesn't violate Title VII.
And though Congress has added classifications to cover transgender status in other statutes, it has rejected more than a dozen proposals here. Title VII -- The first part, you've made the argument which I call the parade of horribles argument, but you've heard, as I have for the last hour and a half, the response, which is that isn't this case, that many of the things that you are worried about would be taken care of by bona fide occupational qualification, that other of those things would be taken care of by the need to show harm, as well as to show difference, and that there could be, though we haven't done it, and I'm not advocating it, yes or no, the possibility of bringing into such cases comparative harms.
And all those things are open. And if you say that the lower court decided them, this is not the lower court.
I take it that we are deciding simply whether it falls within the words ""sex discrimination"" and, if it does, we are not saying that there hasn't been harm, whether there has been a BFOQ, whether there is comparative harm, et cetera. That's what I've heard.
Now, what do you say to that? Justice Breyer, that is incorrect, because when a biological male is refused access to the women's restroom, the -- the male would say that was an injury. Yes, of course, he -- That they were hurt. -- he would say it's an injury. And there is no BFOQ. And the other side would say: I'm sorry but there's serious injuries on the other side.
And, therefore, it is a BFOQ.
Okay? And so this is not that case.
We do not have to decide it.
And I don't see why or how you can assume the answer and then build your argument on an answer that I certainly haven't given. It's their answer, and here's why: If Stephens is right that you cannot apply a sex-specific policy to those who identify as the opposite sex, then you cannot apply that policy to anyone because that itself would be sex discrimination. All right. It would be -- And just on the off chance that I feel we do not have to decide that matter in this case -- (Laughter.) -- have you other arguments that would favor your side? I know you do, and I'd just at some point to hear them. Certainly.
Their comparator is a man violating the dress code with a woman who follows the dress code.
That is wrong.
Our comparator is a man who violates the dress code with a woman who violates the dress code. Now, the reason we know theirs is wrong because if you were claiming transgender status discrimination, rather than sex discrimination, you would compare a transgender and a non-transgender employee, which is exactly what they do, which proves that they are adding a different classification into the statute that Congress has not added. And what they say is the reason we know you're wrong -- I'm not saying this -- nor am I assuming any other person thinks this, I'm just saying that this is what I hear -- that if you are right, then miscegenation does not fall within this statute, that Jews marrying Catholics does not fall within this statute, that any instance where people say or many instances where they say I fired this man because he wasn't a woman -- I fired the woman because it's a man's job, it's okay, as long as sometimes you'd fire a -- a -- a man because it's a woman's job.
You see the point. I do.
Justice Breyer. Okay.
Now the -- what is your answer to that? There is no non-racist reason why you would fire the employee in the interracial marriage.
There is no non-religious -- There isn't? I happen to know people.
I won't say who they are, but there are people -- (Laughter.) -- in my life I have heard say being Jewish is fine, being Catholic is fine, just don't get married. But that's a religious reason.
Now in this case -- Right.
I mean, does that mean it falls outside the statute that -- that -- that -- that forbids discrimination because of religion? Yes.
Because Title VII allows you to recognize that there are differences between women and men.
And that an employer -- switching back to the first case -- could terminate a same-sex couple or an employee who is married to a same-sex partner maybe because they are Catholic, and they believe that marriage is only between one man and one woman, and sex doesn't have anything to do with it. Let me give you an example here. That's a ministerial exception that already -- No. -- exists. A ministerial exception if the employer is a church, but not if the employer is a Christian businessman -- But there's still -- -- like Mr. Rost. But there's still religious exceptions that the Court has read into a lot of statutes.
Putting that aside, your example, very powerful, woman in -- women in a shelter who you say, if we accept his argument, will have to be guarded by or counseled by a transgendered woman, but isn't that exactly like Dothard? And there we said you can have -- you can't have sex-specific guarding of prisoners, unless you have a BFOQ. And there they found that it was a BFOQ to make only men guard men and women only guard women.
So I'm not quite sure that I understand your parade of horribles. Because under Mr. Cole's theory, BFOQs have to go too.
So that you have a BFOQ that says -- But it's statutory. It -- it is -- They can't -- they can't -- wish it away. If I could explain? But go ahead. If you have a BFOQ that says only a man can apply for this position, he would say that a woman who is transgender is a man, and, therefore, is eligible for that position, and no BFOQ in the world would be able to keep them out of that position. The problem is they're adding transgender classification to a statute where Congress has never added it. No.
What they're doing is saying if there is an independent reason why a man who's transgendered can't have a job that a woman has, then that reason is good enough, you don't have to hire them. But if there is no reason why your gender should marry in the work you're doing, why should you not be hired? Let -- let's go -- That's a very different -- No. -- proposition. But let's go back to the women's overnight shelter.
Assume for a moment that the employer had a BFOQ that only women counselors would be able to counsel and stay overnight with the women who have been abused. How does that fit with BFOQ? BFOQ is a very narrow category. I -- I agree.
But they're applying it broadly and I am using Justice Sotomayor's example.
Assume that there is a BFOQ for that and that someone would allow that. Their position is that it's stereotyping not to treat the man who identifies as a woman as a woman.
They are arguing that but for the fact that they were born as a man, they could take that women's position, so there is no BFOQ, there is no religious requirement that would stop and draw the line at the argument that they are making. All of the distinctions between men and women are gone forever.
And that's the plain text of the statute. Do you wish to -- But in -- -- address Judge Flaum's argument joined by Judge Ripple which, again is -- is a very thoughtful position too that there may be dual causes here, but the fact that sex is under consideration even as narrowly construed is enough to draw us within the statute? I think that line drawing inquiries happen all the time in Title VII.
And it is entirely appropriate for a judge to instruct the finder of fact to draw that line. And the line that has to be drawn based on Title VII's language is whether women are being treated less favorably than similarly situated men because of sex.
And sometimes it'll fall on the line; sometimes it won't. Consider -- I think, Mr. Bursch, that that's not quite right, women should be treated less differently than men.
You're making Title VII into a statute about groups but Title VII is not a statute about groups. That -- that's helpful, but I'm also curious what you have to say, Mr. Bursch. Yeah, let's put both of those together, individual and that concept. Say that you have a woman who identifies as a man and they're working at an employer and they get pregnant.
They would be entitled to the same pregnancy benefits as any of the women at -- at work because that -- if they didn't get it, that would be sexist. But if the employer applied a sex-specific dress code or sex-specific showers and restrooms, that would not be a statutory violation because of their biological differences.
Men and women are not similarly situated, and they're -- no one is being treated disadvantageously compared to someone else. So you could have an employee who might have a sex discrimination claim but they can't bring a claim because of their transgender status.
You might have someone who doesn't. Those are the things that we let juries work out.
And there's nothing unusual about that in the context of Title VII. I -- I -- I think, Mr. Bursch, maybe you answered Justice Gorsuch's question now.
You didn't answer mine. Okay. Title VII is a -- is a -- is a statute about individuals -- Correct. -- and whether individuals are being treated differently because of his or her sex.
It's not a statute about, well, in the aggregate, does this -- does this act disadvantage men versus women or women versus men? It's a statute that uses the word ""individual"" twice and says is a particular person being treated differently because of her sex? And here, Ms. Stephens, was being treated differently because of her sex.
And this was Judge Flaum's point in -- in that opinion, is that it's as simple as looking at the language of the statute, applying it to a particular individual, which Title VII insists that you do, and coming up with the obvious answer. Yes, if she had not been a -- if she had not been assigned at birth the sex that she was assigned at birth, she would have been treated differently. We agree with the individual treatment.
That's why in Oncale, this Court said basically in the context of a male-only work force that the plaintiff had a cause of action because he was being treated differently than a woman in his position would have been. A hypothetical comparator, to get back to some of Justice Ginsburg's questions, even if there are no women on the site, you still have that hypothetical comparator. Here it's individual too, but all the employer does in enforcing a sex-specific dress code applied neutrally to everyone, recognizes that there's differences between men and women. And if you say that Tom Ross can't do that, then there is no -- Are you pinning your answer on the fact of a dress code? Would your answer be the same if there were no dress code and Ms. Stephens had just been fired for being transgender? Because all your arguments in your brief -- I mean, you keep talking in your brief, as you do here, about the dress code, but the arguments that you make are arguments that would allow the employer to fire Ms. Stephens for being transgender, irrespective of whether there was a dress code. Here's the reason why, Justice Kagan. The why what? The -- that the arguments do go that far. Well, that the arguments apply in both situations. Yeah, if there's a dress code or if there's not a dress code? Because if this Court allows a sex-specific dress code because it acknowledges the differences between men and women, it's no different if an employer without a dress code impact -- imposes the same policy on an informal basis.
It doesn't change the fact that women are not being treated worse than men, as Ms. Karlan said. It doesn't treat her worse than -- or it doesn't treat men worse than women that we wear a tie in this courtroom and that women do not.
Sex-specific policies acknowledge that there are differences, so whether the sex code or the sex-specific dress code is in place or not, employers have that latitude. Now, some jurisdictions, like the District of Columbia, have taken that latitude that Title VII gives away from employers.
It says that you cannot, for example, treat someone differently based on their personal appearance, but otherwise when it comes to dress codes, grooming codes, opposite sex facilities, and all those types of things everyone would have understood Title VII at the time of its enactment as -- as those things being equal treatment and not disfavoring either sex over the other, whether on a group basis or an individual basis.
It doesn't make any difference. The -- the problem here is that under their theory, the -- the federal agency that brought this claim and -- and then an unelected panel in the Sixth Circuit, changed the law. They added a transgendered classification, applied it to a business retroactively.
And what's more, the Sixth Circuit said that sex itself is a stereotype. And Mr. Cole agrees with that 100 percent.
Everything that he said this morning, sex itself is a stereotype.
You can never treat a man who identifies as a woman differently because to do that is sex discrimination.
When you do that, there is no sex discrimination standard under Title VII anymore.
It's been completely blown up. One other point on the restroom scenario.
Gender identity is a broad concept. You could have a male employee who identifies as a woman but doesn't dress as a woman, looks like a man, showing up in the shower and the locker room, and, again, the employer wouldn't be able to do anything about that because under Mr. Cole's theory, but for the fact he was a man, he could be there.
And it's stereotyping to say men cannot be in the women's bathroom. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make three basic points aimed at basically addressing Justice Gorsuch's comment that this was -- this is a close textual case.
And I would like to respectfully argue that I don't think it's that close for three reasons. Oh, neither side ever thinks a case is close. (Laughter.) Judges always do, don't they? And the first, Your Honor, is the one that I was talking about earlier, that sex and gender identity, like sex and sexual orientation, are different traits. They're defined, they have different definitions, as my friend just said.
He agrees that they're different traits.
And there's a reason why when Congress wants to prohibit discrimination based on the traits of sexual orientation and gender identity, it lists them separately.
It doesn't define sex as including these traits.
It's because Congress has recognized there are different traits.
So as long as you treat men and women with the same different trait exactly the same regardless of their sex, you're not discriminating against them because of their sex. The second and related textual issue is that the standard for determining whether or not you're discriminating against somebody because he's a man or because she's a woman is that you're treating that person differently than a similarly situated person of the opposite sex and taking an adverse employment action against them as a result. So the threshold question is always are the two people that you're comparing actually similarly situated? Now, my friends on the other side assert that a transgender man is, in fact, similarly situated to a cisgender man, just like they assert that a gay woman is similarly situated to a straight man. But that is manifestly not true because, with respect to the transgender issue, the difference between a transgender man and a cisgender man is that one identifies with his biological sex and the other identifies with the opposite of his biological sex.
And that is a very meaningful difference that is not grounded on stereotypes.
It's simply grounded on a difference between a transgender man and a cisgender man. Likewise with sexual orientation.
The difference between a gay man and a straight woman is that -- is their sexual orientation. And that has nothing to do with stereotypes.
It has nothing to do with one -- whether one is better or worse than the other. A great deal of -- It's a different type of relationship. A great deal of -- of the arguments here could be cast as stereotypes, though, right? That the plaintiff in this case or that case doesn't conform to male or female stereotypes? That is -- And -- and as I understand your brief, you accept that argument and that those are good claims without respect to comparators of opposite sex.
And if -- if that's the case, what's the real difference here between the two sides? I mean, we've -- Right. I -- I accept there's some delta, but it seems smaller than might first appear. Sure.
And I -- what I would say the difference is at what stage of the analysis you're doing it? The way -- the place that stereotypes come up are when you're figuring out whether similarly situated -- whether two people are, in fact, similarly situated.
An aggressive man -- take Price Waterhouse: An aggressive man is similarly situated to an aggressive woman.
They have the exact same trait, aggressiveness, and the only difference is that stereotypical view that women shouldn't be aggressive. But a transgender man and a cisgender man do not ever share the same trait in the first place because one identifies with his biological sex, the other identifies with the opposite of his biological sex.
And that is simply a different trait that is not grounded in any kind of stereotype.
And a gay man is not similarly situated -- General -- -- to a straight woman for exactly the same reason. I mean I think one could argue just the opposite, that there is another trait in Price Waterhouse, and the trait is conformity to traditional gender roles. So your argument would suggest, no, we shouldn't look at the aggressive woman and the aggressive man.
We should instead say, no, there's this other thing, which is conformity to gender roles. Right. We should really look at whether the employer treats the same the aggressive woman and the docile man, the docile effeminate man.
And if the employer treats the aggressive woman in the same way that the employer treats the effeminate man, they're both fired, then the employer is off the hook. Now, you yourself, say that that's not right, that, in fact -- Right. -- that's double discrimination and the employer is on the hook twice.
But it seems to me that the exact same analysis applies because there is this independent trait, which is just a little bit different from the independent trait here.
Here the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the independent trait, so-called, that you say is the transgender identity.
There, the independent trait was the refusal to conform to traditional gender roles. Right.
And -- and I -- the reason I disagree with that analysis, Your Honor, is because I don't think that Price Waterhouse creates some kind of freestanding stereotype claim. What it prohibits is stereotypes that show that you're treating similarly situated men and women differently. But I thought you -- So in Price Waterhouse -- I thought you answered the question that -- that Price Waterhouse would not have prevailed if it had treated men who were not sufficiently macho in the same way that they treated women who were not sufficiently feminine. No, Your Honor, I believe we said the opposite of that in our brief.
And it was -- That that would be okay? Yeah, we said the opposite of that in our brief. Then I could ask this -- And they could rely on the -- for both cases -- Yes. -- they could rely on the stereotype that the woman doesn't fit, they can rely on the stereotype that the man didn't fit, although the cases have said that the object of Title VII was to get at the entire spectrum of sex stereotypes. And so as we read Price Waterhouse, which I have no quarrel with in the slightest, if you treat an aggressive woman worse than an aggressive man, you are violating Title VII because you're treating similarly situated people differently. Applying that here, if you treat a transgender man exactly the same as you treat a transgender woman regardless of their sex, you're likewise not discriminating against them because of their sex -- I -- I -- -- since they're similarly situated -- I -- we got that.
I -- I -- I want to know on a totally separate argument. Yeah. See, one, it's only my characterization, not anybody else's, but I do characterize one set of arguments that you've been through as trying to work with the language of the statute.
All right? And on the one hand, you have these are individuals, individuals four times -- Yeah. -- and on the other hand, you have -- and the arguments that were made here and, on the other hand, arguments on the other side.
I'm putting that to the side. Okay. Then there are the horribles.
Okay? And we've discussed that at length.
I'm putting that to the side. Okay. Then I say, well, there seems to be a third set in some of these briefs, that regardless of the first two, Congress -- and that's what I think the dissenting judge was talking about, and Judge Posner, who had a good point.
I'm not saying it's a winning point -- (Laughter.) -- which is what I want to know. Yeah. That Congress wouldn't have dreamt of this when it passed the statute.
All right? I heard you say, I think, we're not relying on that.
Is that so? The government is not relying on that? No, we are relying on it in this sense. Oh, you are. One -- one, we think it fortifies our other arguments, but I know -- Of course, it does. -- you don't -- I know you don't want me to push on that, so I'm not going to push on that.
We're relying on it to the sense that to the extent there is any ambiguity here, we think it is strongly dispelled by the history of these statutes. And I want to address that updating issue because it's a very important question. Yes. And here, by updating it in the way that my friends on the other side would have you update it, they're actually undermining the manner in which Congress has traditionally considered updating it. If you look at ENDA, which I think -- ENDA. -- refers to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, for nearly a decade now, when Congress has looked and considered expanding the scope of the liability provisions, it has acknowledged that there are religious liberty issues at stake.
And it wants to be able to take those into account too. If you look at the states, they've often come to very similar compromises where they found peace amongst otherwise very -- Got it. -- groups of very different views. But if you resolve this issue judicially, you are essentially delivering -- and I hate to use these types of terms -- All right. -- but a complete victory to one side of the fight and nothing to the other side -- All right.
I've got that point. -- of the fight, you're upsetting that -- Yeah. -- legislative balance. Look I -- I think that is an argument in your favor. Yeah. Moreover, I think this whole category is the elephant in the room and -- That -- that was actually the -- -- I think it is -- -- third point point I was going to make to Justice Gorsuch. Well, all right, I think it is.
But then on the other side of what you're saying is the following, which is abstract but no more so. In the '60s, we were only ten years away from where people who were real slaves and -- and discriminated against obtained a degree of freedom.
And these statutes were all part of a civil rights movement that was designed to give, include in our society, people who had been truly discriminated against for the worst of reasons. And at that time, this civil rights statute, when it was passed, would have put in the category gay people, transgender people, of people who were suffering terrible discrimination.
And over time, this Court has moved away from that view finding it unconstitutional. And now, doesn't that fact, which is an overwhelming fact to me about the nature of the country under law, argue that that's a change.
That's a change that both explains why they didn't put it in initially and explains why we should, other things being equal, interpret it to include gay people and transgender people now? No, Your Honor, for a couple of reasons, I would argue against that.
And, again, I'm going to put the text to the one side, but, though I do think that that is our strongest argument. I -- I -- I -- I actually find it troubling for courts to take that approach because I actually think it deprives the people of the ability to struggle with these issues democratically. And I think it is very important when we have these kinds of big changes, that we actually convince one another that this is the right thing to do. No one ever -- And when courts -- No one ever thought sexual harassment was encompassed by discrimination on the basis of sex back in '64. It wasn't until a book was written in the middle '70s bringing that out. And now we say, of course, harassing someone, subjecting her to terms and conditions of employment she would not encounter if she were a male, that is sex discrimination but it wasn't recognized -- And -- -- to be such in the beginning. And, Your Honor, I think that that is a straightforward application of Title VII's text. With respect to what I was talking about with Justice Breyer where we were putting the text aside, I think it is important to allow the democratic processes to resolve these issues so we have a stable resolution of the issue and one that takes into account what everybody would agree are legitimate interests on all sides. In Obergefell, this Court made very clear that there were good and decent people who had different views with respect to gay marriage and they should be respected. The legislative process is the process that allows those views to respect -- be respected as well as the very powerful views of my friends on the other side -- May I -- General Francisco -- -- which also should be respected. May -- may I just ask, at what point does a court continue to permit invidious discrimination against groups that, where we have a difference of opinion, we believe the language of the statute is clear. I think Justice Breyer was right that Title VII, the Civil Rights Act, all of our acts were born from the desire to ensure that we treated people equally and not on the basis of invidious reasons. And we can't deny that homosexuals are being fired merely for being who they are and not because of religious reasons, not because they are performing their jobs poorly, not because they can't do whatever is required of a position, but merely because they're a suspect class to some people.
They may have power in some regions, but they're still being beaten, they are still being ostracized from certain things. At what point does a court say, Congress spoke about this, the original Congress who wrote this statute told us what they meant. They used clear words.
And regardless of what others may have thought over time, it's very clear that what's happening fits those words. At what point do we say we have to step in? I guess my answer, Your Honor, would be at the point when Congress actually addresses the issue.
And the main argument that we are making and have been making from beginning to end is that Congress has not resolved this issue because sex/gender identity, sex/sexual orientation -- General, these are some -- -- are different traits. -- some thoughtful responses that you have given to this set of questions. But in responding to Justice Breyer, you said, if we thought that there was a clear application of the statute.
So I would just ask you, if you thought that this was a clear application of the statute in the same way that sexual harassment was a clear application of the statute, even though nobody recognized it at the time, if you thought that this was a clear application of the statute, would we have to come out against you? Yes, Your Honor, if the statute is unambiguously against me, you have to rule against me.
I actually think that the statute is unambiguously in my favor for the reasons I was given and the third reason, which is the reason that Justice Breyer alluded to, Justice Scalia's great line about how we don't hide elephants in mouse holes. Everybody here agrees that Congress never thought that by prohibiting discrimination based on sex, they would also be prohibiting discrimination based on two very different traits, sexual orientation and gender identity. My friends would have this Court essentially reach that same result indirectly. I think all of the textual arguments cut in our favor straight away, but to the extent there is any doubt, there is no way to find that elephant in this mouse hole. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Cole. Thank you. Interpreting a statute is not depriving the democratic process.
It is doing what the Court is supposed to do within the democratic process, and of course if the democratic process disagrees with the Court's interpretation of the statute, it can change it. So there's no deprivation of the democratic process here. Secondly, the purpose of Title VII as this Court defined it was to make sex irrelevant to people's ability to succeed at work, to make sex irrelevant to people's ability to succeed at work. When Harris Homes fired Aimee Stephens because it learned about her sex assigned at birth being different from her gender identity, it did not make sex irrelevant to her ability to succeed at work.
It made it determinative. Think about it this way.
If Harris Homes fired a man because he was a man that would be sex discrimination.
If it fired an employee because he was insufficiently masculine, that would clearly be sex discrimination. In this case, Harris Homes fired Aimee Stephens because he thought she is a man who is insufficiently masculine.
That too must be sex discrimination. She's not seeking any special protection.
She is seeking and all transgender people are seeking the same protection that everybody else gets under the law.
This Court 30 years ago said in Price Waterhouse: ""We are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by insisting that they match the stereotypes associated with their group."" We are certainly beyond that day today as well, and what Harris Homes did was to insist that she match the stereotypes associated with her group.
That's impermissible under this Court's precedence, that's impermissible under the literal terms of the statute and this Court should rule for Aimee Stephens. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.

"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-5924, Ramos versus Louisiana. Mr. Fisher. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Last term in Timbs against Indiana, this Court reaffirmed the well-settled rule that incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights apply the same way to the states as they apply to the federal government. Taking that rule as the given, the state does not defend Justice Powell's pivotal vote in the Apodaca case.
And, indeed, that reasoning flouted precedent at the time and has since been relegated to nothing more than an isolated relic of an abandoned doctrine. The state's only defense in -- in support of the judgment below is that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity at all; that is, not in state courts or in federal courts. This Court should reject that argument.
As the Court has said many times over many decades, the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict to convict.
In particular, what the Court has said is that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury carries with it the essentials of the common law. And the common law authorities are uniform, explicit, and absolute.
Unanimity is an absolute requirement to trial by jury.
And the reasons that the common law commentators gave for that rule are the -- are -- resonate just as powerfully now as they did then.
In a nutshell, we are not prepared to take away someone's liberty unless a cross-section of the community uniformly agrees that criminal punishment is appropriate. Now, I don't think the state disputes that historical account that I just gave you or even that unanimity is central to the proper functioning of the jury trial right.
Instead, what the state says are two primary things: First, that the drafting history of the Sixth Amendment suggests that the framers meant to dispense with that historical rule, and, second, that that historical requirement of unanimity is no more important than the 12-person rule, which this Court said is not part of the Sixth Amendment, in Williams. So let me turn to those two arguments. Let me start with the drafting history.
And we think for three reasons the state has over-read the drafting history. First, as the Court itself said in cases dealing with provisions like the Second Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause, we do not read into a deletion of language any meaning when there's no contemporary evidence that it was designed to change the meaning of the provision. And that's all the more true here because of the contextual backdrop.
The state talks about the fact that many states at the time had trial by jury provisions in their own constitutions and correctly notes that some of those provisions explicitly required unanimity but some of them didn't. And the rule was the same across all of those states, so the thing that the framers would have taken from the context at the time would have been that it doesn't matter whether you have unanimity in the provision; it requires it either way. Well, but still that -- And I think -- I mean, to give them -- to be fair, even if you see some have unanimity, some don't, and you've got a draft that says unanimity, I don't understand why you would take it out and just then be able to argue later, well, it doesn't matter whether it was in or not.
It's in there in the draft; why would they take it out? Well, the best historical evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, is that it was -- it got latched onto a debate about the vicinage requirement.
And so what James Madison did is take away all of the elaboration of the -- of the right to trial by jury. And so I think actually the best example also to respond is -- is -- is the Pennsylvania Constitution, which at the time of the founding required unanimity explicitly.
And then Justice Wilson actually amended the -- rewrote the constitution in -- in Pennsylvania to take it out.
And, remember, Justice Wilson, as we note at length in our brief, was one of the leading expositors of the common law notion of trial by jury and the Sixth Amendment requiring unanimity. And I think that was the last thing I wanted to say about the drafting history, is that one would think that if the framers had dispensed with 400 years of uniform practice, that somebody would have said something about it.
But what you have is the reverse.
You have Justice Wilson, right after the Constitution's founding, talking at great length about how unanimity is ""indispensable."" You have Justice Story in his Commentaries using exactly the same word, ""indispensable."" And you have any number of other criminal law treatises at the time, all of which are gathered in our brief and at greater length in the ACLU brief that canvasses the history, all reinforcing this notion. You are asking us to overrule Apodaca, so we do have to think about stare decisis.
And last term, the majority was lectured pretty sternly in a couple of dissents about the importance of stare decisis and about the impropriety of overruling established rules. I'm thinking about the dissent in Franchise Tax Board and the dissent in Knick versus Township of Scott. And a very important consideration in considering stare decisis is reliance.
So it would be helpful to me if you could compare the reliance that's at issue here.
Louisiana and Oregon have tried thousands of cases, in reliance on Apodaca.
The Court said: This was okay.
We've never -- we've never suggested that it wasn't.
We've denied cert in lots of cases. So can you compare the reliance here with the reliance in Franchise Tax Board and in Knick? Well, I think Justice Alito, I'd like to make both a legal comparison and a factual comparison. So starting with the law, I think it's important to note that the state here is -- is claiming to rely on Apodaca, but they are not defending the rule of Apodaca, which is that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't require states to have unanimous verdicts.
Instead, they're asking the Court to adopt a new rule of Sixth Amendment law that the Court has never adopted. And I know the Court last term, as you -- as you note, in part of those disagreements, some justices were saying, well, it's okay to come up and rehabilitate an old rule; that shouldn't forgo stare decisis value. Well, but that's -- But here the state is asking for a brand-new rule. I -- I don't want to interrupt.
That's a fair point, but we're not tied in deciding this case to the position that's taken by the state.
We have a decision of this Court, Apodaca, and we could -- we could affirm it on -- on a different ground from the one that the -- the exact one the state has -- has advanced. But I want you to complete what you were saying. Yeah, so let me give you three reasons why, even if you take that as a -- as a given, stare decisis shouldn't carry the day.
And then I'll turn to the facts. But still sticking with the law, three things: One is remember Justice Powell's vote was an isolated vote where there was no majority for the Court, and it was -- indeed, his vote was rejected by the other -- So could I ask you -- -- eight justices on the Court. This is so unfair, Mr. Fisher, but could I ask you to take that out of your analysis and just pretend for the remainder of your analysis, I -- I think that's an important consideration, which I'm not quite sure how to think about, but if you assume that this was, you know, just any old 5-4 decision. So I would then move to my second point, which would be that the -- the -- that Fourteenth Amendment rule, even if it had been adopted by a majority, is a derelict in the law.
It is isolated -- it is really an abandoned relic of past jurisprudence.
And you don't have to look further than last term in Timbs.
You can look at the McDonald opinion and you can look at any number of other -- Well -- -- opinions from this Court that say the same standards have to apply to the states as the federal government. I mean, it would be an outlier.
It would be something that says, look, we just -- we have an exception here.
We -- we are going to treat this amendment differently. But you know we tolerate a pretty significant degree of diversity in state criminal procedure, and this could just be one of those sorts of rules, where -- where we say you -- you know, there are occasional times where we think that the state gets to decide something on its own.
And so, yeah, it's anomaly.
Usually, we do look in stare decisis reasoning for anomalies, but this is not the kind of anomaly that should concern us overmuch because, in general, criminal procedure law is loaded with anomalies. Well, Justice Kagan, I think -- let me respond one thing I hope isn't fighting the premise, but what I would say is if the -- if you look at the Court's incorporation jurisprudence, that is the one place the Court has not accepted anomalies and where the Court has said that stare decisis is at a very low ebb when it comes to states following the fundamental rules of the road of the Bill of Rights.
So I think on that level, it is a different kind of a situation than the ordinary stare decisis case. Did Timbs recognize that exception? Pardon me? Timbs, in saying the Excessive Fines Clause applies to the states, recognize Apodaca as an exception? Recognized the Sixth Amendment was the one exception to complete incorporation? That's right, Justice Ginsburg.
And I think my argument today is that even though that's been an exception for several years, it shouldn't go forward. It doesn't have any footing in the law.
There's no -- What else have you got? -- Fourteenth Amendment footing.
So let me turn to the -- to I think back to Justice Alito's question, because I think you were asking about convictions. And I think this is another area where stare decisis actually has less to say than normal.
And that's because the Court already has a developed set of doctrines, like the Teague jurisprudence and the Griffith jurisprudence that are themselves designed to give states reliance interest in their past and past precedent from this Court. So unlike the ordinary case, Franchise Tax Board and any number of other doctrines, you have this whole separate set of doctrines that the state can invoke to support its reliance interest -- Well, we don't know -- -- in those past convictions. -- how a decision in your favor in this case would play out in collateral review, either in federal court or in state court. But do you think -- I mean, I -- I can well envision seeing you up here in a term or two arguing this is a water -- the rule that you are trying to persuade us to accept today is a watershed rule of criminal procedure. Do you think that's a -- a frivolous argument? I don't think it's frivolous, Justice Alito.
I think the best thing the state will have to say for itself in that respect is that Duncan itself, when the Court incorporated the right to jury trial, Duncan itself was not held to be retroactive in the DeStefano opinion, and in Schiro against Summerlin the Court reaffirmed that precedent. But, Justice Alito, the core point that I'm making to you today is, in deciding whether to overrule a past case, absolutely reliance interests are at stake. But there are separate doctrines to protect those reliance interests, so that I don't think you should give them undue weight in this situation.
And I don't think the Court has given those kinds of things undue weight in the past.
And I would direct the Court back to its McDonald decision where it catalogued all the times over the years in the Court's incorporation jurisprudence that it has overruled past cases. And I don't think there is any other area of law in the Court's jurisprudence where stare decisis over the years has held less value than -- What about -- -- incorporation. Sorry. No, go ahead. What about the size of the jury, if we were to accept your argument here, how or could we draw a distinction between this case and the precedence on size of a jury? Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I think Williams itself tells you how you would do that.
It says that the question under the Sixth Amendment is whether the feature at issue is an indispensable feature or, as the Court also put it, an essential feature of the right to jury trial as we practice it in this country. And what the Court concluded in Williams after looking at historical sources was they were mixed.
And probably the better reading of those sources were the 12-person rule was just a historical accident. And so that is a holding of this Court that puts it on the other side of the ledger from the uniform common law authorities when it comes to unanimity and that holding, moreover, Justice Kavanaugh, would be entitled to a stare decisis effect. Do you think -- What -- what -- -- we would have to -- Sorry. Mr. Fisher, Williams, I think, is a problem for you.
If only six minds need to agree to convict of a criminal offense, why shouldn't ten be enough? Justice Ginsburg, the key principle is not how many.
It's the degree of agreement.
And so my -- my core proposition to you today is that a 10-2 verdict is less guaranteed to be accurate and less guaranteed to be consonant with the purposes of jury trial than a 6-0 verdict.
And I think -- And that's -- -- maybe it would help -- You prefaced that by saying that's a key part of the distinction you are trying to draw? Well, I -- maybe it is the very distinction. Well, I know. But, I mean, I guess I'm not sure that's self-apparent.
I mean, I don't know whether you play it out in game theory or something, but if you asked the defendant, what do you want? Do you want six, and they have to agree across the board, or do you want 12, and you have got to convince -- that's not immediately apparent to me which -- which I would take. Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can I give you a legal answer and a practical answer? So as a legal answer, the -- the unanimity required even of a six-person verdict is more consistent with -- and, in fact, is the only consistent outcome -- with the purposes of the jury trial clause because the core purposes are effective deliberation towards an accurate decision and a cross-section of the community. Now, remember what happens in Louisiana and in Oregon is that a cross-section of the community, somewhat by design, can be left out of and canceled out of those deliberations.
And that's very different than a 6/0 verdict when it comes to the way things happen in the jury room and the public confidence in that verdict. And I'll also give you a practical answer to your question.
When Louisiana was considering changing its law, and, indeed, did change its law, which I would say parenthetically is also something that I think should be taken into account when it comes to stare decisis, that Louisiana has even changed its law, but during those deliberations there was a prosecutor who testified before the legislature and said that he used to sometimes charge felonies instead of misdemeanors because it was easier to get a 10-2 verdict than it was to get a 6-0 verdict. Mr. Fisher, let's say I am not entirely persuaded by your functionalist arguments about the distinction between unanimity and numbers between this case and Williams. Have you got anything else besides these functionalist arguments about the real great importance about unanimity and the relative lack of importance about numbers? I think what I would say to you, Justice Gorsuch, is the text of the Sixth Amendment understood through its purpose distinguishes this case from Williams.
And so let me explain what I mean by that. The text of the Sixth Amendment says the defendant has a right to trial by jury.
And so the key is what does that phrase mean? And from history we know that that phrase meant that not just that the defendant got a jury, but that the trial by jury included the way the jury reached its decision. In fact, if we -- if we have a jury who hangs or can't reach a verdict, there's a mistrial.
So we don't even have trial by jury. So that's inherent in the term. I think what the Court said in Williams is that of course there are going to be some features of the common law.
Imagine, for example, that the justice -- that the jurors all had to wear a particular color jacket to -- to courtroom.
There is going to be certain incidental features of the right to jury trial that don't necessarily have to be read along with the Sixth Amendment. There would be certain things that happened to occur at common law that wouldn't necessarily be brought forward today. Now, I think maybe what you're -- you're driving at to some degree is I think there is an argument and there was a powerful argument made in Williams that 12 -- that the 12-person requirement shouldn't be thought of that way.
There were some people who thought the 12-person requirement was also a very important feature. But, of course, there were others who didn't.
Lord Coke, which the Court quoted, and many other commentators thought, well, no, 12 people is just a fanciful number.
It's inherently arbitrary.
It doesn't really mean anything.
And so all we're getting at in this case I think are what's the core meaning of the phrase -- phrase trial by jury. If the -- Do you think, Mr. Fisher, that we would also have to overrule Ludwig versus Massachusetts if we overruled Apodaca? If I understand it right, that was another case in which Justice Powell's unusual approach to incorporation ended up being the deciding vote in the case.
It was about a two-tiered jury system. That's right, Justice Kagan.
I think that all my position here today would tell you, if you were to revisit that, is that -- is that Justice Powell's vote in that case, just like in this case, doesn't set up a rule of law the Court should adhere to.
But you would still have a separate Sixth Amendment question in Ludwig which the Court -- I'm sorry -- which the Court divided on and you'd -- you would consider that case on its own terms. And to be perfectly candid with you, I don't even know what the common law would say about the two-tiered jury system.
That was not something the Court considered in that case and it would be a whole different set of arguments. You -- Do you -- You -- you started off and then I told you to stop, but I thought I'd give you an opportunity to do it again. I mean, what are we to make of this 4-1-4 reasoning of Apodaca and -- and -- and what do you think the rule should be about stare decisis going forward? Do you need a majority? Do you just need a controlling rule? What's -- what's the right way to think about that? Well, I can tell you what I think and I can tell you what the Court has done.
I think that there are times where a single vote could be accorded stare decisis effect, particularly if it's comfortably a narrower ground within the Marks rule. But then you have other cases more like this where Marks doesn't so easily fit onto that system.
And I think that the most recent time the Court dealt with a situation like that was the Hughes case a couple terms ago, where you had a 4-1-4 vote in the prior case and what the Court said is we're going to consider this issue fresh. The Court did the same thing in Seminole Tribe.
And -- and Seminole Tribe is a good example of a case that drew deep divisions within the Court as to what the substantive meaning of the Eleventh Amendment was.
But Justice Souter in his dissent said I do not begrudge the majority for considering this issue fresh, because there was no majority of the Court that had proper -- that had previously spoken to it and our votes were all over the map. Well, what about a party that has to make decisions about how it's going to order its affairs in the wake of a decision that it wins but does it in a 4-1-4 decision? What are they -- what is that party supposed to do? Say, well, all right, we won this case, but we really can't rely on it because we don't know what -- because it has no stare decisis effect, and then what happens as the years go by and nothing happens, the Court doesn't come back to that question? Well, Justice Alito, I think that at least in the ordinary case, the -- the -- the party would have every -- every right to rely on this Court's decision, subject to the ordinary principles of stare decisis that we're deciding. I think the one thing that makes this case unusual is you would think that if the party did rely on that prior case they'd at least come up and defend it instead of ask the Court for a different rule. And I think that just tells you something about how -- how discredited the fifth vote in this -- in this case is, which I think makes it almost a universe of one.
I can't think of -- I -- I've looked and I haven't found any other case where somebody has gone to -- come up to this Court and said: I'm not even going to make an argument based on the provision of the Constitution on which the previous decision rests.
That -- Can I come back to the -- the math question that was alluded to earlier? I am not myself, I must confess, capable of doing this math, but somebody could. So if you hypothesize a jury pool with a certain percentage of jurors who were inclined to acquit, and you ask is there a greater likelihood of acquittal with a 6-0 verdict than a 10-2 verdict or an 11-1 verdict or if the state decides to have a jury that's bigger than 12, a 15-1 -- a 15-person injury, 14-1; 19-1, when we get to the point where the chance of acquittal is -- is in favor of the non-unanimous rule, would that be unconstitutional? My rule is that any time the state deviates from unanimity, it is unconstitutional, so even if a state were to go beyond the number of 12.
And I think the reason why is because it's a different phenomenon when somebody disagrees in the jury room. And I don't mean to be presumptuous, but I've heard some justices of this Court remark there's a difference between a 9-0 opinion and an 8-1 opinion.
When somebody puts reasonable, good-faith views on the table and requires an answer from the others, it sharpens ones thinking, it leads to better results sometimes -- I mean, you really -- -- and at least in a jury room, that would be case. You really want to argue that? So if a -- if a petit jury had to be as big as a grand jury and you were representing a criminal defendant, you would rather -- you would say we want -- 6-0 is better for us than 21 to 1? Justice Alito, perhaps there'd be a number where that argument would start to be difficult, and I think that -- that what I would tell you is the history and tradition of this country makes it highly unlikely that we're ever going to see a system like that. What we have uniformly, almost, throughout the states is a ceiling of 12.
And I think -- you talked about a math problem.
And I think maybe it's also helpful to remind the Court of the Court's term -- decision last term in Flowers, where the Court talked about the math of preemptory challenges. And I think you have a similar math problem here, which is if you have one or two members of a minority on a jury, it could be a racial minority, it could be a political minority, it could be a religious minority, are we really prepared to say that those one or two votes can be utterly canceled out? Do the racial origins of this rule have an impact on how we think about stare decisis in this case? I think they do, Justice Kavanaugh.
I think -- How? How do -- how should we factor those in? I think in a couple ways. I think, when you talk about how reasonable the reliance is from the state, I think it's perhaps justifiable to look at the origins of the law that it's defending. But I also think more directly, if you're asking whether Justice Powell's Fourteenth Amendment reasoning should stand, he didn't even consider this history.
I'm not sure it was put in front of the Court.
And as the Court has said many other times like in McDonald, like in Pena-Rodriguez, when we're reading provisions of the Bill of Rights against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, the history and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment is a salient way to -- You really -- -- think that. -- want to make that argument? You made a big deal of it in your brief. I thought you'd -- I thought you would abandon it here today.
But if -- if another state were to enact the same statute that Louisiana has tomorrow and did it for all of the legitimate policy reasons that have led such entities as the American Bar Association and the American Law Institute and lots of reputable scholars and the framers of the Constitution of Puerto Rico and the people who made the rule in the United Kingdom, all of which allow non-unanimous juries, if they -- if that was enacted for that reason, that might be constitutional, but this statute is not constitutional and the Oregon statute is not constitutional because of the -- the origin that you a attribute to them? No, Justice -- Justice Alito.
Let me make sure that I am clear with the Court. We think that purpose perhaps could inform the Court's decision-making, and particularly if you're looking at stare decisis, it could inform whether to stick with an old Fourteenth Amendment rule, but we don't think it's essential to our Sixth Amendment argument. And we think if a state had followed the old ALI recommendation before the Sixth Amendment was incorporated in the states, that I'd be making all -- all the other same arguments I'm making here today. But I think the thing I would leave you with, before I sit down for rebuttal, is that it is telling, Justice Alito, I think, that no state has ever done that.
The only two states that have ever deviated did -- did so under circumstances where the cross-section of the community that the jury trial was designed to bring into the courtroom had changed.
And part of the design was to leave a part of that cross-section, perhaps, out of deliberations. You -- you mentioned a couple of times earlier in your argument where the Court has said that a decision is entitled to less stare decisis effect because the parties have come into Court and tried to kind of improve the reasoning, so the Court has said, of the earlier decision. And as I understood what you were saying, you were saying that this even goes beyond that. Right. Could -- could you explain why or is it the same as that or -- because I've never liked that argument.
So is this just -- is -- is -- is your argument just the same thing? No.
I think it's a step further, Justice Kagan.
I think even if you believe that parties ought to be entitled, especially when there's many years between an old decision and a new one, to -- to make -- defend the old decision with the rhythms and the precedents and the ideas that have intervened -- so, for example, to take a case like Citizens United, perhaps the government could have come in in that case and made other First Amendment arguments in support of that statute in that case. I think we have here something entirely different, though.
The state is not even making a Fourteenth Amendment argument. They're asking the Court to adopt a rule -- and let me just be clear, the rule that they're asking the Court to adopt is the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimous verdict.
Five justices in Apodaca squarely rejected that argument.
And the Court, itself, in 14th -- 14 other opinions have rejected that argument. It was unsettled -- So, Justice Kagan, I think this is different in kind. It was unsettled until Apodaca.
Unanimity question was not settled until Apodaca, right? Well, because four -- four of the justices there thought unanimity was not required; four thought it was. My -- So it was Apodaca, the fifth vote being Powell's vote, that said -- set the precedent for you to require a unanimity in federal trials. Let me say something about before Apodaca and then after, Justice Ginsburg.
Before Apodaca, the Court had squarely held in Andres in the 1940s that the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict. And it had said it many other times, but I think in that case, it was integral to the holding. And so what I understood the four-justice plurality to be saying in Apodaca was doing what Justice White had said in a footnote in Duncan it could do, which is reconsider the old precedents. But even if I didn't have that, I would have the five votes in Apodaca, Justice Ginsburg, and the statements in cases like Richard and Descamps later, where the Court has cited Justice Powell's opinion as the law and said that it settles the Sixth Amendment question. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Murrill. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with Petitioner that this case presents two issues: whether the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity and, if so, whether that requirement applies to the states. The Court should decide this case on the first issue because nothing in the text, structure, or history of the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts. Nor has this Court ever held that the framers wholesale adopted the common law.
In fact, the Court has expressly rejected that view in Hurtado with regard to the Bill of Rights and in Williams.
Those correct holdings, plus historical evidence that the framers expressly rejected unanimity and the Sixth Amendment, are fatal to Petitioner's request to add back words that the Senate rejected in 1789. The reliance interests here are overwhelming.
Because the Sixth Amendment is not a code of criminal procedure, over two centuries of states -- two -- for two centuries, states have adapted their criminal justice systems to their particular circumstances, and Louisiana for the last 50 years has specifically relied on this Court's express approval of the system that's challenged here today again. We have 32,000 people that are currently serving time for serious crimes.
And each of these convictions would be subject to challenge if Apodaca is reversed.
Overruling Apodaca strikes -- would strike at the foundation of widespread state practices that include indictment by information and juries of fewer than 12. The beauty of our system, is that people can change the rules.
So if they now want to require unanimity, they can do so.
They can amend their state laws, as Louisiana recently did, or they can amend the federal Constitution. The judgment in Apodaca should be affirmed.
And I'm happy to take questions. Are you asking the Court to take up a question that five justices answered in Apodaca? That is, that the Sixth -- Apodaca, five -- there were five votes to say that the Sixth Amendment requires jury unanimity in federal trials. You are asking to -- us to reject a rule that five justices adhered to. Justice Ginsburg, we don't think that Justice Powell's decision was entirely clear with regard to the rule as it would apply historically.
We think the text is very, very clear that unanimity was -- is -- is not there and that it was rejected. So -- But -- -- we're happy -- -- there were -- there were four justices who said unanimity was required.
And then there was Justice Powell, who said unanimity is required in federal trials.
You are asking us to overturn that position, that unanimity is required in federal trials? Justice Ginsburg, we don't believe that that was central to his holding or to his position in his plurality opinion.
And -- and our position would be that one justice's opinion that is not central to his -- his plurality opinion plus four dissenters does not -- is not equal to a holding. Then aren't we -- aren't we in -- having to address this fresh, just as you really seem to want us to do? I mean, that -- that -- that seems to me an admission that we are in a proper place to -- to take this up afresh. If precedent weighs for anything, what do we do with Andres? What do we do with those 14 cases throughout Supreme Court history that seem to treat unanimity as part of the Sixth Amendment? And what do we do as well with Hughes and with Seminole Tribe and a lot of other cases where we have been facing similarly splintered decisions and the Court has come back and addressed the question fresh without considering stare decisis in those cases? Sometimes the -- the Court can't reach majority opinion.
Sometimes it's just unable to.
And why doesn't a state take that risk when it relies on a decision that is so splintered? Justice Gorsuch, I think that Louisiana reasonably relied on a decision of this Court that it -- that non-unanimous juries were constitutional.
They also did that on the tail end of a decision by this Court in Williams that found that a six-man jury was also constitutional. Well, we're not dealing with a -- And -- and I don't -- -- a six-person jury, so we can put that aside.
We're -- we're dealing with unanimity.
And I -- I don't think you're arguing that the Court did anything improper in Hughes or did anything improper in Seminole Tribe by taking up the question afresh. And I'm just curious why it would be different here and why the state shouldn't be assigned some degree of risk, assuming risk, by proceeding in this area on the reliance of one -- one member of the Court's opinion that is rather, I think fair to say, idiosyncratic? Well, for one thing, I think that incorporation doctrine evolved over time.
So I'm not sure that the state was -- it was -- it was reasonable to expect the state to ignore an actual holding in a case and anticipate that that would change over time. So that's -- that's one response that I have to that question. My second response is that I think you can take it up afresh.
But -- but I also -- this is a non-textual -- I appreciate -- I appreciate that.
That's helpful. Yeah. Well, just on that, General Murrill, so, I mean, you don't really want us to take that up afresh, do you? I mean, aren't you -- I'm sort of confused because there is the sentence in your brief that says neither party is asking the Court to accord Justice Powell's solo opinion in Apodaca precedential force. Is that right, that you're not asking us to accord Justice Powell's solo opinion precedential force? Because if that's right, then -- I mean, are you basically just saying to me: Forget Justice Powell's opinion in Apodaca; just decide what the Sixth Amendment requires? Justice Kagan, I -- I think that given the evolution of incorporation theory, we find ourselves in a position where it is even more important to get the text right and to get the history right. So if -- if -- if that means taking that issue up afresh -- But, you see -- -- then we should do that. -- I think I agree with Justice Alito.
You have some strong reliance interests here, but -- but your reliance interests are only relevant in the context of an argument from stare decisis. And I guess I would like to know then how are your reliance interests relevant? What argument from stare decisis are you making? Well, we think that the text and the history do not include a non-unanimous jury verdict.
We think that that's a constitutional -- that is a choice that states can make. That's not -- And so, you know, that's -- we think that the -- the four Justices, plus Justice Powell's decision, were a ruling that said that it was not unconstitutional to have non-unanimous jury verdicts and it was reasonable for us to rely on that. So we don't -- we don't entirely disavow stare decisis.
I mean, we still believe we have enormous reliance interests. You were relying on Justice Powell's opinion in Apodaca.
That's the only -- We're also relying -- For stare decisis that must be what you're relying on, combined with the other four that said the states don't have to provide unanimous juries. Well, I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that we're also relying on this Court's opinions in -- in Williams and in Hurtado that said that the Court -- that has never adopted the common law wholesale. I mean, that's -- But you -- you -- -- that is I think critical to the analysis. Just to be clear, you are not urging the Apodaca.
You want us to go back and say what the Sixth Amendment requires, the -- the issue on which the Court was divided, you want us to say unanimity is not required in federal trials and it's not required in state trials, and on that issue, what is your view of the Seventh Amendment? Does the Seventh Amendment require unanimity in civil trials? Justice Ginsburg, I think the Seventh Amendment is a different question.
Its text is different.
Its structure -- But just -- just the -- -- is different. -- the answer to my question: Is unanimity required under the Seventh Amendment in civil trials in federal court? I don't believe that it would be required in the Seventh Amendment but I don't think you need to determine that here today. Well -- That's not the issue. Well, this Court has held -- The issue is the Sixth Amendment. -- that it -- there's a -- there's a holding of the Supreme Court that's over 100 years old so holding.
And so no reliance interests for anybody there? Justice Gorsuch, my answer is specifically related to the text and what the text would require.
I'm not disputing that there might be precedent that would apply -- Oh, okay. -- in the Seventh Amendment. All right. I just -- All right.
So we don't count precedent in the Seventh Amendment but we do in this area on Justice Powell's opinion. Let's say the Seventh Amendment does require a jury trial.
In what universe does it make sense to imagine that the framers of the Constitution would have insisted on a jury trial for civil cases where property is at stake but not in criminal cases where liberty is at stake, and lives? I -- I believe that the structure and the history of both reach -- ultimately on the textual answer reach the same result.
I -- I -- I don't think that they would. All right.
You disagree with the Supreme Court's analysis on the Seventh Amendment.
I understand that. But spot for me a moment that the Supreme Court might have gotten the Seventh Amendment right.
Okay? It may be possible. All right? In -- in what universe would the rule be different for criminal cases? I -- I -- I don't think necessarily the rule would be different.
I think that the -- that we have to look at what the text and the history demand, and that when we are talking about a non-textual right, I think that it is very, very important that the Court get the history right. And the history tells us that this -- that unanimity was rejected for a reason, that there were -- there was a very specific decision that was made to reject unanimity.
It was proposed, it was rejected, it was debated, it was discussed, it was a known issue, because four states had -- How far -- -- actually adopted non-unanimity. How far are you willing to depart from unanimity? Would a 7-5 requirement be okay under your theory? Mr. Chief Justice, I think this Court has established some of the outer boundaries already in Williams and in Burch and in Will -- and in Apodaca.
So nine, under Apodaca, 9-3 is okay. I would -- I would also remind the Court that Louisiana in reliance on this Court's decision in Apodaca and in Johnson went and at a constitutional convention the year after this -- that case was decided, discussed it, expressly relied on it, and increased voting rules to 10-2. Can we go back to reliance a moment? Putting aside that in Janus a couple of decisions from the Supreme Court put the unions on notice that things should -- that the constitutional theory was on shaky ground, and here you have a series of cases, much older, telling you that the incorporation theory was on shaky ground. But you're talking about a parade of horribles if we rule against you.
How about the parade of horribles if we rule in your favor? How do we decide what's at the essence of the common law jury trial? Would issues like having a fair cross-section of the community and the veneer be in question? We have a case that says that's incorporated.
Or what about what we said in Sullivan, that the Sixth Amendment jury right requires a jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt? None of those terms are in the Constitution.
None of those terms, as far as I know, were part of the discussions at the convention.
Are they going to be open to attack now, too, if we rule in your favor? There's no history, there's no anything, except our sense of what the essence of the common law right was. And -- Not our sense, but the history of what happened and why. So I think, Justice Sotomayor, that we have the text and what made the cut after the debates over what was missing. But the debates -- So -- -- we have a bunch of people who were in favor of the cuts telling everybody else everybody understands that a unanimous verdict is the standard. So we have part of the constitutional debate.
Hamilton himself, who drafted it and took out the right to a unanimous jury, basically said during the -- the discussion it's so self-evident, we don't need to include it. So you're looking at -- But -- -- history just in terms of what was taken out, but without the context of the discussion. Not exclusively, Justice Sotomayor.
I think we also would agree that due process and -- and equal protection play a role. I mean, we -- we don't have requirements anymore that it's only 12 white male freeholders. Exactly. So, you know, I think that's an example of how we did not adopt the common law in all of its -- its -- its historical terms.
We actually -- Congress adopted some of that language over time.
It was not embedded in the Constitution. So we -- we know that there was an historical debate.
We know that states had adopted a different rule, and -- and then some of them wrote this rule into their own state constitution.
So known debated problem. There's a -- there -- Madison proposes an amendment, thinks he solved this problem, and then it gets rejected by the Senate.
So -- But it -- but why was it rejected? I mean, one -- one account is it was totally unnecessary.
Everybody understood a jury trial meant unanimous agreement. So we took it out because we didn't want to clutter up the Constitution with unnecessary statements.
The words ""jury trial"" themselves mean unanimous verdict. Well, Justice Ginsburg, we did clutter it up with an impartial -- with the word ""impartial."" And we did clutter it up with a number of other terms. And -- and I don't -- and I think that the history showing that states felt that it was important to write it into some of their constitutions indicates that there certainly was at least a view that -- that it should be written in by some and not -- so I don't think it's a fair reading to -- to assume that that was simply because we would all know that it would be there, especially because they knew that they were writing a document for the future. For the sake of argument, assume that I think the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous jury.
Just for the sake of argument.
What are your best arguments, then, for why the right is not incorporated, and relatedly your best arguments for not overruling Apodaca, which is read, the -- the opposing counsel says, to have allowed the states to do that? Justice Kavanaugh, they are concededly not very good.
I mean, I -- I think that based on Timbs, that we recognize that this Court, at least at this point in time, has taken a view of incorporation that says that there's no daylight.
So if you find that unanimity is required, I find myself in a far more difficult position -- Well, yes -- What about -- -- and no -- -- to make that argument. Yes and no, General Murrill, because you have this stare decisis, except you're giving it away.
And I don't know what to make of that -- I -- -- because I would think what you would do is to say something like: This is an outlier in our incorporation doctrine.
There's no question that it is.
But it has been an on outlier for 50 years.
It has been completely administrable.
It has been completely clear.
States have had every right to rely on this for 50 years.
It doesn't matter whether it was wrong because overruling something requires more than just the decision be wrong.
It has been there.
States have relied on it.
There's no reason to change it. The end.
Stare decisis. But you're telling me that Justice Powell's opinion isn't entitled to precedential force, isn't entitled to stare decisis effect. So I don't know what to do with that argument anymore. Justice Kagan, I agree with everything that you said about the reasons why this Court should affirm Apodaca and that it should be given stare decisis effect. I -- I think that we are struggling with the fact that Justice Powell's decision doesn't seem to be the view of the Court and -- and that it -- the text and the history also, I -- I strongly and firmly believe, are on our side. Well, you're not the only state who has an interest here.
And, in fact, there's only one state going forward as of this moment that has an interest in this, and that's Oregon.
And Oregon might change its rule or it might not change its rule. But Oregon filed a brief and Oregon doesn't make the arguments you're making. Oregon says it should be made clear what this brief does not do.
It does not address the merits of whether Apodaca was correctly decided. I -- and I think that Oregon finds itself in a position where the democratic process has stalled in anticipation of this decision.
So they've -- they've written a brief that expressly, I think, emphasizes all of our reliance interests.
Puerto Rico has similar reliance interests.
There's a long line of cases that dealt with territorials and the right -- and the Constitution's application to territories.
They have similar interests too. So we -- we do think that the reliance interests are very, very important. I mean, it's true -- We believe that the judgment was correct. It is certainly true that we, in recent years, have rejected the two-track idea about incorporation, but the opposite isn't a crazy argument.
As recently as McDonald, there were some voices on this Court that it was -- were essentially making that argument with respect to the Second Amendment. And earlier, there were -- it's a very respectable argument.
It hasn't won the light -- it -- it hasn't won the day completely, but that's what Apodaca rests on. Well, Justice Alito, if you're telling me that there is a little bit of daylight, then I'll take it.
I mean, I -- I think that, you know, we -- but I also believe the history -- that -- that the history shows that unanimity was rejected and that that is the correct view. Is -- So I -- I -- we are not entirely repudiating the -- the Apodaca judgment.
And we do have 50 years of reliance, which is why I emphasize that we have 32,000 people who are incarcerated right now at hard labor for serious crimes, and every one of them would be subject -- would -- would be able to file an appeal. Do you think 32,000 people were non-unanimous? No, no, no, Justice Breyer. Or how -- I mean, I can't -- I don't understand why it would apply to people who were unanimously convicted, maybe, but -- but I think the stronger case would be those people convicted by juries that were not unanimous.
And how many of those are there? We don't know, because they -- I mean -- -- there wasn't -- -- have you any idea? Is there -- with all the work gone into this, has anybody got any rough idea of what percentage of those people who are convicted are convicted by non-unanimous juries? There's just no reliable data. Well, if there's -- But I can -- -- no reliable data, we'd think -- can I fairly think if there had been some data, even if you just take a sample, you would be telling us? And, therefore, the fact that you're telling us that there are a lot of people in jail, which I did know -- Well -- (Laughter.) -- that that suggests something. Well -- Now, then you say there's you, there's Oregon, that they're waiting.
All right.
But Puerto Rico is a tough case, actually.
There's a Hispanic tradition, and I don't know, you might have to bring up the Insular Cases.
You might -- you might have to revise them.
You might have -- get into the status question.
Puerto Rico is worrying me. So is there -- is there something you want to say about that since you raised it? Well, we have the same tradition, but I -- but the -- the -- You have the same tradition, but you don't have as a matter of fact the whole system of trials that grows out of the civil tradition.
Or is it -- Well, that's why I think all 32,000 -- Well, all right, skip that.
That wasn't -- -- are at risk because we do have a system built around -- I got past the 32,000.
I now want to know, since you've looked into Puerto Rico, is there a particular problem there if we overturn Apodaca? I believe -- If we -- -- there is. I know you believe there is.
I just want to know what there is, rather than my making it up. Because the territorial decisions were based on the authority of Congress to write laws that were different for territories notwithstanding the fact that they still came under the protection of the Constitution, I think that there's a problem. So it's the same -- I mean, the issue here is, does the -- the Sixth Amendment require unanimity? And unless you're going to continue a special carveout for the territories, then they have the same question. Is the -- the 32,000 -- is the reason you don't know because the jury is not typically polled or -- or what? Because it is not always polled and because the defense -- that is a responsibility of the defense to do that.
And even in some cases where it may have been, it may not have been recorded or kept.
And so the data -- the -- the case files are -- seem to be very inconsistent on this. We do know that we are already receiving a flood of these cases, as is this Court.
We know that -- you know, we filed 25 briefs in the Louisiana Supreme Court last Friday.
So we have a -- this case -- this is certainly unsettling the cases, but because a number of those people pleaded guilty based on their expectation of potential -- of facing a 10-2 verdict, the criminal defense attorneys filed an amicus brief arguing that point. We also have people who would receive -- everyone that went to trial received this jury instruction.
So we're not saying they all win.
We are saying -- All right.
Maybe I -- -- that every one of them could file.
And it's like throwing -- I -- I've got the -- the reliance point. Okay. The -- the -- if I believe, one, contrary to what you say, assume it, I believe that, in fact, the federal right in the Constitution does include unanimity in the Sixth Amendment. Then, two, I think that thereafter it was fairly clear in the law that same -- the federal rules apply to states, if we incorporate.
But you do have a point if you say there are anomalies in the law.
And perhaps we should leave the anomaly alone.
And that's where you bring in your reason, the reason being that 32,000 people, et cetera, et cetera.
Okay. I've got that structure. Is there any other instance you can think of where, despite a contradiction, which you're allowing under my assumptions to remain, a legal contradiction, the Court says: Okay, because let sleeping dogs lie; otherwise we get serious harm? Just a footnote. That's not taken care of by Teague and the other doctrines your adversary talked about. Your Honor, I think that one of the -- the -- the significant lines of jurisprudence that comes to my mind is Rowe.
I mean, I -- I, you know, hesitate to bring that into this, but I -- I do think that's an area and I think that any time you have a non-textual right that -- that the Court has relied on, discussed, related to in passing, I mean, or -- or quoted in passing over time and changed the incorporation doctrine, that it is that much more important to get the text and the history right. So we think that Apodaca was -- that the judgment in Apodaca was correct.
We do have enormous reliance interests -- Counsel, on -- -- involved. -- your reliance interests, you say we should worry about the 32,000 people imprisoned.
One might wonder whether we should worry about their interests under the Sixth Amendment as well. And then I -- I can't help but wonder, well, should we forever ensconce an incorrect view of the United States Constitution for perpetuity, for all states and all people, denying them a right that we believe was originally given to them because of 32,000 criminal convictions in Louisiana? No, Justice Gorsuch. But we don't believe that it was a right that was given to them in the Sixth Amendment. I understand that. I'm talking about a reliance argument.
Doesn't that greatly diminish a single state's claim of reliance with respect to a subset of criminal convictions, when we're talking about a constitution that's supposed to endure? No one, and least of all me, is going to stand here and diminish anyone's liberty interests.
I -- I think that -- so I'm not -- I -- I wouldn't take that position. But even in a long line of this Court's significant decisions related to criminal law and criminal procedure, the Court has applied them in a forward fashion instead of retroactively.
So, I mean, that's a concern for us. Well, if the jury -- But that's -- that's not -- the case of retroactivity to convictions that are already final is not before us.
It would come before us in a case if you lose this one, but it -- that -- that is not a question that we can properly address here.
It hasn't been briefed.
It hasn't been decided below. Justice Ginsburg, we certainly do appreciate you not addressing that issue without our opportunity to brief it.
I would point out that our law that we just passed makes the law -- it -- it does draw a line and it says that it will apply to all crime, that unanimity will apply to crimes that were committed after January 1st, 2019. So to some extent we are talking about at -- at least some retroactivity, because we've already made a decision to address it going forward. Can I pick up on Justice Gorsuch's question a second? So assume that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity.
I know you disagree.
And assume that our law ordinarily requires incorporation against the states of rights that apply against the federal government.
So assume ordinarily it would be incorporated. Then we get to the Apodaca question. It seems to me there are two practical arguments for overruling Apodaca if you accept that's holding.
One is, as Justice Gorsuch -- Gorsuch says, there are defendants who have been convicted and sentenced to life, 10-2 or 11-1, who otherwise would have not been convicted.
So that seems like a serious issue for us to think about in terms of overruling. And the second is that the rule in question here is rooted in a -- in racism, you know, rooted in a desire, apparently, to diminish the voices of black jurors in the late 1890s.
So do either of those two -- and that doesn't go to the Sixth Amendment.
That goes to the stare decisis angle. Do either of those two things -- or I guess I should say why aren't those two things enough to overrule, if you accept the legal premises, which I know you don't, but if you accept those, why aren't those two things enough? Again, unfairness to defendants and rooted in racism. So as -- as to the first question with regard to unfairness to defendants, I just do not see how you can separate this from the six-man jury that -- that was approved of in Williams, which is a six-man jury for all crimes less than capital, and six, granted, unanimous rule but still only six, and Louisiana's rule will -- still requires ten. So I -- I don't think it's fundamentally unfair, nor do I think that this Court in any precedent has ever held that it is. But Williams held that the number, the number of jurors was not at the heart of the jury trial right.
The Court said it was a historical accident.
It resembled certain biblical references like 12 apostles, 12 tribes of Israel.
There was nothing inevitable about the number 12.
But there was about the requirement that, whatever the number is, they all agree. Mr. Chief Justice? You may respond. Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think that it was not an historical accident.
I would disagree with that -- that description. I think that these two things were married together in every description, the number 12 and unanimous in every description, have always -- But, it's hard -- -- been married together. It's hard to say you disagree when Williams described the number 12 as a historical accident.
Did you just say Williams was wrong in that respect? I think that characterization of it was dismissive.
That's all.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Fisher. Thank you.
I'd like to make a couple of quick factual points and then talk about stare decisis and reliance. Justice Breyer, you asked a couple of questions about numbers and facts.
So we say in our reply brief, using one of the state's own filings, that there are 36 cases on direct review right now in Louisiana where this issue has been presented. And then even within those 36 is -- even within that 36 you're going to have arguments about whether it was adequately preserved and all the rest.
And so we think, at least in the direct review level, the numbers are actually quite modest and low. And as the Court has described throughout the -- the last half of the argument, the retroactivity questions can be left for another day and covered by their own reliance doctrines. You also asked about Puerto Rico. In Footnote 10 of our brief, we note that the Court held in Balzac that the right to jury trial does not apply the same way in Puerto Rico as to the states.
And so that would be a question about the Insular Cases.
You're going to be talking about that next week, perhaps. But it's something that this case doesn't -- doesn't necessarily address. So as to stare decisis and reliance, let me make a couple points about the state's framing of its arguments and then talk about, I think, Justice Kagan, your sort of alternative framing of the arguments. As to the state's framing of the arguments, I think it's helpful to remember why we have the stare decisis in the first place. It's about settled expectations in the law. And what we're asking you today to do are to reaffirm two things the Court has said many, many times over the years.
One is the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous verdict. And, second, when an incorporated provision applies to the states, it applies the same way as it does to the federal government. So to write that opinion all you have to do is reaffirm what you said many, many times under the law. It is the state's position that it would create upheaval as to the law.
It would raise questions like the one the Chief Justice asked about whether seven to five is okay. The state not only doesn't answer the question in its brief, it provides no way, no way to answer the question.
And that would just be one of many questions that would arise if you agreed with the state's view. So I think then you are left with the alternative argument, that what about -- what about putting a reliance interest into Apodaca itself? I'm not sure, by the way, that Oregon does that.
I think it's also telling that Oregon is not willing to defend.
I know it doesn't go the other way like the state does but it certainly isn't willing to defend Justice Powell's reasoning in Apodaca. But let's imagine that argument were in front of the Court.
I think there is three reasons why you would still overrule Apodaca. The first is the one that a couple of you mentioned, which is that it's not just -- it's not just the interests of the state that have to be taken into account.
It's the interests of defendants. And before we take away somebody's liberty over 600 years of common law tradition, and Sixth Amendment tradition, is we demand a unanimous verdict, unanimous consent of a cross-section of the community. And that is important, as the social science brief in this case shows, for accuracy, public confidence, and all the rest.
And so those reliance interests, which -- by the way, the state itself is not renouncing unanimous verdicts; it maintains the ability under its law to try anyone going forward for a crime committed before January 1st, 2019, and seek a 10-2 verdict.
And so that could go on for years, and that ought to be taken into account. Secondly, I think incorporation is just different.
I think that's the lesson of the sweep of this Court's cases, is reliance interests are less important when it comes to incorporation because the Bill of Rights themselves are so important.
When the Court says something is a fundamental rule under our way of doing criminal justice, the states have to follow that rule the same way as the federal government. And then the last thing I think that makes this case different than an ordinary stare decisis case is the vote in Apodaca.
It's not just that it was a 4-1-4 vote, but it's just that -- it's that the other eight justices rejected the decisive reasoning in that case. And I think that makes this almost a universe of one. And if I could push it even further, I would say that if you have any doubts, look at Justice Powell's reasoning.
Justice Powell's reasoning in Apodaca itself was based on a refusal to follow precedent.
What he said was I'm agreeing with the past dissenters.
I know you have this rule from Malloy against Hogan from five years ago that requires the same standards to apply in a federal court as they apply -- in state court as they apply in federal court, but I don't want to follow that rule. He didn't even try to distinguish the Court's old holding.
So in a sense Apodaca itself was born of a disregard for stare decisis.
And so if you feel strongly about stare decisis as a value, this case is almost singular in its -- in its -- in the compelling reasons right now to -- to overrule Apodaca. Since you mentioned Balzac, can I ask you a question about that? So let's imagine this case is decided in your favor, and then a -- a defendant who has been convicted by a non-unanimous verdict in Puerto Rico comes here and he says, look, I am a citizen of the United States, and the only reason why I was able to be convicted by a non-unanimous verdict is -- are these old Insular Cases that reflect attitudes of the day in the -- in the end of the -- after the -- the aftermath of the Spanish American War, and just as you brushed aside Apodaca, you should brush aside the Insular Cases. I think I would -- I would say that would be different for all the reasons I just outlined.
The Insular Cases were majority decisions from the Court.
They were -- they were based on a view that has not been disregarded or left behind in the Court's jurisprudence. There may be arguments parties can make under ordinary stare decisis principles, but the last point I would leave you with is this is not an ordinary stare decisis case. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-938, Ritzen Group versus Jackson Masonry. Mr. Lehman. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 28 U.S.C. Section 158 provides that district courts shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final order of bankruptcy judges entered in cases and proceedings referred to bankruptcy judges under Section 157. The order in this case merely determined where the parties would litigate Ritzen's contract claim.
Under Section 158, such an order is not a final order entered in a case or proceeding. As this Court determined just four terms ago in Bullard versus Blue Hills Bank, the fact that an order disposes of a proceeding is not, despite what -- despite what Respondent and the government contends, the test for determining finality.
That, in the words of the Court, slices the case too thin. Rather, an immediately appealable order is determined by considering the larger process at issue and whether the order is final by examining whether it alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties. In Bullard, the relevant process was the plan confirmation process.
Here, the relevant process is the claims adjudication or the claims allowance process under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code. As in Bullard, the order here did not resolve the larger process.
It did not alter the status quo, nor did it fix the obligations of the parties.
On the contrary, it simply continued the automatic stay so the underlying claim would proceed in bankruptcy court. In arguing otherwise, Respondent and the government badly misperceived the role of the automatic stay in bankruptcy cases. The automatic stay is not itself one of the substantive processes of bankruptcy.
It is a utility provision that supports the operation of these other processes.
In fact, it was Jackson who argued that Ritzen's motion for relief triggered the claims adjudication process, claiming the stay motion constituted an informal proof of claim. Such an order changes little and, in the words of this Court, does not alter the status quo or fix the rights and obligations of the parties. Contrary to what the government has represented in its brief, Section 158 was not actually enacted in 1978.
In fact, Section 158 was enacted in 1984.
The reason this, what appears to be a small mistake, I believe, is a very significant matter because it misunderstands the history of the bankruptcy jurisdictional framework. But, as I understand what you've just said, you're not contesting that this was a proceeding.
You're just saying it wasn't a final order in the proceeding.
Is that right? That's correct.
As this Court noted in Bullard, there's an endless number of contested matters, many of which are not -- are -- are of a less significant nature. The question is not on what is a proceeding but what is on an immediately appealable proceeding.
And in Bullard, the Court looked at the process to determine whether or not that had the indicia of finality. And when would that -- when would it become final? At the end of the case? We would submit that it would become final under this Court's test that when the status quo changed, and when the rights and obligations of the parties were fixed. And when would that -- For example -- -- yeah.
And when would that be? Well, for example, Rule 8002 actually lays out a fascinating -- a very good framework for final orders because it determines what orders cannot be extended in terms of time frame. The first under 8002(d)(2)(A) is the granting of the automatic stay cannot be extended, but the denial of the automatic stay isn't mentioned.
The second one, the authorization of a sale under 363, for example. The third one, the authorization of financing under 364. It goes back to the Court's reasoning in Bullard, where the Court determined that there is no -- that there is no symmetry in finality, that, in fact, a final rule is often determined, such as the grant of a motion to dismiss but not a denial -- Well -- -- of a motion to dismiss. -- maybe you could simplify this a little bit for me.
The -- there's a denial of relief from the stay, and when can that party -- when can the party who sought relief from the stay take an appeal, contesting the denial of relief from the stay? When, in the words of this Court, the discrete dispute between the parties are resolved.
I -- When would that happen? As a result -- in this? Yes.
Yeah. In this particular place, at the end of the claims adjudication process. It was the Respondent that said that the claims adjudication process was triggered by the motion to lift the stay. Yeah, okay.
And at that point, isn't the issue of whether there should have been relief from the stay moot? No.
This Court has recognized at least three different occasions that that is not an unreviewable decision, that that is a decision, as a result of a single appeal rule, that has to be respected and preserved. Okay.
What relief would be -- could be granted at that point? Just like this Court did in the Olberding case, the Court could vacate the decision and send it back.
Importantly, under Rule 502(j), it's specifically allowed under the bankruptcy code. Under Rule 502(j), a -- an order that -- a claim that has been allowed or disallowed can be changed.
An allowed claim can be disallowed.
A disallowed claim can be -- Okay.
So the court -- -- allowed for -- for good reason. -- says there should have been -- on appeal, there should have been relief from the -- from the stay.
So what does that do for the party who sought relief from the stay? I think your argument has to be that undoes everything that happened since that point, right? Well, with respect, it's no different than a motion to remand, a motion to transfer venue.
It's a motion to deny a -- a denial of a motion to abstain under -- Well, it's a little different because the bankruptcy has gone on, right? The bankruptcy has concluded, and part of the bankruptcy is you're divvying things up, and depending on how much this person gets, that person gets more, and -- but now you say you've got to go back and start over with respect to one person's claim. I -- I don't understand how you can unscramble that egg. But this is something that bankruptcy lawyers deal with every single day.
It can be done through a variety of matters, but, as a practical matter, Your Honor, given the length of the typical bankruptcy and the length of the appeal, it wouldn't be unscrambled before the bankruptcy process was entered -- ended in the first place. As a practical matter, as we cite to you in our reply brief, in the footnote on page 19, the average bankruptcy case is concluded in seven months.
The average appeal -- the first appeal takes nine months.
In this case, the second appeal took a little bit less time than that. But -- so, as a practical matter, there is no such thing as undoing because whether you took the appeal at the moment that the stay relief was denied or at the moment that the claims adjudication process was ended, you are still going to have an appeal that extended well beyond the plan confirmation process. And that's why bankruptcy lawyers deal with this issue of claim contingency all the time, and they work with reserves, just like they did here.
And the parties agreed that they would not object to the plan on the condition that this appeal could go forward.
And there was a security set aside in the amount of $400,000. Now we don't believe that that's the entirety of our damages, but that's the security that the parties agreed to.
And if that's less than -- if that's not enough to cover our damages, then that's the risk that we took in agreeing to that claim filing. Would you have had the right, if you chose, not to waste your time in adjudicating this in bankruptcy court and choosing -- could you have chosen to appeal immediately after the injunction was denied? Your Honor, I missed the first part of your question, and so I -- Assuming you wished not to incur the expense and time of adjudicating this in the bankruptcy proceeding, could you have chosen at the time the injunction order denying the request to lift the stay was issued, could you have appealed then? I believe that under 158 there's an interlocutory operation, 158(a)(c), as well as 1292(a).
By definition -- So the answer is yes? Yes, Your Honor -- So isn't that -- -- as an interlocutory appeal. -- so isn't that a different question, since you accept the responsibility that you could have appealed, isn't the issue whether you should have appealed, and isn't there a split on that question among the circuits? Well, Your Honor, I -- Because what you're basically saying is I didn't have to. With respect, Your Honor, I believe that there are two very important reasons. First of all, it's not a matter of having to.
It's a matter of whether the Court would have allowed us to under the interlocutory standard.
And given the environment that we were in, we did not believe an interlocutory appeal would have been granted. But moreover -- So you're answering me no -- Well -- -- that you couldn't have? I -- I don't know what you're arguing. With respect, the question was could we have appealed. Theoretically, we could have filed an interlocutory appeal. As a practical matter, that's only with leave of court.
And we did not -- and -- and so it wasn't something automatically that we could do. And so, second of all, with respect to the second appeal, the reality was the -- the -- the relationships between the parties were going to result in the second substantive appeal.
The question is whether the Court is going to compel the parties to appeal or whether the parties will be able to consolidate their appeals at the end of the discrete dispute. What's the difference -- is it the case that a creditor says to the bankruptcy judge: Judge, I don't want to be here.
Go lift the automatic stay.
And the judge says, you're right. Now can the debtor appeal? Yes, Your Honor. Okay.
If the debtor can appeal then, why can't the creditor appeal if he reaches the opposite conclusion? In both cases, I imagine the immediate appeal is given because, in many instances, though certainly not all, getting rid of a creditor or keeping a creditor will change in a pretty significant way the nature of the final plan. Now what have I said wrong? With respect, this Court addressed that very issue in Bullard, and the Court said that confirmations of a plan change the status quo and set the rights and obligations of a party.
But denials, while the parties continue to negotiate, do not do that. The -- They don't do that. Why not? Why not? If we have an imaginary case where a creditor who happens to make this motion has $100 million, and everybody else taken all together has $3.50.
Okay? Now it seems to me that getting rid of that creditor would change the nature of the final plan.
Wouldn't it? If the merits -- I don't think Bullard was addressing that issue. Not exactly, Your Honor, but it was certainly addressing the question -- All right. -- of the symmetry that the court -- Okay.
So what's the answer to that issue? I'm not saying symmetry automatically makes the same result. All I am saying, it seemed to me, being very much an amateur in this field, but you are not, that the reason for allowing the initial appeal, were they to grant it, is because of the enormous change that might work in the nature of the plan.
And if that's the reason, the same thing is true when you deny it. Now is -- that's what I'm getting at as a question.
I'm not giving you an answer.
I want to know what you think. And under the Bullard standard, I do not believe the denial changes the status quo.
As this Court said, the stay remains in effect.
Final does not determine the state of affairs. I see.
So, in other words, in my case, $100 million gone out of the estate, $3.53 left.
That didn't change anything. No, the granting -- the granting does change it.
The status quo is different. No, now we have it the other way. If the stay is agreed -- A hundred million is there -- I've got that part. -- as opposed to the $3.53.
That changes nothing. The Court does not look at the significance of the matter in determining whether or not it's final. I didn't say it did. I just said the reasoning seems to be similar if my reasoning is correct.
That's why I put it as a question. And -- and I would submit the Court answered this question in Bullard, that unless the status quo was changed, that it's not a final order, because it doesn't end that substantive process. If it's a $3.50 creditor that is otherwise excluded from the estate by the granting of the stay, that's a final judgment with respect to that creditor.
If it's a million dollar creditor and that's denied, the status quo is still not changed.
The status quo continues and that creditor continues within the bankruptcy process. Now I may have misunderstood the Court's question, but I believe that was an attempt to answer it. Thank you. It does assume some facts in evidence, that I am more of an expert. (Laughter.) But I will defer to the Court. I would -- I would continue by suggesting that the government's characterization of bankruptcy law is misunderstood. Not only does the government misunderstand the framework for the jurisdiction, overlooking the fact that 158 was not passed in 1978 but was something to remedy 1293, which the court in the First Circuit, In re Sokolow, which this Court has cited favorably, had to address. 1293 did not use the word ""proceedings."" 1293 was -- was drafted in a way that required a final order but without the concept of proceeding. And, there, the First Circuit said we have to -- we -- we look back over 200 years and how this Court has looked at bankruptcy orders and recognized that, in some cases, some bankruptcy proceedings are different, are treated differently.
And, as a result of that, certainly, Congress did not intend to change this under 1293. A year later, Congress fixed that problem with a very elegant solution in 158.
In 158, they included the word ""proceeding"" to go back and recognize over the last 200 years that there would be some proceedings in bankruptcy that would be final. However, they included a word, a guardrail, to ensure that that did not get out of control, and that guardrail was the word ""final,"" a word that this Court had used and interpreted since Congress enacted the Judiciary Act of 1789 and a word that brings all the soil of 1291 with it. ""Final"" is a term of art.
""Final"" has 200 years of definition behind it.
And that -- and -- and Congress fixed the problem of 1293 through 158. But, to that end, 158, the finality consideration, as this Court recognized and as even the Solicitor General recognized, the finality requirement has significance, has import. It's not just the last order in the sequence.
It's not just the order that disposes of a motion for an extension of time.
It's not the order that disposes of a retention of professionals. Those are not matters that aren't deemed final.
Those don't change the status quo.
Those don't fix the rights and obligations of the parties. Second of all, I believe the government is mistaken about 362(e). Before you go on to that, I'm not sure I quite understand why, if you agree that the motion for relief from the stay is a proceeding, why an order saying, no, I'm not granting relief from the proceeding, is not final? Well, as this Court noted in Bullard, there are literally countless numbers of proceedings in contested matters. But it stretches the concept of finality to assume that the -- the order that disposes of all those proceedings meets the qualification of what this Court called an immediately appealable order. So what if the order denying relief from the stay says and this is the final word on this subject.
This is not going to be reexamined.
It's not final? No, because the stay by its very nature can -- is -- is fluid.
As even the Sixth Circuit recognized, facts and circumstances can change. Even the Respondent cited a case from the Tenth Circuit at page 38 of their brief where they talk about how the court had granted relief from the stay.
Ten months later reconsidered it. The First Circuit in the Atlas case, the basis for their ruling, because there were competing -- there was a first to file rule question between two district judges. The First Circuit said the order of the -- of -- of the stay relief isn't final. Things can change that would cause the Puerto Rican judge to decide that the Virginia judge should go forward. And at that point, the bankruptcy court will have to once reconsider whether the stay applies, whether the stay is final.
But the stay by its very nature is fluid. It's no different than the way this Court analyzed a motion to deny a -- a -- a request for abstention under the Gulf Aerospace case versus Mayacamas. There, the Court rejected the concept of the collateral order doctrine because the first -- the first requirement was that the issue be conclusively resolved.
And the Court looked at that and said: Abstention, three months -- months from now, the district court may decide that the state court matter should go forward.
And so this cannot be a final order by definition because it doesn't conclusively resolve the issue. Now I would like to also point out that, with respect to the injunction that is claimed here, that's defeated by the very terms of the rule.
Under 363(c)(2)(C), the code says that the -- that the stay expires upon the discharge.
That's a -- that's something that this Court recognized just last term in Taggart versus Lorenzen, that there is a distinction between the automatic stay and the injunction. There's no -- and -- and even going back to Celotex in 1995, there's no textual basis to believe that there is a permanent injunction with the stay that, by its very nature, and even Congress in the same legislative history that the government cites admits, is temporary. And then, finally, I would argue that they're mistaken about the application of 362(e).
362(e) is a very different part of the motion -- of the -- of the stay than 362(d)(1). 362(e) relates to actions against the property as opposed to actions against the debtor. Now, in this case, we're seeking -- we sought relief under 362(d)(1), for cause.
We did not bring basically what was an in rem action or an action regarding a secured party under relief under 362(e).
There was a lot of ink spilled on the question of 362(e), the injunction, the -- the fact that there was a preliminary hearing and a final hearing.
I would submit to the Court that those concepts are not applicable here. What is critical here is that the Respondent dragged the motion to lift the stay into the claims adjudication process.
It was the Respondent who, in responding to the motion to lift the stay, objected as an informal proof of claim. By objecting as an informal proof of claim, the Respondent is triggering the entire claims adjudication process.
And, of course, after that point, we filed an adversarial proceeding.
They filed an adversarial proceeding.
We had competing proofs of claim. That is the claims adjudication process under Chapter 5, 501, the submission of a claim; 502, objection; 503, the resolution of that claim by the court.
That is the broader substantive bankruptcy process that was resolved here. But this Court has never recognized that decisions about where to -- where to litigate are final orders when they're denied. When they're granted, that's one thing.
That changes the status quo.
That dismisses the case.
But, when they're denied, those are not final orders. And, finally, I would also point out that the -- from a policy perspective, the question here, as the Court looked in Bullard, the Court noted that if the Court had ruled otherwise, it could possibly give the debtor greater leverage over the creditors because the debtor could hold up the creditors with a threat of appeals. That same dynamic applies here.
If you allow creditors or, I should say, if you force creditors to take appeals on early preliminary matters, the definition of which is very -- is impossible to define the limits of under the Respondent's suggested rules, you're going to tilt the playing field with respect to those negotiations. Debtors are in bankruptcy for a reason.
They have limited resources.
And to allow or force creditors whose motions are denied -- I'm not talking about the motions that are granted; that's the exchange we had earlier -- but creditors whose motions are denied to immediately take those appeals is going to change the way the bankruptcy process works. Now I think that we've even seen that right now with the Sixth Circuit. Well, most -- most of the courts of appeals have that rule, though. Well, with respect, Your Honor, I believe that that rule is dated -- is based in most of those cases on an outdated anachronism under a former bankruptcy rule, Rule 701.
The reality is the only two courts to have considered this in any detail within the last 10 years has been the First Circuit, and that was three months after their ruling in the Bullard case that this Court then affirmed, and the Sixth Circuit. The other circuits, I would submit their rulings are largely based -- and if you look at the majority of them over the last two decades, it would be grants or denials in a very summary, often in a footnote or in dicta, as opposed to a careful analysis of this issue. In reality, under the old bankruptcy rule, under 701, they had to file an adversarial proceeding in order to challenge the stay. Under the new bankruptcy rules, under 4001, that's a contested matter.
It's not an adversarial proceeding. But, in filing an adversarial proceeding under Rule 701, there was often a claim for relief, claim 1, just like a declaratory judgment action; claim 2, breach of contract.
And in many of those cases, the underlying merits were determined. When the rules changed in 1984 from 701 to 7001, challenges to stays no longer were raised as adversarial proceedings.
Instead, they were raised under Rule 4001 as a contested matter. So it's understandable that courts in the '82 to '84 circa were deeming a motion to lift the stay in an adversarial proceeding context as a discrete substantive dispute between the parties that often resolved a discrete, within that proceeding. Your theory under the Bullard test is that the denial of relief from the stay does not alter the status quo for the creditor, is that right? Your Honor, it doesn't alter the status quo for either one. And why is that on the status quo? I guess this might depend on how you define status quo, but it's going to prevent the creditor from enforcing judgments and seizing property, and the creditor is going to lose money.
So I guess that depends on status quo, but they're going to have effects. No, the status quo is -- is -- was determined at the date of the filing of the bankruptcy. Right. It was originally dating back to the filing of the bankruptcy.
And as this Court noted in Bullard, when the plan confirmation was denied, the stay continued. The status quo did not change. What we're contending is nothing changed in the bankruptcy court -- End on that. I'm sorry. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dunham. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 158 of the judicial code provides for a district court's jurisdiction over final decisions and orders that are issued in proceedings.
In this case, it appears as though Ritzen has conceded that a stay relief motion and a notice to the debtor and a hearing on that motion constitutes a proceeding. So the only issue now is whether or not that order issued by the bankruptcy court was, indeed, final.
With respect to finality, this Court can simply borrow to the age-old tradition of what finality means under Section 1291 of the judicial code, and that is whether or not the order leaves nothing else to do except for execute upon the judgment, in this case, the decision. The bankruptcy court made it very clear that upon entry of the order dismissing -- I'm sorry, the order denying the motion for relief from the automatic stay, there was only one thing to do, and that was to have the claims adjudication process happen within the bankruptcy case. Therefore, that was a final decision that conclusively terminated the proceeding. There was nothing left to do for the parties, except to take the issues between the two, the claims and the counterclaims, and have them resolved by the bankruptcy court. Well, there's nothing -- nothing left to do between the parties other than litigate the case. That's correct, Your Honor. Well, that's kind of a big part of the whole thing. (Laughter.) Right, and the important nuance there is there's nothing left to do with respect to the decision that denied stay relief. Certainly, there was going to have to be some negotiations, possibly some litigation, within the context of the bankruptcy case. But, with respect to the stay relief motion, that decision, there was nothing left to do upon entry of that decision to execute upon the judge's decision that all the claims adjudication would have to run through the bankruptcy case. A summary judgment motion, once it's decided, there's nothing left to do in respect to the summary judgment motion. All there is, is, as the Chief just said, litigate the entire case.
Do you want to say the summary judgment motion is final? Your Honor, a grant of a summary judgment is -- is indeed final.
And -- So we can appeal, and everybody's going to appeal from the summary judgment motions? Yes, Your Honor, those would be raised within the context of an adversary proceeding. What about a regular case out of bankruptcy court? Yes, Your Honor. Well, I never heard of that, that you could appeal immediately from the denial of summary judgment. Oh, not -- not from the denial of summary judgment.
No, Your Honor.
I -- sorry, I understood the question to mean a grant of summary judgment. No, no, no.
That would be the case, obviously.
But we're here talking about a denial of the motion, not a grant. That's correct.
So, Your Honor, in the context of a denial of summary judgment within an adversary proceeding in a bankruptcy case -- I'm not literally talking about summary judgment.
I'm just repeating really what the question of the Chief is and want you to focus on that, that the fact that it's over in respect to what the particular motion is about doesn't necessarily prove that it's a final judgment. Maybe there are other things that are. Deny a request to call a witness.
That is over in respect to the witness calling, but the case, it's not a final decision you can appeal, you see. I mean, that's, I think, the thrust of the question.
So that -- that's what I think we wanted you to hear. And, Your Honor, I believe that, to answer your question, I believe in the oral argument in Bullard, the -- Justice Breyer, you had mentioned the fact that Collier's identifies approximately 47 contested matters.
And so, to the extent that someone is denied the opportunity to call a witness, that wouldn't be a proceeding. I'm not being literal.
Maybe you want to say something extra about why this is final. And if you do, I apologize for interrupting your -- your two minutes opening, so I at least will not ask -- ask a question for the next two minutes. No, Your Honor. (Laughter.) Nor will I because I had those two. (Laughter.) Old habits are hard to break.
I apologize. Your Honor, for -- for the Court's edification, I waive my right for any of the two minutes.
It's better -- (Laughter.) I anticipated that's what you were doing. (Laughter.) Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor. (Laughter.) So the question about finality is -- is whether or not any decision is final determines -- is determined by whether or not there is anything left to do except for execute on it. The real hurdle is whether or not it constitutes a proceeding.
So, certainly, the claims adjudication process was going to be subsequent to the stay relief motion and that stay relief proceeding.
However, the finality of the stay relief order cannot be dictated by a future proceeding that is going to result in litigation.
It's going to -- Why not? Meaning what Ritzen points out is that in the proceeding that's going on, the issue of bad faith is going to be litigated. And during that litigation, the motion can be renewed to lift the stay and if, you know, part of -- or lift the stay.
So it's not final/final in the sense of it's subject to renewal under changed circumstances, so -- Yes, Your Honor, there are two responses to your question.
The first one relates to the reason for the filing of a stay relief motion. In this case, they asserted bad faith, but a reason for filing is not -- is different than whether or not there has been a denial of the relief requested.
So the sole relief that was requested was going back to state court. The reasons for going back to state court were rooted somewhat in bad faith.
So the Court's determination of whether or not the reasons were valid is simply an evidentiary issue that is subject -- I'm not -- I'm not sure that quite gets there. No, no, please go ahead. No, no, I think we're asking the same thing, which is forget about the reasons.
Just forget about them. Forget about the nature of the claim.
There is a lift stay request.
It has been denied. It can be subject to reconsideration later.
That's Justice Sotomayor's point.
And I think you'd agree -- maybe -- maybe you'd tell me that's wrong, it can't be ever revisited, but, if it can be, does that pose a problem for you? It does not.
And I would say that in response to the question about whether or not there could be a renewed stay relief motion, certainly, any party can file a motion at any time seeking relief from a prior order that's been entered. However, in the context of a stay relief order that's been denied, any renewed motion, if based on the same facts, certainly is going to be denied for law of the case and for other estoppel reasons. Well, no, no.
I mean, a judge is free to change his or her mind -- Yes. -- during the life of a case and find it persuasive today but didn't find it persuasive yesterday.
That's the nature of interlocutory orders. And, again, I'm just -- I may be beating a dead horse, but I think this is what the Chief Justice, whose two minutes I'm sure is up by now, Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and now me are asking all basically the same thing, is how do you call something final if it's subject to reconsideration by a judge for a considerable period of time? And, Your Honor, I will submit that reconsideration or the filing of a renewed stay relief motion does not determine that a prior order that's been issued is final or interlocutory. It's simply a creation of a new proceeding, if there is a renewed motion based on a change of circumstances, because like, in any bankruptcy case, certainly, the facts can change during the duration or the pendency of the case. But what an anomaly.
You concede that a motion to dismiss if denied is not immediately appealable. Yes. But now you're saying that a motion to lift a stay is and must -- not only is but must be immediately appealable.
There's a dichotomy there.
They're the same thing.
They're based on the same argument, bad faith. Why should we have one piecemeal litigation and one not? The simple answer to your question, Justice Sotomayor, is that a motion to dismiss, a motion for a change of venue, a motion for remand, all of those are not proceedings. If they are denied simply because there is no alteration of the status quo and the denial does not fix the rights and obligations of the parties, it doesn't move the case forward, and, therefore, to use the Court's words, it changes little. A stay relief motion is entirely different.
That is the opportunity for a court to lift one of the most fundamental building blocks of any bankruptcy case. And, therefore, when the judge ultimately and finally and conclusively terminates that proceeding by denying the stay relief, it not only informs the court -- I'm sorry, informs the movant that the litigation has to occur in bankruptcy case, but it also prevents that creditor from being able to rely upon the state court right to a jury trial, the state court Rules of Evidence, the state court Rule of Procedure, the ability to adjudicate the claim in state court as it could have done but for the existence of the bankruptcy petition. And, therefore, it does change a lot. And it does move the case forward by denying their relief from stay so that the parties can adjudicate it in bankruptcy court. It's also important to note that although Ritzen disagrees with this contention, both the -- the government and Jackson Masonry on the same page that the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates effectively a temporary restraining order.
And this is based on the legislative history in other courts. The preliminary hearing on stay relief creates a de facto preliminary injunction.
When the order is finally denied -- the -- I'm sorry, the motion is finally denied, that's akin to a permanent injunction that's going to remain in place until discharge, case closure, case dismissal, or when the property revests in the debtor. That's -- that's simply the fixing of the rights of the parties because, once that denial of stay relief is entered and the permanent injunction effectively goes into place, the ability to file a relief from the stay under 362, it goes away.
And so it certainly does move the case forward and it certainly -- it disposes of a discrete dispute within the larger bankruptcy case. Could I ask you to respond to your friend's comments on the difficulties or lack of difficulties of an entanglement, I guess I'll call it? In other words, the fact that the one -- in the absence of finality, that the case would require going back to the unraveling what had happened in the bankruptcy without the claims being adjudicated in the state proceeding? Yes, Your Honor.
I believe that the term that was used was whether or not it's going to unscramble the bankruptcy case.
And, certainly, there is a stay relief denial, and then there is case administration. There's negotiations.
There are plan proposals. Ultimately, in this case, there's plan confirmation where creditors are provided treatment and then Jackson Masonry is able to perform under the plan. Ritzen now seeks to wait until the end of the bankruptcy case, without objecting to the plan, after confirmation, after the adjudication of its claim, to which it expressly consented to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, and now it wants to ask this Court to ultimately provide it a path to go back to state court and get a different result. And that different result would blow up the entire bankruptcy case.
If Ritzen is correct at the state court level, which we obviously posit it wouldn't be, but if it could go back, that changes the entire dynamics of the bankruptcy case.
Creditors have already been paid in this case.
The plan has been substantially consummated.
There are a number of hours that are involved in that entire process. You're not arguing the case is moot, are you? I certainly believe that the case is equitably moot on several grounds. Legally moot? I don't believe it's legally moot.
I believe that it's equitably moot.
And if I may, Your Honor, answer the question as to why that is. Equitable mootness, at least the mootness standard, the mootness principle is founded upon the simple position, whereas whether this Court is able to fashion a remedy that restores Ritzen to the previous position, it cannot in this case, because there, one, has been a plan that's been proposed and confirmed that included a discharge, and also included a plan injunction against proceeding that has not been appealed. Ritzen tries to argue in its reply and argued at the podium today that that was carved out in connection with plan confirmation, but it wasn't.
If the Court can look at the docket, it can see that only the claim objection and the two adversary proceedings were carved out. And so the one remaining issue that has been appealed that was not carved out was the denial of the stay relief.
So now that Jackson Masonry has obtained that plan confirmation that has resulted in a discharge, revesting of the property, and a plan injunction, it is effectively moot because there is no automatic stay that exists. If there's no automatic stay that exists, how can Ritzen get relief from the automatic stay in connection with a future appellate proceeding? That's the first part. The second part is that nothing required Ritzen to consent to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, but it filed an adversary proceeding and without reservation and allowed the bankruptcy court to determine the case to finality. This Court in Caterpillar versus Lewis had a similar type of situation where the Court ultimately concluded that a -- that a procedural defect is not fatal if a federal adjudication exists and there was jurisdiction at the time of entry of the judgment. That's what we have here.
We have an adjudication on the merits of the breach of contract claim.
Ritzen consented to it.
Nobody contests that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction.
And now it wants to unwind it and do what this Court proscribed by allowing for the exorbitant cost of a dual trial when a district court sitting with jurisdiction has already made a decision. That's true, but, in every case throughout the entire legal system, there's always a choice of the kind at issue here. If you say that you have to wait 'til the end of the case to appeal the result you don't like of a motion, if, for example, X wants to leave, the trial judge -- the bankruptcy judge or the trial judge -- no, okay? If you have to wait 'til the end of the case and appeal it, if your -- if the judge was right, no problem.
But, if he was wrong and you were right, everything has to be done all over. So you say give them an immediate appeal.
If you give an immediate appeal, what happens is what he said.
You have all that time of nine months of having an intermediate appeal. If there are a thousand creditors, they might all do it.
And God only knows how long this case is going to take.
That's why they have big backlogs in some other countries.
They're too kindhearted in allowing immediate appeals, okay? So do you want to say something about that? I -- How do we balance those two? I would love to respond to it.
And there are two things that I would respond to.
One is every creditor in the country should be lining up behind our side of the podium here, and the reason is because what Ritzen is proposing is to moot every creditor's ability to obtain meaningful relief on appeal when the stay relief order was denied. And that's simply because upon plan confirmation and discharge occurs, there is no stay in place and, therefore, any party who tries to appeal the -- the denial, it's immediately moot and it's going to be dismissed. So I would say that, to answer the first question, is that there might be more appeals during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, but those would be meaningful appeals. And creditors need to have the ability to have meaningful appeal, not one that gets mooted. The second issue that I have with Ritzen's position and that responds to Your Honor's question is that we have to presume that actors -- that creditors are going to act in their own economic interest in connection with a bankruptcy case. In a case like this, where the bankruptcy court is saying that we're going to adjudicate it through a truncated summary claims adjudication procedure, that a creditor is not going to spend a lot of time and a lot of money on an appeal process just to get to an even lengthier and more expensive state court when it could be resolved. Debtor side lawyers, we're not afraid of appeals during bankruptcy case.
And, certainly, to the extent that this piecemeal litigation continues to -- to crop its head in this case, piecemeal litigation is the concern about extending the length of a bankruptcy case. And -- I'm sorry, extending the length of -- of -- of any case. But bankruptcy is different because, obviously, it's an aggregation of many individual disputes.
And the -- the concern is that if you wait until the end of a case, that's an additional time where a debtor remains in bankruptcy, certainly is not credit-worthy when financing is important, it has to incur the United States trustee fees that are always going to be incurring so long as the case is open, and lastly, the competitors of a debtor are able to use the existence of bankruptcy against them in the marketplace. They argue from the language in Bullard that the -- the ""alter the status quo"" language in Bullard that this doesn't -- the denial here doesn't meet that test.
Can you address that? I certainly can.
Justice Kavanaugh, the reason that Bullard is -- is perfectly consistent, obviously, Bullard stands for the proposition that an order denying confirmation is interlocutory for obvious reasons.
In that case, the debtor had an opportunity to amend, did not -- I'm focusing on -- -- move the case forward. -- that precise language, ""alter the status quo."" So if you can zero in on that. Yes.
So alteration of the status quo in our case comes from two different levels.
One is because the court unequivocally decided that the claims adjudication process would be in bankruptcy. So, prior to that ruling, it was an unknown as to whether or not it was going to be adjudicated in the state court or bankruptcy court.
The court made it clear. The second reason is, to use our injunction analogy, is that you have various stages of the injunction process.
We all know that a permanent injunction -- or at least our position is that a permanent injunction can be and should be immediately appealable. And so, to the extent that the petition creates a TRO, preliminary hearing creates a preliminary injunction, and then the denial of a motion to dismiss is effectively an injunction against that creditor for the duration of the bankruptcy case, until it gets revisited. So the alteration of the status quo is the fixation of where the claims are going to be adjudicated and also moving it from just being a creditor who has rights under 362 to one whose rights have been fully exhausted under 362. It's true Bullard did use this phrase ""alteration of the status quo"" and in a particular context, but do you think we should elevate that to an essential element of finality? Is the final order in a case, as ordinarily understood, always one that alters the status quo? Sometimes the effect of the final order is to leave the -- leave the status quo in place. It -- Your Honor, I -- it is our position that the use of the term ""status quo,"" I believe, was used -- was one time in Bullard, and it came to define really what it took to move a case forward.
And so there are -- in subsequent sentences.
So our position is not that status quo needs to be established every time in order for there to be finality. We think status quo is more of a definition of the proceeding as opposed to finality. We compartmentalize it by arguing that finality is looked at by whether or not there's anything left to do.
So a proceeding does involve the status quo.
And so I think that in order to have a proceeding, discrete dispute, significant, and one that moves the case forward, sometimes status quo could move the case forward. So our position is not that that should become a new standard.
However, even with the ""alteration of the status quo"" language used in this case, we believe that the status quo has been altered for the reasons -- The Sixth Circuit viewed it differently than you. No, Your Honor. They -- they seem to think -- Our -- we -- -- of it as part of the finality order. The Sixth Circuit's opinion, we think, is -- is perfect because it considered the fact that you can't have finality unless there's -- if there is without prejudice. Your Honor, I see my time -- Please finish your answer. And so the Sixth Circuit said that the finality test is difficult because we haven't given the parties a test.
But it looked at it in two tranches, the first one being whether or not we had a proceeding and whether or not it was final. It's our position that the Sixth Circuit looked at the significant consequences and alteration of the status quo fixing the rights and obligations of the parties to determine the proceeding portion, and then, with respect to finality, that an order is final if -- a little bit different than our position.
An order is final if it does fix the rights and obligations of the parties, again, but there is nothing else that needs to happen in order for the judgment to be executed. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Suri. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'll begin with the questions that were just posed about the status quo language in the Bullard opinion.
It depends on how you understand that language in terms of whether we think it would be a good idea to elevate that into an element of the test or not. If all you mean by ""alter"" -- Of which test? Of proceeding or finality? Finality.
If -- if all you mean by ""alter the status quo"" is fix an obligation that had previously been uncertain, liquidate something that had previously been unascertained, then we're perfectly fine saying that that's a part of finality. If, however, by status quo alteration what is meant is that there is some action out in the world that one party couldn't take that he now is able to take or vice versa, we think that would be an improper understanding of finality. I can give a couple of examples to illustrate that.
If a lawsuit in which a defendant is sued for damages ends in a judgment for the defendant, you could say in one sense that the status quo hasn't changed.
The defendant didn't have to pay damages before the lawsuit ended and he doesn't have to pay damages after the lawsuit ended.
But we'd still understand that that's a final order because that put an end to that lawsuit. Similarly, if there were a temporary restraining order issued at the beginning of a case and a permanent injunction issued at the end of the case, there is a sense in which the status quo might not have changed; namely, that the party that's enjoined was prohibited from doing that act both before and after the final judgment.
But that doesn't change the fact that it is a final judgment. Counsel, on -- on -- on -- on that, the Sixth Circuit placed a great deal of stress, it seems, on the fact that the stay relief denial here was entered with -- with prejudice in its view. But what difference does that really make in a bankruptcy proceeding where orders are revisable all the time? So is -- is -- is that even a thing that -- that -- that -- that exists to say it's with -- with prejudice when it's not really with prejudice and -- and, if it really is without prejudice as a practical matter, what effect does that have on your argument here? That's a fair concern, Justice Gorsuch.
The -- the first answer to that concern is that, as a general matter, if the bankruptcy court says that it is denying a motion for stay relief, the creditor can't just come back and refile the motion. Now I grant there is an exception to that principle.
That exception is that under Rule 60(b), an analogous equitable doctrine, a court can revisit a determination that it's already made if changed circumstances make that original decision no longer equitable.
But that's not unique to the automatic stay. Any equitable decree, including those that we would all recognize as final judgments, can be reopened if the circumstances change. Does it really have to meet the standards of -- 60(b) is post-final judgment relief in normal civil litigation.
So we acknowledge there that there already is a final judgment and some extraordinary circumstances have to be met.
It's -- it's -- it's not just it's a new day and I see things differently. But, in the context of an ongoing bankruptcy proceeding, is the standard that high, is it as high as 60(b), or do you have any authority to that effect that could help me, or is it really just the bankruptcy judge's equitable sense? It is not just the bankruptcy judge's equitable sense.
And the best way to see that is in Section 362(e) where Congress repeatedly uses the word ""final"" to determine -- to refer to a bankruptcy judge's determination of a stay relief order. That -- that word can't be given meaning if the bankruptcy judge is simply allowed to come back and say, oh, I'm revisiting the final -- Do you have any authority to that effect? I'm not aware of a specific case of this Court or -- or a -- or a court of appeals upholding to that effect.
But I think the broader -- So, if that were right, though, that would -- that would also undercut -- and I apologize for -- this just follows from what you said, that if -- if it really is a matter of statute that compels this understanding of a -- of a stay relief denial, then whether the judge adorns it without prejudice, it's still really with prejudice. Any stay relief denials with prejudice, that follows from I think what you're saying, unless I'm missing something, which perhaps I am. No.
The statute provides for another type of denial of stay relief, what it labels a preliminary denial of stay relief, where the bankruptcy judge says something like, I'm denying relief because the debtor has a likelihood of success, but I want further proceedings.
And we don't contend that that would be final. Where the bankruptcy judge, however, says, I'm not contemplating further proceedings, this is a conclusive determination of stay relief -- So they're tied up in a bow.
The Sixth Circuit had it right.
It just used the wrong terms.
It's not with or without prejudice.
It's preliminary versus final. Yes, essentially. Mr. Suri, may I take you to a different place? Yes. In the last page of your brief, you refer to another circuit split. Apparently, there are some circuits that say, although you may bring an appeal immediately, you don't have to and you can wait until the end. And you suggest that we don't have to think about that question.
But, for me, that question is very tied up in all the policy concerns that we've been addressing here, the question of piecemeal appeals on the one hand versus the danger of undoing a bankruptcy proceeding on the other.
And -- and -- and those policy concerns for me have a lot of traction in this case.
I'm not sure what else really to go on. So how can we decide this case without deciding whether, when we say something is immediately appealable, we really mean it has to be appealed at that time? I'll start with this case and then turn to the broader issue raised by that split. So, in this case, regardless of whether as a legal matter one is required to appeal immediately rather than waiting until the end of the case, as a practical matter, as Justice Alito pointed out in an earlier question, the -- there won't be an opportunity for effective review at the end of the case anyway.
So, in this case, as a practical matter, there would likely be a requirement of taking an immediate appeal. Now, on the broader question, the issue essentially is: When a litigant takes an appeal from the final order at the end of the case rather than the final order at the end of an individual proceeding, is he allowed to raise, as a ground for reversal, some mistake made earlier in the proceedings or earlier in the case even if he had an opportunity to raise that earlier on and chose not to do so? The government hasn't taken a position on that.
But, if it would be helpful, I could lay out the arguments on both sides. On the one hand, in ordinary civil litigation, the rule is that you're allowed to raise any error made along the way in the case at the end when there's a final judgment, even if under the Collateral Order Doctrine or some special interlocutory appeal statute you had a right to take up the appeal earlier on and you chose not to do so. On the other hand, there are good reasons to think that bankruptcy might be different.
In bankruptcy, there is this concern about unscrambling the entire bankruptcy at the end because of some -- some error made along the way earlier on. So I -- I -- I think in this particular case the Court doesn't need to know the answer to that question in order to resolve whether an automatic stay -- You're suggesting then that this kind of relief, and motion to lift the stay, should never be considered revisitable at the end, but there may be other types of motions that should? I'm a little confused. We are highly skeptical that this type of order can be a basis for overturning a final judgment at the end of the whole bankruptcy case. We're not ruling out that there might be other types of orders that might be treated -- So an -- But what -- Go ahead. Why shouldn't we just decide this question? What -- what -- why doesn't the government have a position? Why isn't this ripe to decide it now? It seems very tied up in the whole thing. The Court shouldn't decide the question because no one's briefed the question.
And the government doesn't have a position on it because that was not part of the question presented.
It was not argued below. It was not argued as part of this case. When you very objectively and nicely laid out the competing positions, ""must"" certainly seemed a lot stronger than ""may."" That is a fair inference about where the government might be leaning on that question. (Laughter.) I'd -- I'd like to address the broader issue of what counts as a proceeding.
Essentially, when we're looking for a proceeding, we're looking for something that's a case within the case, something that could stand on its own outside the bankruptcy as an independent lawsuit. An example of that is the automatic stay adjudication.
Its equivalent outside bankruptcy would be a freestanding lawsuit about whether to enjoin the creditor from taking particular action against the debtor. And if that lawsuit ends in a permanent injunction, we'd all say that's a final judgment.
In the same way, when the stay relief proceeding ends in a final -- in -- stay relief order, that's a final order as well. In contrast, some of the examples that Justice Breyer raised would not stand alone as independent lawsuits.
Motion for summary judgment, for example, would not be its own lawsuit outside bankruptcy.
It would be part of another lawsuit.
So we wouldn't count that as a proceeding and we wouldn't count the order ending that as final. Why is lifting the stay separate? You could have a lawsuit outside bankruptcy that is analogous to a lift stay proceeding.
This is discussed in both of the conference -- both the House and Senate reports, which is just a lawsuit about whether a creditor should be enjoined from taking action against the debtor. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Lehman. Thank you. I'd like to begin with where the government ended and then move through some of the questions that were raised.
But we have here today the same arguments that the government presented last time. Last time, they took the same position that the Court should determine the finality of the order based on the proceeding.
And the only difference here in their briefing is, well, now it should be proceedings that are significant. The Court rejected that logic last time and it should reject that logic again this time. In this case, I would strongly disagree with my friend, who suggests that the stay has an equivalent proceeding outside. Unlike -- there -- there are things that are similar, such as the claims adjudication process.
That's a state law contract type of claim.
A DIP financing, a debtor-in-possession financing, which would be like a state court lien dispute, or a 363 sale where a state court complained to enjoin the sale or quiet title. But the idea that the stay has a parallel common law state cause of action is not something that is supported and is not something that there's any basis in the briefing to suggest. Now I'd like to go back to the questions raised -- raised by Justice Sotomayor about revisiting the automatic stay, and I'd like to address the four points that were given. First of all, the Respondents actually cited a case to the Court that changed that. On page 38 of their brief, the Gledhill case from the Tenth Circuit actually granted relief from stay and 10 months later then reconsidered and changed that.
Of course, we've granted other circuits where the result was the opposite, where the Court denied relief from stay and recognized that that might change later. Number two, there was a suggestion by my friend that it would require a new proceeding to -- to renew the automatic stay.
That's exactly true.
No different than in Bullard, where it required a new proceeding for a new plan confirmation, but the Court recognized that didn't change the analysis.
The fact that a new plan would have to be submitted under a new proceeding did not suddenly make the old proceeding an immediately appealable proceeding. Number three, the Respondent suggested that the motion to dismiss was not a proceeding, but, in fact, that is -- in fact, it's deemed a core proceeding under 3 -- 157(b). And then, finally, the government suggests in a rather surprising way that there's no basis to suggest that 60(b) -- or -- or that we have to have 60(b) as the standard for revisiting the automatic stay, with absolutely no authority to support that view other than the suggestion that 362(e) somehow imports a standard under 60(b). First of all, there have been no cases to suggest that.
In fact, the only cases that have been submitted to this Court suggest just the opposite. But the Respondent and the government continue to ignore the fact that 362(e) relates only to actions against the property.
And if the Court would look at the appendix to the government's brief, we did not include 362(e) because we did not believe it was relevant. But, on the government's brief at 4A, if you read 362(e)(1), the provision provides: ""Thirty days after a request under subsection (d) of this section for relief from the stay of any act against property of the estate under subsection (a) of this section."" Now, with respect to the questions about the permanent injunction, again, neither party has addressed the question that by definition under the statutory rules, 363 -- 362(c)(2)(C) says that the stay expires.
The word ""injunction"" is nowhere in 362. The stay expires on the discharge, which is what this Court recognized last term in Lorenzen.
And, by definition, it cannot be a final order because it is not a final injunction. It very well may act as a preliminary injunction under 1292(a), but that is something that this Court and Congress recognizes as an interlocutory appeal, not a final order. Now, with respect to the question about the scrambling of the eggs, the concern of the Court has been addressed by what exactly happened here. First of all, the creditors have been paid, as the Respondent represented, but they all got 100 cents on the dollar.
That was represented from day one.
And that was, in part, the basis for the bad faith claim that the bankruptcy was filed inappropriately. So the fact that the debtor -- that the creditors were paid 100 cents on -- I see my time is up. You can finish your thought. The fact that the -- the creditors received 100 cents on the dollar did not mean that this will be unscrambled, but that -- and they received 5.6 million dollars in cash since then, we believe would satisfy any problem that we have. Thank you very much. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1269, Rodriguez versus the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Reich. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is what body of law courts should apply to determine ownership of consolidated tax refunds. In our view, the answer to that question is straightforward. Courts should apply state law.
That's the body of law that virtually always governs property rights disputes in our federal system, and, here, the political branches have not displaced that traditional area of state power either by statute or by federal regulation. The FDIC takes a different approach, although exactly what that approach is has changed somewhat over the course of this litigation.
In the lower courts, the FDIC advocated a rule of federal common law known as the Bob Richards rule, which holds that ownership of a tax refund presumptively resides with the subsidiary whose losses gave rise to that refund.
That's the rule the FDIC has advocated for decades, and that's the rule the Tenth Circuit applied below. But, in this Court, the government has abandoned any defense of the Bob Richards rule, and as our opening brief explains, that rule fails every test this Court has established for the creation of federal common law and contravenes the tax laws themselves. Instead, the government advocates a brand-new rule, one that it's never pressed in the lower courts, and that, to our knowledge, no court has ever adopted.
But this rule suffers from an even more basic flaw than Bob Richards itself.
It simply assumes the answer to the very ownership question at issue. The government's argument starts from the premise that where a parent has agreed to pay its subsidiary the amount of a tax refund, the subsidiary has been vested with ""ultimate entitlement to the refund itself."" That assumption serves as the load-bearing pillar of the government's entire argument.
Yet, it has no basis in state law. The government disclaims any argument it's grounded in federal law, and it can't even find footing in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 1973 Bob Richards decision. Starting with state law, it's simply not the case that where a parent agrees to pay its subsidiary the amount of a refund, the subsidiary necessarily has any property rights in the refund itself.
Rather, there are two possible ways of characterizing that payment obligation, which have substantially different legal consequences. Before you proceed with that argument, you now said your question presented was about Bob Richards.
You say that the government has abandoned that position. The Tenth Circuit, on the other hand, the opinion is shot through with quotes from the contract and what the Tenth Circuit said, it -- it was examining the parties' agreement to determine whether the parent or sub gets this. So it seems that the Tenth Circuit, while it might have cited Bob Richards, was relying on contract interpretation. Why should we take up Bob Richards at all in this case? Because both sides agree that that's not what should be dispositive, and the Tenth Circuit said here we have a contract, calls for contract interpretation.
State law, contract interpretation.
The question presented, it seems, has now vanished from the case. I think the Bob Richards rule was critical to the Tenth Circuit's decision, and you can tell that both from what the Tenth Circuit said and what the Tenth Circuit did.
What the Tenth Circuit said on page 18a of the petition appendix is that Bob Richards ""clearly applies to this case and provides the general framework we must apply in resolving the parties' dispute."" It then went to say that what Bob Richards requires is that the -- the written terms of the contract unambiguously deviate from the Bob Richards rule.
So it -- it understood Bob Richards as establishing a clear statements rule, which is the understanding that the lower courts generally have of Bob Richards and that the FDIC itself has advocated for decades. And then, when the court went on to analyze the agreement, it didn't apply the ordinary rules of state agency law to determine whether an agency relationship had been created here.
It did what it said it was going to do, which is just look at the bare words of the agreement and see if they unambiguously departed from the Bob Richards rule. Excuse me.
May I -- because you're going to have to point to something in -- some words in the opinion that do that.
I -- I -- I read the opinion.
You're right, it said Bob Richards sets out the rule. But the first step of Bob Richards is: Does the contract tell us who has interim ownership? That's how I read the opinion.
Does state law trump a contract allocation of ownership? No.
State law sets the inquiry to determine whether the parties have vested equitable title in an entity -- No, no, no -- -- that does not -- -- answer my question.
If the contract said you're my agent, as clearly as that, would state law go any further? Would it change that statement? State law would not deem that sufficient to create an agency relationship. Ahh, that's what the fight's about, whether state law requires something in addition to that? Well, the -- the overarching fight is as to whether courts should apply the ordinary -- No, I don't want -- I don't an overarching fight.
I -- I want to know what state -- does state law say that state law trumps contract agreement? It doesn't say that it trumps the contract agreement, but I think -- All right.
So it doesn't say that.
Does it say we don't look to the contract to see who -- to establish if it does so unambiguously? It says you look to the contract to determine whether the parties have consented to enter an agency relationship. But -- All right.
So that's what state law says.
So in which ways did the Tenth Circuit err in looking at the contract to determine whether the parties consented to an agency relationship? The Tenth Circuit erred because it -- under state agency law, under the ordinary rules of state agency law, which the Tenth Circuit didn't cite or even purport to apply, the prerequisites for establishing the agency relationship are to -- are that the agents must be vested with both loyalty and control to the principal -- by the principal. The principal must have interim control over the agent.
That's the defining feature of an agency relationship. And the common law is equally clear that simply labeling someone an agent is not sufficient to establish a common law agency relationship.
That is in Section 1.02 of the Third Restatement, Section 1 of the Second Restatement -- Was this argued below? Yes, this was argued in exactly those terms below at every stage of the proceedings. So am I to assume you -- are you arguing that somehow, because of the Bob Richards rule, the court was not paying attention to what the contract did or didn't do? Yes.
What the -- the court expressly said the Bob Richards rule required was that the contract must unambiguously deviate from-- Tell me where the words -- where that -- where in the opinion you see those words. On page 18a of the petition appendix in the -- at -- at the end of the paragraph, it says that -- after it says Bob Richards outlines the general framework you must apply, it says that, therefore, as directed by Barnes and Bob Richards, we must look to the terms of the agreement and -- and see whether they unambiguously -- Well, it does say that. No, it doesn't.
It says taking into account Colorado case law.
You happened to leave those words out. Yes.
It looked to Colorado case law -- Well, that -- that's what it says. Only as to the question of how does one read a contract.
But it didn't -- No.
Ah.
How does one read a contract.
Okay.
They say here's what we'll do.
We'll look at the agreement, taking into account Colorado case law, and decide whether it unambiguously says how tax refunds are to be handled.
Then the next few pages, they do that. Then, at the end, they say, you know, it's ambiguous, but there's a rule, right, written down here that says in the case of ambiguity, you decide it in favor of the bank, the subsidiary.
And so we decide it in favor of the bank, and we conclude, since it must be construed in favor of the bank and the FDIC, the agreement must be read as creating only an agency relation between the parent and the bank. Okay.
I read that.
I thought, unless there's some Colorado law that says that that doesn't create an agency, they've said under Colorado law it creates an agency. And there is Colorado law that says that doesn't create an agency. Good.
Where is that in the briefs? That's in our -- that's in our brief -- Where? What page is it? I want to read it. In Part II of our brief, we go -- And what pages should I read? I -- I believe beginning on page 15 of our reply brief, we discuss the requirements -- Ah. -- of Colorado law. Starting on page 16 -- And do you say and, in fact, even though they said, taking into account Colorado law, we think this creates an agency relation; even though they said that, that was wrong as a matter of Colorado law? Yes.
That's -- that's precisely what we say -- Okay. -- that they don't look to -- Now, if they have made a mistake of Colorado law, I guess there is a group that could answer that question.
And they're not sitting in front of you. But -- but -- They're sitting in Denver. (Laughter.) Yes, Your Honor, but the issue here is not simply that it made a mistake of Colorado law.
It's that it didn't even purport to be applying the right body of Colorado law.
It said that it needed unambiguous evidence in the written terms of the agreement.
It doesn't cite to any Colorado cases as to agency.
And the word ""control,"" which is the clear prerequisite for agency in Colorado, doesn't appear once in its opinion. So its entire mode of analysis was dictated by what it understood to be the federal common law rule, which was a clear statement rule. Is it enough then for us to say in your view that the Bob Richards rule is not good law and then to send it back? I think that -- That's all we would say: Bob Richards.
Federal common law. We don't do that.
That's not a good rule. That's all we're going to say about this.
Send it back, as Justice Breyer says, and you can look at state law without any thumb on the scale provided by the Bob Richards rule? I think that's essentially correct, Your Honor.
The one amendment I'd make to that is I think the Court should clarify that in conducting, determining whether an agency or trust relationship exists, courts should apply the ordinary rules of state agency or trust law, not varied in any way because of the fact that a consolidated tax refund is available here. And I think that guidance is quite important because, if one looks at the lower court cases, even that's declined to apply the Bob Richards rule, there appears to be some confusion in the lower courts as to whether they should conduct a different analysis. For example, the Eleventh Circuit's Net Bank decision, although it rejects Bob Richards, it still doesn't purport to apply normal Georgia agency law.
It does -- it -- it just looked at the plain words of the agreement according to some undefined federal law standard. I guess the other thing we'd have to say as well is that the IRS regs don't speak to this question. Yes, Your Honor. The SG's -- the SG's new argument. And I think the SG's new argument, it all hinges on the -- on the notion that when a payment -- there's a payment obligation from parent to sub, entitlements to the refund has been vested in the sub, because what they say repeatedly throughout their brief is that the -- the sole office of the regulations in this context is not to alter the parties' underlying ownership rights under state law.
They say that at pages 18 to 19, 20 to 32 and 38.
And -- and we agree with that. That's -- that's correct.
And that has to be right because there's nothing in the federal tax regulations, let alone the Internal Revenue Code, that expresses any interest or concern with how ownership rights are allocated within an affiliated group.
They're simply silent on that question. And the government makes much of the word ""agent"" in the tax regulations, but that doesn't get them where they need to go for at least two reasons. One is that that word has universally been understood by the government itself and by every lower court as just a procedural designation that identifies the parent as the sole member of the group authorized to communicate with the IRS, not as vesting it with the obligations of a common law agent. And, in any event, second, even if it did carry some of its common law baggage, all the regulations say is that the parent is agent for the group as a whole, the affiliated group of which the parent itself is a member. So it doesn't tell you who within the group actually gets the refund.
You need to look to the parties' agreement as interpreted under state law to answer that question. And so that just brings you back to the underlying state law question: Do the parties agree the parent gets the refund and just those debts to the subsidiaries, or do the parties actually vest equitable title to the refund in -- in the subsidiaries? How do we write this? Justice Kavanaugh says we say no common law, Bob Richards rule.
But, if we read this opinion and don't think that they apply the Bob Richards rule to the interim ownership question, which is what's at issue here, you're just claiming a misapplication of Colorado law. Yeah. I don't -- I -- I will ask the Solicitor General whether they stand by -- they seem even under their test to create a common law rule under the two prongs. So I'll ask them whether creating any kind of federal common law is right or not and they can answer that question. But I don't know how I get to it when they haven't briefed that question, and I don't know how I get to it if I assume that what the -- the Circuit did was what I said, which was to look to the contract to see if it created an agency or debtor/creditor situation. Do I write an opinion that says when you look to the contract, that's what you do, and you apply just general state agency debtor/creditor law? I think that's exactly what the opinion should say, Your Honor.
And I just want to make a few points. So we don't need to reach Bob Richards, is what I keep saying. But the -- a -- a few points, Your Honor.
First, I think the government's failure to defend Bob Richards can't be a reason not to reach that question. That's -- Why? -- literally the question presented in this case. Usually, we need adversarial testing before we reach questions that are not implicated by the issues before us. Well, I do think the issue is implicated.
I would just take the Tenth Circuit at its word that it said Bob Richards clearly applies to this case and, for the reasons I mentioned, it understood that as establishing a clear statement rule. And I think -- Well, but, Mr. Reich, it didn't -- it said, you're exactly right, unambiguously, so it says there's a clear statement rule. But then, in its contract analysis, it obviously doesn't apply a clear statement because, in 10 pages of contract analysis, it says some provisions do this, and then, on the other hand, some provisions do that. And then, in the end, we're relying on a default provision in the contract itself.
So that's nobody's idea of a clear statement. So it doesn't seem as though that's what they were doing when they actually sat down to do the work of the opinion. I -- I -- I do think it was, Justice Kagan, in two ways.
One, I think that the fact that they invoked the -- the rule of construction in the contract was their way of determining that the contract did unambiguously address the question as a whole, that they thought the provisions were cut in both ways, but then the contract itself resolved that ambiguity clearly. And, moreover, the -- the -- the -- the way that Bob Richards was doing the work was in what question the court was looking at the contract to answer.
It was just looking at what the written terms of the agreement said, not what Colorado law actually requires for the creation of an agency relationship, an analysis that even the government doesn't really defend, because, in their brief, they themselves acknowledge that to create an agency relationship under Colorado law, you need control. They think a minimal level of control is sufficient, but -- which we don't think is correct, but even they think the court would have needed to do more under an actual normal agency analysis. So I think the mode of analysis was distorted by this notion that the -- only the words of the contract mattered. I suppose -- Why is it just in case we reach the question of federal common law, a matter which, when, I guess, I tried to study it, seems to have evaporated, what is -- why -- why isn't it common sense to say, look, we're talking here about three bank subs and a parent, and they get a tax refund, and the reason they get the tax refund is because of the bank.
They're the ones that lost the money. So mail them the money, IRS.
And in case there's something odd about it, there is an IRS rule.
And the IRS rule says, you know, it says that that parent, it says, is an agent, an agent for each member of the group.
And they describe it's the agent's, i.e., the parent's obligation, to collect the refund for the group. And that's one of the matters subject to the agency.
So that's what the IRS says.
So I am a naive judge who forgets his federal law course, and I look at that and I say: The IRS wants the money to go back to the -- to the bank.
The bank's the one responsible for the refund.
They are the ones that lost the money. And why shouldn't it go back to the bank, unless the parties want something different? And if they want something different, all they have to do is tell us in the contract. Now I -- I -- I know there must be a lot of law here that says don't do what seems to make sense. (Laughter.) But I'd like to know, in case we reach that issue, what is it? Yes, Your Honor.
I think that that intuition is undoubtedly what underlay the Ninth Circuit's decision.
And it wasn't much more than its feeling as to fairness that -- that guided it.
And I think there are two categories of flaws there. One is just the absence of any positive legal basis for codifying that intuition into law.
There's nothing in the statute or the regs that says that it's the subsidiaries, however sensible that could seem to a judge.
And -- and that, as you said, is Federal Law 101.
That means the courts can't create the rule themselves. But the second point is that even as to the sense of what's fair, I think the analysis that the Ninth Circuit conducted was overly simplistic on a number of levels. One is that the entire structure of the consolidated return regulations is to treat the affiliated group essentially as if it were a single entity and to merge its income and losses in ways that make it difficult and often contrary to the regulations to try to separate them out as attributable to one member or another.
For example, intercompany transactions, losses that are technically listed as one subsidiary's losses, could really be due to conduct of other members of the group. And, more broadly, the regulations don't -- are quite clear that payments of tax liability are entirely within this group's discretion to allocate.
So allocating refunds to a particular member decouples who -- who pays the tax liability from who gets the refund, which is itself quite unfair. And, finally, I think that the notion that federal law is necessary to achieve what seems like a fair result is itself flawed in that state law contains all the protections that the Bob Richards rule is purportedly designed to achieve.
State law contains numerous doctrines to prevent unjust enrichment.
There's constructive trust.
There's fiduciary duty. And many states have essentially the Bob Richards rule as rules of their own common law. In the FDIC v. FBOP decision that both parties cite, an Illinois court applied Illinois law which essentially has Bob Richards' rule at the state level.
And so does Oregon. So I think that there was no unfairness created by the application of that normal body of law, and states or the political branches are the ones entrusted with the authority to make these judgments as to fairness. I do want to go back to this point as to what the Tenth Circuit below said because I also think it's important to note that the government's principal reason for opposing cert in this case was that purportedly Bob Richards didn't play a role in the decision below.
We responded to the cert reply, and the Court granted the case nonetheless. And I think the government's refusal to defend the Bob Richards rule isn't a reason to not reach the question.
I -- I think that it's a sophisticated litigant; it certainly shouldn't be encouraged for declining to answer what's clearly the question presented. And -- and, in addition, there's many examples in this Court in which a difficult, if not impossible to defend, legal rule comes up to the Court.
The Respondent just doesn't defend it.
I think Justice Alito's opinion in Travelers Casualty and Surety Co. is a good example of this, actually quite a similar rule to this.
And the Court's practice in many of these cases is simply to deem the rule invalid, a rule that is manifestly indefensible, and -- and either not address or reject the government's other -- The problem is -- -- grounds for defending. -- we -- we have had no adversarial confrontation on -- on this issue, and we usually don't decide an abstract -- or a question disembodied from the case, that it has to be an actual controversy between the parties. And so you're -- you're -- you present a question; the other side says that's irrelevant to this case.
We have no one on the other side defending the rule. I think the government had every opportunity to defend this rule.
That was -- that was the question presented.
That's the question on which the Court granted cert. Just to put it another way, though, Mr. Reich, had the government come to us and said we no longer intend to defend the Bob Richards rule, I think we probably wouldn't have thought twice about just -- we would have said, well, then we need to appoint an amicus. I think it's a question as to why the government didn't do that in this case if it had no intention of defending the rule on which the Court granted cert. I also think it's notable that the government's brief attempts to cram its new rule into the Bob Richards decision, perhaps in recognition of the fact that that is the question on which the Court granted cert and it needed some basis for grounding its argument in that decision.
Of course, for the reasons we give, the rule it's advocating here has only passing resemblance to the actual Bob Richards rule applied by the lower courts or by the Tenth Circuit in this case. And so -- and so I don't think that the government's refusal to address the question can be a reason for the Court to allow a rule that is -- I think for the reasons we give in our opening brief, just fails every possible test for the creation of federal common law, something that is permitted only in the narrowest of circumstances. And there's the circuit split. And there is a circuit split, a 4-3 -- And the government benefits from this rule throughout the country. Absolutely.
It -- and -- and this is -- And it's manifestly indefensible. And this is a rule of no small -- So -- so their argument suggests, because they're not defending it.
Maybe they're going to tell me it is defensible, but -- Well, that'll be a surprise to us.
But I think the problem is that this rule is of massive economic significance. This refund is $4 million.
There's cases where these tax refunds go into 100 -- in the Downey case, 170 -- $370 million.
And these issues arise all the time in the bankruptcy courts. And it's often difficult for bankruptcy cases to even reach this Court because they moot out frequently because the bankruptcy proceeding concludes.
So I think in this case, where the Tenth Circuit said literally this rule clearly applies to this dispute and then said it -- set forth the analysis it applied, this is an opportunity for the Court to at last address a rule that has essentially abrogated state property rights for decades, with massive implications for creditors and for parties drafting these agreements, which should -- should know with clarity which law their agreements are going to be interpreted in light of. And if there are no further questions. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether the parties who made this contract intended the bank to be the equitable owner of the tax refund.
That question turns on the parties' contractual intent. To determine that intent, start with the facts that are undisputed.
First, the bank was the taxpayer in this consolidated group who paid the taxes and then generated the losses that earned this refund in the first place. UWBI is just a holding company.
It had zero taxable income in the relevant year.
It did nothing to earn this refund. Second, the parties here agree that, under the express terms of their contract, when the IRS paid the $4 million tax refund at issue in this case, the bank was entitled to receive that amount within 10 business days. So given those two undisputed facts, the refund is headed within 10 days to the bank and the bank is the taxpayer that generated the refund in the first place, ask yourself: Why would these parties have intended to make UWBI the equitable owner of the tax refund and left the bank as nothing more than an unsecured creditor? Especially when, if the parties had made that type of arrangement, they would very likely have violated the Federal Reserve Act. The answer is they didn't.
Every relevant provision of the contract shows that the parties intended to make the bank the owner of the refund and to make UWBI an agent.
First, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the parties specified that UWBI would act as an agent on behalf of the subsidiaries.
That's the language of their contract. Second, they said further that the essence of their agreement, the core logic of the agreement, was that the bank ought to be treated as a separate taxpayer and UWBI should be ""merely an intermediary with the IRS."" That type of language, ""agent,"" ""mere intermediary,"" that is exactly what you would expect to find in a contract if what the parties really wanted to get across was that when UWBI collects a tax refund like this one from the IRS, it does not acquire equitable title to it. The parties then went on to specify the duties that UWB had -- UWBI has as an agent. They said that if the bank incurs a loss, it -- Mr. Huston, two words you haven't used yet are Bob Richards. What -- what is your position on the extent to which that is implicated in this case? And what is your position on its viability? Your Honor, we think that Bob Richards -- as the case describes on its facts and as the courts have understood it, it provides a rule for determining who ends up with a tax refund where parties have not made a contract. I would urge the Court to look at page 17a of the Tenth Circuit's opinion.
This is where the court describes the Bob Richards rule. It's true, as my friend suggests, that the Tenth Circuit understood that Bob Richards applied to this case.
But, on the immediately preceding page of the opinion, the Tenth Circuit explained what the Bob Richards rule is.
What the Bob Richards rule is, is a rule where there is not an explicit agreement. The court went on to say, absent any differing agreement, it would apply Bob Richards. I'm sorry, now let's stop.
Assume this was that case.
Assume this agreement doesn't specify anything, all right? Can the Bob Richards rule stand? And why should it stand? Well, appreciating -- submitting respectfully that the court -- that would be a pure advisory opinion in the context of this case, Your Honor, I'm happy to answer the question.
I think the answer to the question is that where parties do not have a contract, the right way to determine who owns a tax refund is to look to state law. I think, as my friend suggests, the FBOP case is a -- So you are rejecting the Bob Richards rule? I -- there is -- we -- we certainly think -- Assuming -- Yes. -- you're right that it applies only when the parties don't have an agreement, you don't think it's right? I do not think that it is correct as a rule of federal common law.
And I think the -- the court in Bob Richards itself didn't say it was applying a rule of federal common law.
It said it was looking to unjust enrichment. Now, certainly, the Bob Richards opinion could have been more clear, and it's undoubtedly true that some courts -- All right, all right.
Let's just -- -- have subsequently understood Bob Richards -- -- let's just stop there because I think this is what the Chief Justice was trying to get at, and -- and Justice Sotomayor, too. If Bob Richards, as understood by the lower courts, as creating a federal common law rule, to require a clear statement in a contract before a contract will be enforced, contrary to existing state law, do we all agree, can we all agree on one thing, that's wrong? I agree that that rule of -- you would not put a thumb on the scale where the parties have a contract -- Okay. -- as we have always -- Is that a yes? All right.
That's a lot of words. Is that a yes? It's wrong? It's wrong.
We got that.
Okay. Did you say -- you said yes, though? He said it's wrong. So -- so, if that's the case, counsel -- (Laughter.) He said it's wrong. I'm not -- I'm not letting him off the hook so fast. No, I'm trying to keep him on. I'm -- I'm getting wheezy with this back and forth. (Laughter.) To be clear -- Let me just -- -- is -- is your answer to Justice Gorsuch's question yes or no? The answer to the question is that, where parties have made a contract, ownership of a tax refund is determined pursuant to the terms of the contract.
That's -- Pursuant to state law without any thumb on the scale by federal common law? Yes, with -- with -- Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Now, if that's the case, why shouldn't this Court say so? It seems like it would be of material benefit to the lower courts across the country that have operated under a different understanding for this Court to say so.
That's why we took cert in this case after all. I'm perfectly comfortable to the Court to write that opinion, Your Honor, but the last line of it has got to be that the judgment is affirmed -- (Laughter.) Well, no, what -- -- because this Court reviews judgments -- (Laughter.) -- this Court -- How about -- how about -- how about vacate and remand to decide under state law what the rule in this particular -- who cares about the refund in this case? All right.
I know you guys care terribly about it. I know your colleagues on the other side care terribly about it. But the Supreme Court of the United States is here to resolve circuit splits on questions of law.
We took this to decide the Bob Richards rule, whether it's a thing. And both sides seem to agree that it is not a thing, as understood by so many courts of appeals across the country.
Why shouldn't we put a period at the end of saying, both sides agree this is not a thing, go back and do it properly? Because the Court reviews judgments and not opinions, Your Honor.
And there's no error in the judgment.
The judge -- We vacate and remand for reconsideration under different -- new tests all the time, don't we? Not where the judgment -- We do that all the time. Yes, but not where the judgment has no error in it.
And you know that the judgment has no error in it because, as Justice Kagan explained, the operative part of the opinion, pages 18a to 27a, that's the portion of the Tenth Circuit's opinion where it gives the rule that supports its judgment. And it doesn't say one word about -- But it'll be easy -- -- federal common law or Bob Richards or anything. -- it'll be -- it'll be easy enough for the Tenth Circuit to say that on remand, to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's question, if Bob Richards did not put a thumb on the scale in its analysis. So you will end up getting the result you want from the Tenth Circuit if they truly did what you think they did. Well, I think, Your Honor, that -- But we don't know because they start out with this whole Bob Richards framework, and I don't think you can be sure.
And what's the problem with doing, as Justice Gorsuch said, vacating, remanding, and they can do it without Bob Richards? I think you do know, Your Honor, and I think it would be -- Well, if we do know, it'll be simple then, won't it? It -- it would be strange for the Court, I think, to vacate a decision and remand so that the Tenth Circuit can simply reinstate pages 18a to 27a -- Well, that -- -- of its opinion. -- they may or may not do that, though, knowing that Bob Richards does not, contrary to what they said in their opinion, provide the framework for the analysis. It -- but you have to understand, Your Honor, what the court meant by the framework of the analysis.
The framework includes the qualification that it applies only where the parties don't have a contract. Remember the judgment that the Tenth Circuit was reviewing.
The district court's judgment, the district court had said -- this is on page 49a to 50a of the petition appendix -- the court says: Thankfully, I don't have to wade into this messiness about the Bob Richards rule because these parties have a contract, the contract is ambiguous, and the contract itself supplies the way of resolving that ambiguity. Mr. Huston, may I ask you a question about another aspect of your answer to Justice Gorsuch? I think you said that the Bob Richards rule is wrong in the sense that it -- it puts a thumb on the scales when interpreting a contract.
Correct? A court should not apply a federal common law rule to -- to put a thumb on -- on the scale in the contract. Yeah.
How about if there is no contract at all? Do you think that there is a federal rule that decides the question then? Again, I think that question is not presented by this case.
But I -- no, generally not.
State law determines the rights and ownership of property, but the Tenth Circuit said that. So, in fact, the Bob Richards rule, whether it's a matter of contract interpretation or whether it's a default rule where no contract exists, as to both aspects of the Bob Richards rule, you're saying there's no place for such a rule in our law? Well, there's not a -- there's not a place for a rule of federal common law.
But, importantly, I think the Court should also recognize that Bob Richards then went on in an important part of its opinion to say don't make any -- don't have any misunderstanding about how the IRS tax regulations work in this case. And the suggestion that this is a new argument that we've sort of sprung on the Court for the first time is completely incorrect.
We cited Bob Richards for this proposition on page 13 of our brief to the Tenth Circuit. But the point here is the only reason why we're even entertaining the idea that UWBI would be the equitable owner of a tax refund that the group has allocated to the bank and that the bank earned is because the IRS regulations, for reasons of the IRS's own convenience, pay that refund to the parent. But what the regulations very much want to make clear, and what I hope this Court will use this case as an opportunity to make clear in its opinion, is that when the IRS makes that tax payment to the parent, it does not confer any equitable title. And the reason you know that's true is because the regulations use the term ""agent,"" which has a well-established common law meaning, and thereby draw on the general common law of agency. And I don't even take -- So does the regulate -- Well, now I -- -- my friends on the other side to dispute that. Go ahead. I guess I'm a little bit confused by this because that suggests that there is a federal rule that comes from the IRS regs that allocates this money in the absence of an agreement. I think, if you had asked Mr. Reich, Mr. Reich would say, no, that's state law that does that.
So that does -- does seem as though you're essentially saying that, in the absence of a contract, federal law controls. Your Honor, the regulations rebut the suggestion that corporate parents like UWBI have made all the time, that they ought to be viewed as the owner of a tax refund like this because they're in possession of it. And you can see this argument all over the Blue Brief.
Petitioner repeatedly says we are the party who is in possession of the refund.
That ought to count when you're figuring this out. The IRS regulations say, no, no, we do not mean to confer any equitable title.
We are for reasons of purely our own convenience giving you this refund. And so what I think it means is that you can't -- you can't put a thumb on the scale the other way in favor of corporate parents, which is what some corporate parents have repeatedly tried to ask for, by citing the IRS regulations. Bob Richards correctly interpreted the regulations not to do that.
It's a federal law -- Can I before -- I just don't want you to stop.
I like where you're going.
It's interesting and helpful. But I have two related questions. You're assuming throughout that Colorado law does give the money to the bank. Okay.
On pages 16 and 17 of their reply brief, they say no, Colorado law does not because Colorado law requires control by -- of the agent by the principal.
And that hasn't happened here.
Okay? So just writing the word ""affirmed"" is going to overlook what seems like a significant dispute. And the other thing that is bothering me, and I'll mention it once, is I tend to think words like ""federal common law"" are labels which have an uncertain meaning in some instances. And I guess if I had a cousin who was running the IRS, that cousin might think a very good tax principle is, when the IRS owes an entity money, you should pay it to the entity. And if, for example, the postman got ahold of the check and then went bankrupt, I don't think you'd say, if you were running the IRS -- but there may be no state law to the contrary -- the postman's bubble gum creditor gets some of that $4 million. All right? So I'm worried about the term.
I'm worried about the implications of what we write.
But maybe there is an argument about Colorado law here.
Although you're certain there isn't, they're certain there is. And so what do we do? Your Honor, let me address all the questions in one -- in one answer. Petitioner has not identified a single case under Colorado law in which parties said we want the nature of our relationship to be an agency, and then a court came back and then said, oh, no, you have not created an agency because you haven't provided the specific forms of interim control that that agency relationship requires.
It's supposed to be easy to create an agency relationship. Think about an example where my coworkers appoint me as their agent to go to the deli and pick up lunch.
They say, Michael, you will be our agent.
The order at the deli will be placed in your name.
Bring us back the sandwiches and bring us back the change, too. When I'm on my way back to the office, if I suddenly declare bankruptcy, everyone understands that the sandwiches and the change are the property of my coworkers.
They don't become part of my bankruptcy estate. And it doesn't matter that my colleagues didn't specify here is the specific route you have to take from the deli back to the office.
And it doesn't matter that they didn't specifically say that I was required to keep each of my six colleagues' change in a separate envelope. In fact, the Restatement at Section 8.12, the comment C, in the Third Restatement is clear that parties are free to waive the normal segregation obligation if they don't particularly care about it.
And you can understand why closely affiliated parties like these would have wanted to say: You know, for 10 days, which is the only interim period that we're talking about, we're just not that especially concerned about what UWBI does. But what you're talking about, you're talking about general agency law, which is to say you're talking about state law. Absolutely, Your Honor. That's right.
And that's -- that's -- but it's also a -- You want us to take a decision of state law? We want to -- we want you to -- the judgment rests on the contract.
We think that judgment is absolutely correct, there's no error in it, and that judgment should be affirmed. And another reason that you know that this judgment is correct is that when this particular group, which contains an insured depository institution, sat down to write their contract, their federal regulator had told them that, pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act, they would not be permitted to engage in a contract like the one that Petitioner advocates. So -- Well, one of the things I -- I took from what you said a few minutes ago, but maybe this isn't what you meant, was that you want federal law to be involved in this to the extent of not having the actions taken by the IRS in mailing the check figure at all in the determination of ownership under state law. You want the federal government's participation to be completely neutral.
Did I misinterpret that? That's basically correct, Your Honor.
I -- I just -- I would phrase it slightly differently.
The federal regulations bar a corporate parent like UWI -- UWBI from claiming any equitable entitlement to this refund by virtue of the mere fact that it has possession. Do we know, by the way -- It has that possession as an agent. -- on this -- it has put the question in my mind.
It may have an obvious answer.
But how do we know there is a Bob Richards rule? Now how do we know it isn't like phlogiston? How do we know it really exists? Because it could be every time a court has mentioned Bob Richards' rule, what they're doing is going to exactly where they would go if they simply looked to state law, unless, of course, it's in the contract. Now do we know there is a problem? I mean, which is the case that would be most obvious that a court invoked the Bob Richards rule but went to a result that was different than what you'd reach -- reach if you just read the contract under state law? Your Honor, I think, generally speaking, there aren't very many of them.
And that's why when these contracts -- when parties -- Name me one. I -- I -- I'm not sure that there is one.
I think -- in fairness, I think the question would be better directed to -- to my friend, but I think that what these courts -- the courts that have looked at these things have said where there's a contract, we should generally speaking apply -- we, in fact, always were going to apply the contract.
Every court of appeals recognizes that where the parties have a contract, you apply the contract. And then the question is -- but -- and this is the important part, and, again, I think this goes to one of your other -- Your Honor's other questions.
I really hope that the Court's opinion will make clear in this case that when parties set out to determine equitable ownership of a tax refund, using words like ""agent"" and ""mere intermediary"" in your contract is a perfectly sensible way, indeed, I think it's the best way, to make clear that the party who holds bare title, who collects the refund from the IRS, does not acquire equitable ownership of it. Petitioner has no sensible explanation for what that language is doing in this contract if not to -- In your -- -- make clear -- -- in your answer to Justice Alito where you said it should be affirmed, should it be affirmed on the basis of the IRS reg or affirmed on the basis of state law? It should be affirmed on the basis of the contract, Your Honor, the judgment of -- Contract as interpreted? Under state law.
With the caveat that -- Does the IRS reg play any role therefore? It -- it plays a role in this limited sense.
It -- Let me -- let me -- Yes. -- ask you this way: If the IRS reg leads you to a different answer, as you described it, than state law does, what happens? It -- it would not.
That would not -- the IRS reg does not override state law.
That's not how it would -- Okay.
So it all -- -- it precludes -- Well, when you said -- you said in your brief federal law provides relevant back ground for construing the contract, what did you mean? We mean that a Petitioner, a party like Petitioner, UWI -- UWBI, cannot come into court and say we -- we have a good claim to being the equitable owner of this refund because we're in possession. After all, the IRS regulations, they paid us. That's how you know we're the owner of it. The IRS regulations do not allow a corporate parent to make that type of argument. And that's what -- So -- So they do play a role. They don't override state law, but -- But maybe -- you know, maybe state law would say if you are in possession, then you are the owner. Well, state law certainly does not say that, Your Honor.
I mean, it's emphatically the case that the Restatement does not say that mere possession coupled with something like, you know, the absence of a specific description of interim control leads to equitable ownership. Indeed, as I said, it's supposed to be easy to create -- Well, then it just seems -- That's -- -- as though it's a matter of state law.
What does -- It is -- -- what does federal law have to do with it? It is ultimately, at the end of the day, a matter of state law.
And, more specifically here, it's a part -- it's a matter of state contract law. And on that question of state law, Justice Breyer was pointing out that there's disagreement about -- on page 16 and 17, about what the state law is, and the bankruptcy court had a different view, correct? That's right.
It had a different view, an incorrect view. So it had a different view on state law. Yes. So, if it is purely a question of state law and there's been disagreement here and there's disagreement between the bankruptcy court, which is expert in these matters, and the district court and the Tenth Circuit, shouldn't we remand for the state law question to be sorted out? You -- you've implied -- just to follow up on this, you've implied that the state law question is so obvious.
But we have the bankruptcy court going the other way on it. Well, it's particular -- it's overwhelmingly obvious here because these parties have a contract that resolves any ambiguity in favor of the bank. So to whatever extent there is a fight about what you would do where there's not a contract or if a contract -- you know, in a different case, if the contract were ambiguous, again, I -- I think you can just read the Restatement and understand that it's supposed to be easy for parties to create an agency relationship, but to whatever extent you have doubts about, you know, how -- what these parties wanted for their contract, you know that they wanted an agency relationship because they went out of their way to write an ambiguity-resolving provision in favor of the bank.
And they did that, again, because their federal regulator had told them to do that.
And this is important to the FDIC. It would be very troubling if the Court made a rule that said, you know, it's actually really quite difficult for parties to create an agency relationship to specify that the party that generated the refund has equitable title to it.
You have to engage in this onerous analysis and you have to write down a lot of provisions about control -- Would it be a problem for the FDIC if we just said it's a matter of state law? Well, Your Honor, I would -- I think the Court should make clear that parties are entitled to rely on the statement that their federal regulator has given them about how they're supposed to handle contracts exactly like this one. And what the federal banking regulators have instructed is write your contract to make clear that you are entering an agency relationship.
And, again, parties who have made these contracts have relied on that instruction. So, if this Court goes back and says, you know, it's all just a question of state law, I don't think that that gives adequate weight to what the regulators are instructing insured depository institutions. But I thought you just said to Justice Kagan it is a matter of state law. Well, it's a matter of state -- it is, it is, in the sense that, at the end of the day, you know, these parties have to write a contract. What I am saying is that the federal regulators in this area have told groups that have insured depository institutions that they should enter an agency relationship.
They're required to by Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.
Those are the affiliate transaction rules. And it would be -- so I think the Court should -- should say that it is easy for parties to enter that type of agency relationship.
And, in particular, it suffices to say, in this group, for our purposes, what we want to do is have UWBI collect a tax refund as our agent. Remember that the -- the parties said that when the bank incurs a loss, it is entitled to receive a refund equal to what it would have received if it had filed as a separate taxpayer. If the bank had been a separate taxpayer, it would have been the owner of this tax refund, not merely an unsecured creditor. And, again, there's just no reason, there's no one who benefits from the arrangement that Petitioner suggests, this debtor/creditor relationship, in addition to the fact that it would very likely violate federal law. Think about the parties when they're designing this agreement.
They know that the bank is the taxpayer that generated it.
They know that they want the refund to go within 10 days to the bank. Who benefits from structuring the relationship as a debtor/creditor relationship for those 10 days? The only conceivable entity is the parent company's creditors in a hypothetical future bankruptcy.
And there's no way that this group was seeking to protect them and thereby endanger the bank's refund. So, at the end of the day, it is a question of state law, we agree, but we think that the judgment that is under review in this Court rested entirely on state law, the operative part of the opinion is, again, pages 18a to 27a. The entirety of that section has nothing to do with federal common law or federal law at all.
And that's, again, because the judgment that the Tenth Circuit was reviewing was the one from the district court, which itself had focused on resolving the case based on the parties' agreement. So I hope that, again, the Court will use the case as an opportunity to make clear that the tax regulations don't give a corporate parent any claim to equitable title, first; and, second, that parties are free to allocate questions of tax refunds -- You seem to be saying -- -- and they can do it with words like ""agent."" But you seem -- I'm -- I'm not quite sure what you're arguing, because you seem to be saying the opposite. You're saying the IRS payment should be seen as an agency payment only.
That goes back to Justice Kagan's point, which is you're not taking a position either way. The IRS regulations do not override state law, Your Honor.
They bar a corporate parent like -- But they don't create a state law agency relationship? Well, they -- no, they -- I don't -- that's -- I think they don't, that's right, but what they do do is they bar a corporate parent like UWBI from attempting to invoke its possession as a basis for its equitable ownership. That -- that -- that -- They can't make that argument. I'm sorry, counsel.
It makes no sense.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law, I was taught as a child, even before I was a lawyer.
So possession has some state law consequences. But -- but this is -- Whether you want to bar them or not, you can't do that unless you explicitly state that. Your Honor, they do explicitly state it.
And the way that they do it is they use the general common law term like agent. And that is exactly the term that you would use to make clear that, when UWBI collects a tax refund from the IRS, it doesn't acquire equitable title to it.
And you can understand why the parties to this group, and the parties to a lot of groups that have these consolidated filing agreements said, you know, we want to make clear that when UWBI goes to the IRS and it just receives the refund for reasons of the IRS's own convenience, that mere fact, that mere possession does not in this case give UWBI any claim to equitable title. And the way that the regulations do that is by saying, agent, we, in this group, know that our federal banking regulators have instructed us to describe our relationship as agency in order to fulfill our legal obligations. And for all those reasons, we are going to say that UWBI in this group is an agent.
It's a mere intermediary. Again, if you wanted to design the debtor/creditor relationship that Petitioner suggests, and you went to a lawyer and said draw that up for me, I think what that lawyer would say is the one thing you should not say in your agreement is that the corporate parent is going to be the agent or the mere intermediary of the bank. May -- That makes no sense. May I ask, Mr. -- or maybe this isn't a question.
Maybe this is more in the realm of making a comment. (Laughter.) And this is not on you, Mr. Huston.
You have lots of bosses in the Solicitor General's Office.
But if you had said to the Court that you did not intend to defend Bob Richards, as everybody understands that rule, and if you had said to the Court that you did not intend to state a position on the only question presented in the case, I don't exactly know what we would have done, but I will tell you that there is a pretty good probability that we would have thought that that was an appropriate place to appoint an amicus. So I guess I -- I -- to the extent that this is a question, I want to know how you think we should deal with this issue? Your Honor, I think we told the Court in our brief in opposition that, contrary to Petitioner's representation, the Bob Richards rule actually wasn't doing the work in this case that Petitioner would like it to. There is some disagreement about what the Bob Richards rule does.
But everybody agrees that that only happens in a case where the parties don't have a contract.
And we said this -- But you did -- -- on page 16 of -- But you did say -- -- our brief in opposition. You did say in your brief, and this is in pages 31 and 32, ""Bob Richards supports the distinct proposition that the parent's role in interacting with the IRS on behalf of the affiliated group does not give the parent temporary equitable title to the refund."" So you are bringing up Bob Richards as in support of your position that there's -- that the temporary possession doesn't create the equitable title. That's correct, Your Honor, but that -- that aspect of Bob Richards is an interpretation of the federal tax regulations.
It's not a rule of federal common law.
And it's a correct interpretation of the federal tax regulations. Justice Kagan, just to return to my answer to your question, again, I think on page 16 of our brief in opposition we made clear the very limited work that we think Bob Richards does in the lower courts and in this case. And we said that where the parties have a contract, you resolve ownership under the contract.
And that is our core submission here. So I -- I think, again, it's important to understand what the regulations do and do not do and the fact that the regulations prevent Petitioner from making some of the arguments it has tried to make in this case, but at the end of the day it would be very, very difficult, I think, for this Court to look at this contract and say that, where the parties wrote an ambiguity-resolving provision in favor of the bank, where they specified that UWBI should be a mere intermediary, the parties, nevertheless, unambiguously intended to make UWBI the equitable owner of this refund. Petitioner agrees that he cannot prevail in this case unless he is unambiguously correct.
And the reason for that is not because of a rule of federal common law.
It's because that's the clause that the parties wrote into their agreement. That was the basis of the judgment below.
There's no error in that judgment.
And so that's why at the end of the day this Court should affirm. I also think, as I stated, that I hope the Court will clarify what the regulations do, and make clear that it's easy for parties to specify that a party like the bank who earned the refund is the owner of it. A perfectly sensible way to do that is to say we want to make UWBI the agent.
We want to make them a mere intermediary. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Reich. I think I'll start by what my friends conceded at the podium, which is that on the sole question on which this Court granted certiori, is the Bob Richards rule valid, the answer is no, that that rule is not a valid rule of federal common law and that courts should not apply it. Therefore, the Tenth Circuit erred in saying that Bob Richards clearly applies to this case and sets forth the framework that must govern the parties' disputes. And, Justice Kavanaugh, you're exactly right.
This is a -- the -- the lower courts need clarity on this question.
It's a subject of a significant circuit split of great economic significance every day. The -- the -- my friend argued that this decision didn't play a role, that Bob Richards didn't play a role in the decision below, despite what it said, because everyone ostensibly agrees that where there's an agreement Bob Richards has no effect. That's not the FDIC's position in the lower courts and that's not what the Tenth Circuit said.
Indeed, in its brief in opposition in this case, on page 16, it said that Bob Richards governs unless an agreement clearly addresses the ownership of tax liability and departs from that rule. And in its brief in the AmFin case, which we cite in our cert reply, the government's position, which has been consistent for decades, is that an agreement must contain specific language that conclusively disavows the Bob Richards rule in order to depart from this presumption. So it's -- it's not a rule that vanishes whenever there's an agreement.
It's a rule that all the lower courts understand as a clear statement rule which puts a very heavy federal thumb on the scale in favor of particular allocation of liability.
And that's the role it played in the decision below. My friend says that the sole role that the regulations ostensibly play in this area is clarifying that a party can't claim a federal law entitlement to a refund just because it's been paid to them.
That -- that is a response to a straw man.
That's nobody's argument. Our argument is states' law governs without any federal law preference one way or the other.
And -- Well, I don't want to interrupt your rebuttal but I didn't quite understand his point to be that, that -- that -- I thought his point was that the fact that the IRS for convenience purposes chooses to pay it to the parent is not -- cannot be taken as a factor under state law. I -- I -- Do you disagree with that? We do disagree with that. And we don't think that the regulations say anything to that effect.
The regulations say the refund is paid directly to and in the name of the parent.
And at that point the government's liability is discharged. The regulations express no interest or concern with how state law allocates the refund after that. I will note in their brief they make this point many times, that parties can't claim a federal law entitlement by virtue of that. But the critical point is that others -- Do you think that the -- that the federal government could not make that -- could not take that position? I think it's entirely within the federal government's power to at least dictate a default rule.
And if the IRS enacted a regulation to that effect, we would not argue that's outside of its power.
And, indeed, to some extent they have done so in cases where they've said that refunds should be directed to subsidiaries, in Section 16642-7 and 78 of the IRS regulations. I -- But the -- I apologize for interrupting your rebuttal as well, but just to follow up on Justice Alito's question, do we even need to resolve this? I mean, we took this case to decide the Bob Richards rule. Now we're being asked to address the subsidiary question about the effect of an IRS regulation or the non-effect of it.
Do we need to -- do we need to do that? No, Your Honor.
And I think my friend's suggestion that this argument was raised on page 13 of the Tenth Circuit brief is just not correct.
That -- that -- that page of that brief just quotes the ordinary Bob Richards rule without any suggestion of this new argument about what the regulations mean. And -- and my friend also made this argument that it would seem absurd under state law to not allow the term agents to do all the work of establishing an agency relationship. This is Black Letter common law represented in the third restatement, the second restatement. It's illustration two in the entire second restatement, is making the point that calling something an agency agree -- agree -- an agency does not establish an agency relationship.
And the Colorado Supreme Court has said many times that words are not enough, in the City of Aurora case and in the Moses case.
And this doesn't mean it's hard in any way to assign a refund to the subsidiary. The easiest way to do so is in the government's -- in the banking regulators guidance, their 2014 addendum to their policy statement, which is cited on page 9 of the government's brief, it provides model language that parties can use to achieve the result it's advocating here, which establishes a trust relationship, which is very easy to establish under state law, requires nothing more than designating someone a trustee and requiring funds to be held to -- to -- to be clearly set aside for the subsidiary. And we think that model language is perfectly sufficient to achieve this result. An agency relationship is harder to create.
It requires interim control.
And -- and that's been the law in almost every state and in Colorado for a long time. I -- I -- I'd like to -- Maybe I don't hate interrupting as much, but -- (Laughter.) -- it seems I don't know exactly what you're seeking.
If I say you're my agent, you get this money, pay it over to me in ten days, do I have to tell them how to pay it over to me? Do I have to tell them that I have the ability to redirect payment to someone else? I have to do all those things under Colorado law? May I finish? Briefly. To establish an agency under the common law, the -- the subsidiary would at least need to reserve the right to direct how the subsidiary fills out -- how the parent fills out -- fulfills that task either by having authority to direct it to seek the refund in the first place or direct how it handles the refund once it's received. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1233, Romag Fasteners versus Fossil, Inc. Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act authorizes courts to remedy trademark violations by awarding infringers profits subject to the principles of equity.
The question presented here is whether the -- this phrase ""principles of equity"" requires trademark owners to prove willfulness as an absolute precondition to profit awards. The answer is no for three reasons: First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" signifies a multifactor analysis where no one factor is controlling. Second, the phrase -- excuse me.
The statutory text and structure supersede any settled willfulness requirement. And, third, there was no such settled background willfulness requirement. First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" refers to the familiar equitable principles that courts have long applied in determining whether to award profits in trademark cases.
A defendant's culpability is a weighty factor, but it should not be controlling.
Other traditional equitable factors are also important to further the landmark -- the Lanham Act's purposes to protect consumers and trademark owners' goodwill. Such traditional factors include whether other relief adequately compensates the plaintiff and whether the defendant is enriched by his violation of law. And these factors can all exist along a spectrum.
For instance, culpability can range from fraudulent to innocent and everything in between, including callous disregard and negligence.
So in a case where a defendant is completely innocent, courts should require a greater showing of other factors before awarding profits. Conversely, greater culpability justifies a profit award that deters future infringement.
And courts can be trusted to use their discretion to balance the equities for the cases in between.
The statute also requires the amount of any award to be compensatory and not a penalty, and just, according to the circumstances. Second, even assuming a settled willfulness requirement before the Lanham Act, the statutory text and structure reflect a congressional intent to supersede it.
From the Act's inception, i.e., from 1946, Congress has expressly distinguished and protected defendants and which defendants from awards of monetary relief based on a heightened mental state. Today the Lanham Act contains eight provisions tying monetary relief to a heightened mental state.
That's -- that's a lot of provisions.
The provision that dictates monetary relief, Section 117(a), is the provision that controls this case.
That case -- that provision, excuse me, requires a willful violation for trademark dilution under 1125(c), but no such mental state requirement appears for infringement violations under Section 1125(a) or any other cause of action under the Lanham Act. We think the inference is particularly strong that the omission of a willfulness requirement is intentional.
The same Congress in 1999 that amended the statute to add a willfulness requirement for trademark dilution cases under subsection (c) affirmatively distinguished this type of infringement case under subsection (a) because the amendment simultaneously struck out the word ""violation"" of Sections 1125(a) and then reinserted that same phrase, violation of subsection (a), and then added a willful infringement -- Ms. Blatt, could you concentrate on the word ""equity""? Do you think equity would sustain an award for innocent or good-faith infringement without a more culpable state of mind? Because there's a wide swath of behavior between truly innocent, truly good faith, and willful.
There could be reckless.
There could be callous disregard. Would equity consonance an award for negligence or good faith? Yes.
And as I said in the earlier -- But how? -- the earlier case, you would need a greater showing of the other purposes or the other equitable factors.
And those are two.
The first and foremost is whether if no other relief could adequately compensate the plaintiff. And even in a case of a completely innocent defendant, damages are notoriously hard to prove.
They're almost never recovered in trademark cases.
And they're particularly impossible to prove in component cases. There's other equitable factor -- so that's one, is that even a dollar, that they would rule that out in an innocent case, even though there's no other relief, but the second equitable factor is the basic principle of equity, which is just you don't get to hold on to profits that don't correctly belong to you if you violated the law to get them. And, again, here, let's just take the example, the other side says, at a minimum, we concede $900.
That's their argument.
All we're entitled to for profits is $900.
Their view is we can't even get $900 unless you show willfulness, and you, otherwise, you just walk away with nothing. Now, they say that there's the statutory damages, you can always opt for the $200,000 statutory damages, which is certainly nice, but the problem with that is multifold. One is that it's not even available unless the mark is both registered and counterfeit, so countless trademark plaintiffs aren't even eligible for this. And, second, it's supposed to be a floor and an alternative.
So in a hypothetical case, that is our position.
Now, in this case we have a little more.
The parties on a remand have lots of arguments why the amount should be closer to 900.
We have arguments why it should be higher because this is not only just a small business, but the manufacturer set up its operations in China, where counterfeiting is rampant and there's no incentive -- if all you have to pay is nothing, there's just really not that much incentive to prevent counterfeiting. So those would be the arguments on remand.
And let me just say, at the common law, we did cite examples, they're not voluminous, but there are examples, both pre-Lanham Act and post-Lanham Act, where courts in cases of innocent infringement did award profits.
It's just not routine. Pre- -- pre-Lanham Act, that's not much, right? Three? Well, sure.
Sure, three's a lot when -- Pre- -- pre-Lanham Act, I said. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
So the one of them was the Mishawaka. Yes. And that was a Supreme Court case. Right. You didn't award profits, but the -- the district court did.
The second was the Oakes case, which is, I don't know, 1888.
It was from Alabama.
Nothing wrong with Alabama.
It counts as a case. (Laughter.) So -- and then we had a third case that -- the third case is Prest-O-Lite, and that's from New Jersey.
So I don't know why these cases don't count just because there are other cases that say we're going to award profits. So if you just look at the -- the common law, and the most significant aspect of the common law, of course, is that the very cases from the common law that articulate a willfulness requirement say in the very same sentence: But there was some conflict in the decision. So a conflict is a conflict is a conflict.
It's not a -- the kind of clear rule that you could say would always rule it out. How is willfulness defined? I mean, here the jury found callous disregard, but not willfulness.
Did the judge charge on what those terms meant? Yes.
Yes.
So the -- the charge on willfulness was -- it includes intentional conduct and willful blindness, which is awareness of a high probability of harm and you take affirmative steps to avoid learning about it. Callous disregard is a rubric of willfulness, but it doesn't rise to either of those levels.
It's closer on the recklessness spectrum.
So generally in your case law, willfulness is defined usually to include reckless, but here the parties, meaning our side, did not object to recklessness being taken out so that the jury was only instructed on willfulness and not recklessness. Is it -- But they're similar because callous disregard under Second Circuit case law was a function of willfulness, it just wasn't willful blindness. I can't work out, there's maybe an obvious answer to this that I've missed, but -- but in reading the statute, I thought, well, suppose you do have to have willfulness in order to get profits, and there would be a certain number of cases you don't get profits, right, okay.
Think of those cases. Then I see this sentence in 1117, it says, ""if the court shall find that the amount of recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive, the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case."" So if you did have to have willfulness, but all these things like in China and so forth were -- were -- were right there in the case, the -- the -- the court could give the -- the -- the Plaintiff more money, couldn't they, under that sentence? Maybe I don't understand the question.
The other side is no, we don't get any money -- In this case -- -- absent willfulness. -- they think that, but I want to know why.
And even if we were arguing about willfulness, so I say suppose they're right that willfulness does apply, you think it doesn't apply, right? Right. Okay.
But suppose they win.
Suppose you produce your instance which you just did, that in China they'll go around and, dah-dah-dah, and we won't be able to get any significant amount of money, why wouldn't you say to the judge: Read that sentence, Judge, they weren't willful, we agree but we're giving you reasons why in this case we should get more relief. Well, if you're saying you should read willfulness into the -- No, I'm not -- I'm saying -- No -- -- it's what you do, yeah. Yeah, so if your view is that you read it into it but then courts can read it out -- They did not say they can read it out.
They can say it's there, they weren't willful but we have a sentence here which gives us total discretion in the interest of justice to give the damages that we think are just and fair. So nobody is going to be hurt by accepting their side.
All it's going to do is give this -- more discretion to the district court to award as much money or as little as he thinks is fair. So -- Now why isn't that what that sentence does? I just want to -- I think this sentence -- -- know what it does. -- helps us.
Here's just my concerns.
Six circuits read that sentence as saying they cannot award profits if willfulness is not shown. No matter how appealing the case? Yes, that's why we're here on a petition to -- Has anybody argued about this sentence? Yes. In our brief -- in your brief you put that? Yes. Good.
Where -- what -- where -- I better read it. (Laughter.) I mean, it's -- it's in the intro and it's in the -- Fine.
Will you just tell me.
I obviously, you know, sometimes I read these fast. I don't know the page.
I mean, it's definitely -- the gestalt of the cases going our way is, look, we'd like to see willfulness, but if we don't see it, it's not controlling, and it's just one of these weighty factors but there's always been a list of traditional factors, before the Lanham Act and after he Lanham Act.
The culpability is one and the two that I've ever -- the two that I mentioned are the other ones that are critical, whether there's some form of compensation and whether there's just a sense of unjust enrichment.
But yes, you can go down or above. But I think that we use that sentence to say, there's no harm, there's no risk of a windfall because no matter where you come up with your award, the Court can always reduce it or raise it, depending on the circumstances.
So I don't -- maybe I just don't understand your question. Well, I was trying to understand the significance of the case.
And you're saying, unless we read willfulness out of it, there are going to be some terrible cases where, in fact, the -- the infringer did it totally by accident, totally by accident.
He had a dream with this -- this symbol appeared to him and he put it on his thing not knowing that somebody else had it, a total accident. So -- Now, you say still this is very bad because don't you know, that the trademark is owned by some widows and orphans and terribly suffering people and -- and -- and you should certainly give them some money or goodness knows what'll happen, you know -- Right, so -- -- very appealing case that you're worried about, therefore you say -- Yeah. -- read willfulness out of it.
I say why do you need to do that? Why not just point to the sentence? So we're not reading it out.
We're just saying that it's not a precondition in step one.
It is -- no question, I mean, our view is that it's a sliding scale, all of these traditional equitable factors are appropriate and then when you get to the amount, you can adjust it. So it just would seem odd to write an opinion that says, even though it's not in the statute, even though it wasn't a clearly stated rule, just because the other side asked for it, we want to read it in because we want to be nice to the respondent.
I don't think that's a good way to write an opinion. Ms. -- Ms. Blatt, your -- your lead argument, of course, is the phrase willful violation under Section 1125(c) and the willfulness is not -- doesn't appear in the other part, but 1125(c) includes willfulness, it's about willfulness. So, and I gather this is the argument on the other side, saying willful violation under -- that's kind of like just the label, this is what it is.
And so when you just stick the label in, it's about a willful violation, that shouldn't have the same sort of exprecionias -- whatever it is, argue -- impact as you suggest. Right.
And that's a -- that's a fair argument.
The argument is it is just mirroring the cause of action.
And so that just begs the question of why did they even need to put willfulness in the trademark dilution as a protection against profits and damages in the first place.
That's our whole argument about it appearing eight times. The underlying 1125(c), when it was passed, says you need a willful violation for a cause of action to collect monetary relief.
And our point is simply it is not the most natural inference or the most natural inference is if they didn't think that there was already an omnibus willfulness requirement for all profit awards because they took such care in 1125(c), in the statutory damages, and in the treble damages and profits.
They basically say you can't get monetary relief, damages, and profits absent these heightened scienter.
And the other side says: Well, but those apply to damages too. And our point is, sure, but it seems odd that Congress went out of its way to protect from the beginning in 1125(c) against profits when, under their view you didn't need it because it was already read into the statute as a principle of equity in all cases. So, in other words, take section -- the -- the -- the original Trademark Act of -- the original 1946 act, that was 1114, which is the violation for registered trademarks.
So it's very similar, like 1125(c), it says, here's going to be a class of cases where we don't want monetary relief. So innocent printers and innocent publishers, no damages, no profits.
And any defendant who reprints -- or excuse me, who prints an infringe mark without knowing that the infringement was intended to confuse, can't get profits or damages. The other side says, well, it's not superfluous because it at least applies to damages.
And our point is, well, it's at least superfluous as to profits.
It's that Congress is taking its care in eight provisions to keep saying no profits here, no profits there, no profits left and right, based under these heightened scienter. So whatever you think principles of equity means, the one thing it can't mean is a heightened scienter because the statutory structure is so overwhelming that Congress had this carefully calibrated scheme where they're spelling out when willfulness is required. Of the cases where the courts have said that willfulness is a necessary condition, which one would you cite as being -- as leading to the most unjust result? The case where -- where a court said we're not going to award profits because there wasn't any willfulness and that's very unjust based on the facts of the case, is there one you would cite as an example? No, because they don't say, like their -- the leading case, that Regis case by the highest court in Massachusetts, it just says, we're not going to -- although the law is conflicted, we're not going to allow profits, and they're mostly relating to a fraud-based tort.
So the underlying tort at the common law is one of fraud. And so I'm not sure they see it as particularly unjust if you're suing for fraud that you don't get relief if there's no fraud. But in the technical trademark cases where most of our cases come from, they are including the three cases -- well, the Hamilton-Brown case, they're saying you -- this property, your property was infringed so there's a pot of money that's going to rightfully belongs to you. And by the time you get around to your three cases, the Champion Sparkplug case and the Mishawaka case, the Court is balancing the circumstances.
It's saying, the willfulness is relevant but it also said, look, we don't think the plaintiff is really hurt, we don't think the defendant really benefitted.
You know, you get an injunction and go home. And so I just haven't seen cases where there was a mean court saying: Looks like you deserve it but I'm constrained by this willfulness requirement.
I don't know if that answers your question. Do you think it's open to us, Ms. Blatt, to pick a position someplace between you and Mr. Katyal? In other words, Mr. Katyal says, never under any circumstances can you get profits without willfulness and you say, well, willfulness is just one factor among the things that you think about. But I -- I would think that there's some kind of intermediate position, which is based on the history and -- and a general sense of it, which is that willfulness might not be a -- an absolute necessity but it certainly should be entitled to very significant weight. You know, you could say like a presumption of a kind. No, I would not say a presumption unless you're going to give us the same presumption, the presumption of compensation when other remedies aren't adequate and a presumption against unjust enrichment. And here's why we sort of used the Kirtsaeng case as an -- as an example in terms of fashioning our rule, is that I do think it's a sliding scale.
The more innocent the defendant, you better have a greater justification for compensation; and the more guilty the defendant is -- and then you might have some cases in between. But you could have a negligent or a reckless defendant, and I don't know where the presumption would fit.
And the Court should just balance it, should the plaintiff get at least one dollar in that case? And so a presumption just puts the -- the scales too heavy. I think all the courts recognize, and I said, it's a weighty and important factor.
So -- Well, how do you do this? Sure. I think -- I guess your view is there's no willfulness requirement. But what it says is the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover defendant's profits, damages, and the cost of the action -- okay, it says that -- subject to principles of equity. Okay? Now, we have a problem.
One thing to say is equity has always held that willfulness is necessary.
Good, we're finished with this case.
But that's not your position.
Your position -- It's also not true. No, well, I -- I -- I understand.
I understand.
Okay.
Can we say anything about what principles of equity require? Sure. All right.
Now, I notice the Sixth Circuit uses the word ""wrongful."" Do you want us to use that word? No. How do you want us to write that sentence? What principles of equity require? So -- and I think it helps to say that all of the courts have agreed on what the principles of equity mean.
They're the factors that start from the English cases up and through your cases.
The ones I said.
The defendant's culpability, the need that other relief doesn't adequately compensate the plaintiff, and the theory or are there profits that are -- is there just a -- you're holding on to profits that don't rightfully belong.
Those are the three.
Now, the Fifth Circuit and the Second Circuit has articulated this maybe in a six-factor test, but they're all getting at those three things. So the factors are clearly defined already in the case law.
The courts are all happy.
The only thing they're disagreeing about is whether willfulness is a gateway on/off switch. So I would be very happy with an opinion -- and this, if you want to advance the case law further away from where it is on our side, it's perfectly -- I think it's appropriate to say, because the defendant's culpability is a weighty factor, you should have other reasons. But part of the purposes where I would turn to in terms of -- you know, there is no other relief in almost all of these cases.
And the whole point of this is not only to -- it' not just giving the -- the mark owner some money; it is protecting consumers. The only other choice would be an injunction, and an injunction in some cases is either hard to get or it just doesn't work. Otherwise, there's no incentive for negligence. You might as well just take your -- you might as well just see what happens if you put some counterfeit stuff on.
If it's negligent, you're probably not going to have to pay.
It wasn't willful; it was just negligent.
Who cares? And so it seems like you should at least have something to deter infringement when -- just look at the statute.
The -- Congress obviously -- I have that part. -- cares about trademark infringement. But is it all right to say this, that there could be cases where -- some profits but not all profits? Yes. Is the equitable thing to do? Yes. Yes, so we could say that? Yes.
Yes.
And the parties on remand are actually, you know, going to debate about how much profits, and the ranges, you know, can be as low as $900 and they go all the way up from there. Well, that's a little strange.
I mean, equity either includes profits or it doesn't.
I don't know why you would just sort of split the baby and so each side is a little happy.
It's a principle of -- of equity.
And -- and you either get them or you don't. I mean, equity is not -- doesn't mean what seems fair.
It -- it's a little more complicated. Sorry, I was -- yeah, and this is a different, separate issue that I was referring to, not just profits, but there's a debate in this case whether you get profits that are attributable to the infringement.
So because this is a purse and a snap, there's the -- Oh, sure. That -- Well, that's a -- That -- -- different legal basis.
It's not the -- That's all I was talking about, yes. In response to Justice Breyer, you didn't -- No. -- didn't say, okay, profits are $100,000, you take 50; I'll take 50. No, so the profits that are attributable to the infringement, at least the other side would say, you know, you don't even get your $900.
Now, the only reason courts have lowered them would be laches.
You know, there are -- or unclean hands.
So there are principles.
Or for some reason you thought, I don't know, that -- it can't be a penalty, so for some reason you thought it was a penalty or excessive.
I could probably think of some hypotheticals where you might want to lower it, like say you thought the plaintiff was no longer going to be in business or who cared about the -- the goodwill.
But, yeah, the -- you're entitled to your profits and then -- but the court does allow an adjustment.
But -- The profits on the purse are -- are -- are $4 million.
The infringer did put in a copy of the trademark in a tiny little inside purse that nobody ever saw. So now he's entitled to profits, $4 million, when it's unlikely that anybody or maybe only three people were lured into buying his purse because -- so that's what I was thinking of. Maybe what he is entitled to is the purse -- is the profits on -- So -- -- on -- on three purses. So -- Or maybe -- -- there's a separate legal issue which the parties haven't briefed and there's no dispute in the case law, but it's just an amount, whether you're either limited to the attribution or -- and, if not, what kind of mental state would go over that.
I can make a very good argument -- Yeah, but it's still -- I mean, it's unlikely that there will be $4 million in profits attributable to this little thing that nobody could see, and that's a question.
But -- but I don't think that -- well, maybe it's right, maybe equity allows you of there -- you know, it just seems like too much, you say, well, I'm going to just give you less. I would say that the equity -- the traditional factors are -- are the equity ones I talked about.
The -- the statute does allow, the provision that Justice Breyer was focusing on, an adjustment for -- because you either think it's inadequate or excessive and it can't be a penalty or compensatory. I don't think that relates to equity. I think that's just a legal thing that the -- that the statute gives the courts discretion. If I can make -- make one other thing. The statute actually says you can go up to three times damages.
So -- Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My friend tries to make this case seem easy, but to do that, she has to sweep both Congress's words and two centuries of history under the rug.
We're here today because Congress expressly made that Lanham Act's monetary awards principles subject to the -- monetary awards subject to the ""principles of equity,"" and over many decades courts developed a principle that governs cases like this one. They required willfulness for the equitable remedy of profits awards, unlike for injunctions. For all the dust my friend tries to kick up about the cases in her brief, here's the bottom line on all the cited cases: Not one of them, none, actually awarded profits without willfulness in two centuries, either here or in the U.K., and in response to Justice Alito, she hasn't been able to give you a single example of an unjust result as a result of this long tradition. Now, trademark infringement isn't some newfangled violation like cyber-squatting.
It's one of the oldest violations in the book.
And that book, both before 1946 and after, required willfulness before a defendant could be forced to go through the burdensome process of accounting for its profits and risking a windfall. Five different treatises set out this rule.
Many cases speak of this categorical rule.
The remainder demonstrate a long-standing practice that -- which is, to use Judge Friendly and the Court's phrase in Halo, has narrowed the channel of discretion for awarding profits. Legislated Congress against the backdrop of that practice, which is why even the 1905 Act was interpreted to have a willfulness requirement, and that requirement is now expressed in the Lanham Act's reference to the principles of equity. With respect to my friend's textual arguments, she's asking you to believe that Congress, by implication in the '90s, invited -- intended to invite Congress -- the courts to do something they had never done in practice.
If Congress wanted to take that step, that would be huge news.
They would have said so. Her best argument is the 1999 amendment changes things, which is what she walked away from in her brief but is now resurrecting here.
And that has four problems: First, Congress in 1999 didn't repeal the textual hook for the willfulness requirement, which was the phrase ""principles of equity."" That's the way court after court had interpreted it, including the Tenth Circuit just the year before in the Bishop case.
Congress left that phrase untouched. Second, Congress never indicated anywhere in this -- in the 1999 Act that they were trying to modify the willfulness requirement in any way, which is what Judge Dyk said below, what the law professor's, Lemley, brief says here. Third, the 1999 amendment did something unique.
It was newfangled.
It introduced a new cause of action, trademark dilution, one which had no historical analogue. It didn't have a customer confusion element. Mr. Katyal, my basic problem is that as I'm looking at these cases, the term ""willfulness"" over the centuries has been differently defined by different people.
Some people have included recklessness. Others haven't. McCarthy, if you read his definition of willfulness, it does include recklessness and callous disregard and a whole bunch of blameworthy features.
There was a circuit split on this very issue when Congress acted in 1999. You don't think they count for much. You try to distinguish them.
But there are cases -- not many, I grant you -- where something less than willfulness was the basis for a recovery. Given the uncertainty of what willfulness means, the fact that there were exceptions to the common law rule, whether you recognize them as significant or not, how do we write an opinion that says you need willfulness a -- a la what you mean -- So -- -- willfulness being just conscious avoidance, not recklessness, not callous disregard, not this, not that? Justice Sotomayor, at the time -- How do we -- -- of the -- -- do that in light of 117(a), which doesn't have an equity limitation.
It says -- 117(a) says you can award profits.
If you think it's too much or too little, use your discretion. Absolutely, Justice Sotomayor.
That's what Congress said.
Once you pass the threshold of getting a profits award, which is of course in 1117(a), quote, ""subject to the principles of equity,"" then we absolutely agree there's discretion at the back end. That's where those equitable principles come in. But Congress at the front end did here exactly when it did in the injunction context and what this Court said in eBay, which is, there's a hard and fast requirement for principles of equity to show their irreparable harm.
You said it must be shown, even though equity is generally flexible, you've got to go through the gate. Here that gate is the same thing.
In 1946, she has -- Go -- -- got a case -- -- go to the more important part of my question, which is: What does willfulness mean? All right. And -- and where is there -- In -- -- a universal definition? Yes, we think there is a universal lowest common denominator of willfulness at least meaning what exactly the district court charged here, the petition appendix page 43A which is -- Common denominator -- Yeah -- -- which is to say it was the only -- -- which is the defendants must be actually aware of the infringing activity.
So there are five separate treatises that set that out as a hard and fast requirement, Nims and Ludlow and Jenkins and Haseltine, which, by the way, she misstates because she cites the wrong provision about Haseltine about injunctions, but page 305 with respect to profits says willfulness is required. Why should -- Case after case says willfulness meaning knowledge is -- is required. And my basic point is, she's got no case on the other side that disagrees with this with except the possible hypothetical of Oakes in 1883, which, again, didn't actually award profits in the absence of willfulness. And -- Mr. Katyal -- Why should -- -- you say that ""principle of equity"" means willfulness, but in many cases, as Ms. Blatt pointed out, the statute uses the word ""willfulness,"" so you say plain text, ""principles of equity."" I would say if it said ""willfulness,"" that would be plain text, but ""principles of equity""? So, Justice Ginsburg, as our brief explains, every time Congress -- and they certainly didn't use willfulness in the 1946 act.
Every time they added to it later on, there was a reason for it. So for example, in 1999, the reason they added to it is because you couldn't look to principles of equity to determine what was trademark dilution because that was a brand-newfangled defense which didn't have consumer confusion as a element.
So -- but here we're talking about the oldest violation in the book, trademark law. And I'd say, Justice Ginsburg, if you adopted that reading, which is -- she's trying to do, which is, oh, if Congress says the word in some other places by negative implication, then it's -- then it's out in other places, that would be a dangerous cannonball to the statute. Well -- So, for example, Section 1115(b)(9), which you can look at Joint Appendix page 135, that has that, that says that laches is available to fight incontestability and Section 1069 from the '46 Act says laches is available to contest inter partes determinations. If you adopted her reading, you'd be saying, well laches isn't anywhere else in -- Why should -- -- the statute. No, no, no -- Why should we assume that Congress wanted to exclude reckless infringement? Because Congress in 1946 acted against the backdrop of long-standing, consistent practice.
There is not a single example -- But there -- -- she is able to give you in which there was an award given. But as Justice Sotomayor points out, willfulness is a -- a vague word, ambiguous word, sometimes covered what we would consider recklessness.
So why would you, therefore -- Because -- -- exclude recklessness? -- here, Justice Kavanaugh, there's a more specific tradition. There's no doubt, cases like Ratzlaf say ""willfulness"" means different things in different contexts, but here it is always meant at least actual knowledge, subjective knowledge -- What would be -- -- and not recklessness. What would be the policy objective achieved by excluding -- Well -- -- reckless infringement? -- so we do think they are there, but we think Congress used this phrase and your job is to interpret the phrase -- I agree -- I -- -- and to essentially get to it.
But -- I understand that -- But -- But can you answer -- -- the policy -- Yeah. -- objectives are -- are, I think, incredibly strong, that is, the tradition of profits comes from equity and the idea that damages weren't -- weren't at that point in time available in courts of equity. And so courts looked to profits. Then there was a separate rationale of unjust enrichment but that was all about moral blameworthiness, about wrongdoing.
And someone who was innocent is not wrongdoing, which is why this Court in Saxel, Henner, and in McLean which states -- But if you're reckless, you're -- there is some wrongdoing. But I -- it's always been more than that.
The courts have always said you actually have to be subjectively knowing what you're doing -- subjectively on knowledge of what you're doing. The Moet case, which this Court has referred to twice as stating the rule both in 1877 in McLean and in 1900 in Saxel, Henner is a perfect example of this because in Moet what happened -- Moet, what happened is you had a champagne dealer who imported some bottles not knowing that they were spurious. And what the court said in England and what this Court cited with approval twice before the Lanham Act was, that's someone who's innocent, they're not engaged with wrongdoing. You can even have situations in which they're reckless.
For example, the Gorham case in 1912 was one in which you had a silverware dealer who was reckless, who blew off the fact that the -- that there was a stamp used on the -- on the silverware, which was really the -- a mark of a famous silverware company. But what this Court said is: No -- excuse me, what the southern district said is, no, you need more than that.
You need actual knowledge, and that -- Mr. Katyal, can we return to Justice Ginsburg's question for just a moment on the statutory text and whether principles of equity might be an unusual way of saying willfulness? As I understood your response to Justice Ginsburg, that we would -- we would perhaps read out laches as a defense, and -- and I -- I just -- my problem with that is that when we say ""principles of equity,"" we -- we mean laches.
Those are -- that is part of the trans- substantive history of equity. And if I go look at a treaty in equity, I'm going to find laches.
What I'm not going to find is a substantive rule about trademark.
For that, I have to go look at a trademark treatise, and -- so that's my problem textually.
And I -- I just want to give you a chance to respond to it. And I might ask you, really, isn't your argument nothing about principles of equity but about willfulness in the air? So -- And why didn't you make an argument that we should, as a background principle, assume some sort of consistency with the common law when Congress was legislating? You seem to have disclaimed that and said no, no, there's a textual hook here and it's principles of equity.
So that's a long wind-up, but those are my concerns that -- We certainly made exactly that argument citing Morissette in our brief for the idea, even if there weren't the price -- principles of equity, Congress acts against the backdrop of the common law and is deemed to interpret it.
So that's certainly there. I think it's common ground that principles of equity include will -- include knowledge and willfulness because she's even saying it's a factor.
That's how she started her argument, and it's at page 8 of her reply brief. So I think everyone agrees that it is a principle of equity, the -- the state of mind, it's just a question of how much weight you give it. Our point to you is, Congress in 1946 when they used the phrase ""principles of equity,"" I don't think just meant trans-substantive principles.
After all, it was the bedrock of a profits award.
Profits is, after all, an equitable remedy in the first place. And so in order to decide whether that equitable remedy should be given, you would look to the tradition of equity.
And that tradition has always been -- the long-standing practice for two centuries is that -- is that willfulness has been required.
And that's why there's not a single example on the other side. Now she says, well, this is hard, you're going to have to read all these cases, but I think that's the dog that didn't bark. Every single case that's given profits awards in two centuries has required willfulness, so the question is, is it worth the candle to make it a factor and run into the kind of standardless result that I think she's -- But -- but as Justice Sotomayor just pointed out, there wasn't -- there isn't in the cases a uniform agreement on what ""willful"" means.
And Justice Kagan had suggested that maybe it isn't all one way or all the other, so you can say the innocent infringer -- no profits when it's innocent.
But then there are shades of blameworthiness. And we not -- we're not going to make willfulness the essential one.
Maybe callous disregard.
Maybe reckless. Justice Ginsburg, ask her to cite a case in which callous disregard was enough before 1946 to find -- to -- to find a profits award.
She won't be able to cite one except for the theoretical possibility of Oakes. And my point to you is when you were interpreting the phrase ""principles of equity"" just as in Halo, just as in eBay, what this Court did is look to the long-standing practice -- Justice -- the Chief Justice's separate opinion in eBay referred to a page of history being worth a volume of logic.
And that's exactly what's happened here. That -- that wasn't original with me. (Laughter.) And that's exactly what's happened here, is that you've had two centuries in which this phrase, at equity, has been interpreted by court after court, and it is a fast rule.
Indeed, this Court in the McLean case, Justice Ginsburg, in 1877, said courts constantly refuse profits awards without that. And there isn't any tradition, there isn't any example on the other side, and there's treatise after treatise.
And, by the way, Justice Gorsuch, the Restatement is a general treatise -- the Restatement on Torts, it's not like, you know -- so -- but I do think actually the trademark-specific treatises would be what would be the relevant tradition here, if you're trying to understand -- Reading all those I'll -- I'll try this again and maybe I should ask you.
All right.
Suppose you win.
And so the callous disregard person can't get -- don't -- profits doesn't apply.
But this is really a rotten infringer.
And he behaved very badly. Can the winning trademark owner point to the sentence I read initially and say, Judge, it's not fair that they're not counting profits here, so don't call it profits, but give me a lot more money? Absolutely.
The statute -- this is what we say at page 54 of our brief allows treble damages for that -- No, I'm not just -- treble, but up to a limit? -- profits, but you can't treble profits -- Up to a limit? But a sentence -- You can't just treble profits because that is a harder -- Correct.
So -- so -- but the sentence I read has no such limitation. That's what's confusing me about it. Well -- So I thought is this all much ado about nothing. Well, again, I think that the award is subject in the first instance of the gate to principles of equity. Yeah, all right. Fine. But there's a much more important answer here, Justice -- Justice Breyer.
She can't come up in response to Justice Alito with a single time in which this happened, an unjust result, in two centuries. And the reason for that is trademark law focuses on protection of consumers in which injunctions and damages has always been enough, which is why there isn't an example on the other side. To the extent she has some theoretical argument, it should be one made to Congress. Congress dealt with it actually here, in this idea that -- I'm still trying to get the -- it's -- I don't know why I -- I can't get it.
I -- I must be missing something. Where it turns out for you having won that there is a case, imaginary, where the person does behave badly but doesn't meet the -- the thresh -- the threshold, does this sentence -- do you come across anything that suggests the sentence that I read does any work, where you would say, Judge, I agree, we don't get profits? It wasn't willful what he did, but it was pretty bad. Justice Breyer -- And so we want more money. Yes, Justice Breyer, it does work with respect to damages, not with respect to profits, because up above in 1117 -- Yeah. -- profits is subject to the principles of equity.
And that is a limitation.
But -- But damages is notoriously hard to prove, correct? Well, I actually disagree with that.
She doesn't cite any study or anything.
The only study I'm aware of is the Lex Machina study in 2017, which surveyed 2009 to 2017, and every trademark award and found that profits accounted for a total of 13 percent of profits awards and also 13 percent of the dollars. And to the extent you think that's somehow, you know -- you know, worth the candle or something and you should bump that up, that's something that I think Congress should be dealing with, but of course here they did.
They have a statutory damages provision to deal with low damages awards -- You -- you've mentioned a couple times whether it's worth the candle to not have a willfulness requirement, but is it worth the candle to exclude all reckless cases as Justice Breyer has stated -- Yes.
The reason -- -- when -- when willfulness will usually be a key factor in the calculus regardless of who wins here? Right.
We don't doubt that -- if we were to lose this case on remand, you should make very clear that willfulness is a key factor, the big kahuna or something like that, but our point to you is that the reason why a -- a reason why the common law rule makes sense is that willfulness cuts off, I think, the threat of very large profits awards. And this case is a perfect example. She sought $6 million, every dollar in profits for the sale of these handbags, and that's what she was referring to with this attribution thing.
And, indeed, they sought every dollar of Macy's profits, $7 million.
And Macy's is an entity that, you know, nobody is arguing had any knowledge whatsoever, way -- way, shape, or form, or even recklessness with respect to what was going on with these little snaps in the handbags. Well, counsel -- That's the danger. I -- how much would you have asked for? I mean -- I mean, it's -- it doesn't strike me as overreaching to ask for every dollar of the profits if you think you're entitled to profits. Well, that's the down -- that's the downside here.
And, indeed, the statute puts the burden on the defendant to disprove any attribution.
And so what -- one of the reasons why you have the willfulness requirement is to knock out and block circumstances in which high awards are threatened, and indeed settlements are forced, which happened in this very case. Now, she says, well, that's not going to deter enough and you need to have something extra, which, again, is something for Congress. Again, this is a perfect illustration, just the injunction alone cost us $4 million.
We had to remove all of these bags, right on the eve of Thanksgiving's big sales and the like. And so in a world in which you have injunctions and damages and all the attendant consequences of pulling inventory, would Congress really have intended to disrupt a 200-year-long tradition in order to -- to do this? And -- May I ask two questions about that tradition? The first is you've said several times that Ms. Blatt has zero cases, and I believe Ms. Blatt said that she had three cases. Right. So if you would address that. And the second is, although you point to a lot of cases in which the results come out your way, there are comparatively few where the court sets out the rule as a categorical one. You know, in many of these cases, the courts do seem to be thinking of willfulness as a factor, a significant factor, but not a gateway requirement. So those results might come out your way, but they don't articulate the rule that you propose, do they? Five -- yes.
Five separate treaties -- treatises and 37 of the 50 cited cases do set out the rule or say willfulness is the only factor.
But I think that's not the test this Court applies.
So, for example, in Halo, what this Court did was look to the long practice, and indeed the first case, main case, it cited was a case called Cincinnati Siemens, and it -- which was a case just about the facts of -- of a -- of damage awards and treble damages awards, but from that long-standing practice what the Court did was to -- was to -- was derive a principle. And that's what we're saying here. You've had a long-standing practice for 200 years, and, yes, Justice Kagan, those three cases do not stand up.
Even if she had three cases, we don't think an outlier three cases in 200 years is going to get her where she needs to go. But taking them in turn, one, Mishawaka Rubber.
This is the Sixth Circuit's determination, at 119 Federal Second 323.
The rule prevails in Michigan that an account of profits will not be taken where the wrongful use of a trademark has been merely accidental.
And then saying this rule is in harmony with the rule prevailing in the federal courts.
And, indeed, in Mishawaka Rubber, the Court limited the profits award to the period after May 19th, 1933, which was when they were on notice. So that's -- Mr. Katyal, the problem is, as I read those cases, you do have a handful, a little bit more than a handful, that say you need willful.
But a lot of those cases, including the quote you gave me, give the negative.
Accidental, good faith, is not enough.
That's not the same thing. We -- we agree not every case states the rule, but our -- But it also -- She doesn't have a case on the other side with the exception of the theoretical possibility of Oakes -- Why don't you -- -- which doesn't. Why don't you deal with the three cases that she points to. Yeah.
So the second case is Oakes, which has never once been cited again for that proposition.
We're not saying it's because it's from Alabama or something like that.
It's literally never been cited again for that proposition.
And, again, there was no award in that case. Well, it's only the last 20, maybe 30 years that we had Lexis to cite cases like that, but -- Well, I think, you know -- I think -- Lexis and Westlaw, but -- But, Justice Sotomayor, I think, you know, this Court in the McLean case said courts constantly refuse profits awards because of a lack of willfulness, citing the English case of Moet, which is the best case. It's on all fours with this.
That's the case that, case after case, Liberty Oil, the Nims treatise -- all of them are based on that fundamental root. And her third case was -- was Prest-O-Lite.
And, again, Prest-O-Lite -- and this is our -- in our red brief at page 42.
In page 444 of Prest-O-Lite is made clear that the conduct in that case was willful and that's why a profits award was given.
""What the defendants did was to fill tanks bearing the Complainant's trademark and either sell or distribute them for sale.
I have already found the defendant had knowledge of the practice of the dealers,"" and the like. So every single one of the cases she points to, I think, actually boomerangs.
It doesn't say what she says it does. This is true of other language in Romag's brief which makes this look a lot more complicated than it is.
McLean and Haseltine and -- and even Draper, she cites Draper but that's -- she -- it's only one judge.
She doesn't point out the other two judges disagreed with this. So, look, at the end of the day, she's got one case from Alabama in 1883, which was never actually resulted in an award of profits. You have five treatises on the other side.
You have 37 of the 50 cases which do state a rule, and 13 cases which are fully consistent with the rule.
I think that's at least as good as what the Frag -- But in -- -- Music case was. -- stating the rule in your brief, you consistently say good faith, not willful, innocent, not willful.
But there's a huge gray area, maybe not huge, but there is a gray area of behavior that's not good faith or innocent but reckless but nonetheless is not willful. Right, and -- And that -- and that -- your description in the brief consistent also seems consistent as Justice Sotomayor says with the rule. And I should have made this clear with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question.
Yes, the cases sometimes say ignorance or accidental or something like that. And so -- but there's at least a threshold of actual knowledge. There is no case that she's able to cite in which -- outside of the Oakes language in 1883, that you could read to say that something lower than -- something in which there's objective recklessness is enough to sustain a award of profits.
They always rely on subjective actual knowledge. How about subjective recklessness, conscious disregard of a substantial risk? Yeah.
So, you know, I don't think that -- I don't think the cases have gotten too into that one way or the other, but -- Right.
And that's that's key, right? No, I don't think so. Here, I think -- you know, here the question is that, you know, because here -- the district court here found, this is at page 47A, the evidence at trial at most could support a finding that Fossil was negligent, not that it acted in reckless disregard with willful blindness and the like.
So -- Mr. Katyal, could you explain the features of trademark that make it different from copyright and patent where as -- if I understand correctly, you can get profits without showing willfulness? Yeah.
So trademark law is fundamentally different from those.
Those are about ownership.
Here this is about consumer confusion and protection of consumers. And as our brief explains, once you go down that path, you have to worry -- and this is one of the reasons for the willfulness requirement, that willfulness litigation will be used to browbeat entities like Fossil and to seek massive amounts of profits, every dollar they made, and also downstream, not just the -- you know, not just the designer of the handbags but every entity that sells them, the Macy's of the world to the tune of $7 million. If Congress really wanted to do that and authorize such a revolutionary change in trademark law, one would think they'd say so and not leave it to negative implication because at the end of the day, what she's asking you to do is to say that Congress in 1999 put into the statute something that literally had never been done once in practice.
She has not a single time it's done. That's why this Court in interpreting the phrase ""principles of equity"" in -- in the Halo case said, look to the long tradition, look to what actually happened. You don't need an ironclad rule, just look to what happened.
Here what happened is one thing in the U.K. and in the U.S., for at least 180 years, which is no profits awards in the absence of willful conduct, at least subjective knowledge that what they were doing was wrong. That is the common denominator in Nims, the Restatement, and Ludlow and Jenkins and -- and the 37 cases cited in the brief. No other questions? Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt, five minutes. You may want to cut me off. So I -- I don't know what to say.
I didn't go to a fancy law school, but I'm very confident in my representation of the case law. Mishawaka is a case by you guys and you said in there, in the dissent, it was an innocent infringer, the profits were awarded. The district court case says, hey, I don't like the assertion that innocent people shouldn't get profits, but you guys can read the case and decide whether our assertion is credible but that is a district court case and it's a Supreme Court case by the dissent that acknowledges innocence. Oakes, it is what it is.
You can read it.
And Prest-O-Lite is the same. In terms of give me an example of an unjust case, I would start with this case, the argument is we get zero, even though there was callous disregard, even though their snaps were ripped off, even though it's a small business, even though, you know, that's all they make and it was a counterfeit snap, if we get zero or even a quarter, that would be unjust.
So that's my example. Second, on the treatises, I hope you read them.
Four of them use the word ""damages."" They don't distinguish profits.
They say a principal of trademark law is you don't get damages.
No damages absent willfulness.
He doesn't have a response to that. All of their cases but one say ""fraudulent intent."" So every case that articulates the rule uses the word ""fraudulent."" Not ""wrongful"" but"" fraudulent."" And that's not his argument here. Third, no case that we found under the 1905 Act applied a mental state requirement.
I don't -- I didn't hear him say a case. Four, he did drop the law professor brief, which I'm so glad because I'm going to quote from the leading cite of the law professor's brief, Thurman. The law was quote, ""not clear from 1870 through 1905."" The issue was ""unclear when the Lanham Act was enacted."" Specifically notes -- this is my favorite -- ""there was a majority and minority rule on the subject and the Supreme Court was in the minority."" So you guys had the minority rule because you didn't require willfulness in the Champion Sparkplug case and then apparently you muddied the waters in Mishawaka.
So that -- that's their treatise.
Oh.
Wait a minute, ""the end result is ambiguity."" So that's from their treatise.
And -- and four out of their five treatises use the word ""fraud."" You're quite right that I'll read the treatises and I've read the Lemly brief, and I will read the sources, but I don't understand your statement that they would receive no damages. So -- I thought the statute, that I have in front of me, says that they're entitled to recover profits and any damages sustained. Right. And so you don't need willfulness to recover any damages sustained, do you? Or have I miss understood what -- No.
I'm just saying -- -- they're saying? -- the logic of the Respondent's argument is that the same common law rule that required willfulness for profits in the same breath said fraudulent intent was also required for damages. So it's a -- All of those cases say that -- All of the treatises -- You're right. -- four out of the five. All of the treatises. Yeah, forgive me. One of the cases. Nobody is claiming, are they? I wouldn't -- Nope. No. Nope.
That's our argument. Nobody is claiming that you need willfulness for -- that the client, no matter how poor, no matter how -- he gets his damages, right? Right.
Our argument is -- the other side just wants to take you up to where they win this case.
The actual common law sources say fraudulent intent and it also extends to damages. This is just another way of saying the law was a mess and it wasn't that clear.
When three out of their eight cases say there was a conflict, I just think the whole notion of the Morissette or we cite that Fogerty versus Fantasy cases, if you just have a lack of clarity on the issue, you don't have a basis to presume that Congress wanted you to read in an unstated requirement. And I think in at least in the -- the -- -- the Justice Scalia and Garner book, it says, when you're talking about clarity, it's something that all the members of the bar had to agree was settled, and if the very case as it's -- that was conflicted, if the treatises say it wasn't clear, and if the cases are all over the map, again, the fact that we have three cases where they award profits is kind of either here nor there when we had eight cases that are just inconsistent with the willfulness requirement, including, I will end with, I will sit down early, is Champion Sparkplug case.
It's a case in 1947, it was construing the 1905 Act, said it's relevant.
And then it cited two other factors as part of the equities. That's, to me, you know, just -- it -- it would be hard to find a settled rule from 40 years of silence under the Lanham Act's predecessor.
Thank you. Ms. Blatt -- Thank you. -- Texas is a fine law school. I was just going to -- (Laughter.) Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-328, Rotkiske versus Klemm. Mr. Gant. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While this case is about the FDCPA, it is also fundamentally about the relationship between this Court and Congress.
That relationship has long been governed in part by two important presumptions relevant here: first, that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law and, second, that Congress legislates aware of this Court's decisions. When Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, this Court had long ago adopted a common law rule eventually known as the discovery rule applicable to cases of fraud and concealment. Citing to and quoting the Bailey decision of this Court from 1875, in Holmberg in 1946, this Court stated that it had long ago adopted as its own the old chancery rule, that where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any false or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered, though there will be no special circumstance or efforts on the part of the party committing the fraud to conceal it from the knowledge of the other party. The Court then continued in Holmberg explaining unequivocally this equitable doctrine is read into every federal statute of limitation and added even those where ""an explicit statute of limitation for bringing suit."" The United States concedes, as it has in prior cases, that there is a common law discovery rule applicable to fraud and concealment. In the decision below, the Third Circuit never mentioned the Holmberg case.
Its analysis began and ended with two words in Section 813(d), ""violation occurred."" The Third Circuit understood that those two words by implication, not expressly, but by implication -- that's at appendix page 8 -- displaced the common law discovery rule applicable to fraud. In reaching this conclusion, the Third Circuit deployed what I believe is a false dichotomy, what the Third Circuit described on the one hand as an occurrence rule and on the other hand a common law discovery rule.
And in the view of the Third Circuit, if a -- Congress deploys in a statute a so-called occurrence rule, a common law discovery rule is presumed to be displaced. The Third Circuit cited no decision of this Court in setting forth this dichotomy between an occurrence rule and a common law discovery rule.
The analysis is at page 6 of the appendix.
That conclusion of the Third Circuit is also in opposition to this Court's decision in 1918 in the Exploration case, which is discussed at length in our brief and the briefs of the other parties. There, that is, I think, fairly characterized as an occurrence rule.
The statute in Exploration ran from the date of issuance of a land patent.
So that was a date certain tied to facts. That, under the theory of the Third Circuit and my friends, is an occurrence rule, and there the Court determined that the common law discovery rule should apply. Mr. Gant, you keep saying fraud and self-concealing as if they're alternative rules.
I -- I think of there being multiple equitable doctrines, equitable tolling, equitable estoppel, and what I call the self-concealing fraud, which was the one mentioned in Exploration, argued by the government in Gabelli and in other cases. Are you creating a fourth -- Well, not -- -- that -- that -- that every case, every federal statute inherently says for whatever reason, if you didn't discover the fraud, equity could let you have a discovery rule? No.
I'm -- we're not intending to proffer a rule.
In fact, what we're attempting to do is advance the application of the already established rule, the Bailey/Holmberg rule, and my refrain -- I call it the self-concealing rule.
Is there -- that the fraud you committed is by its nature self-concealing.
Is that an accurate way of -- I -- -- stating that rule? -- I think so.
We're not intending to differentiate it. All right.
Then what do you make of Footnote 5 in the Third Circuit's opinion? Because four of the -- I guess they're justices or judges there, judges, would have remanded to allow the district court to consider whether he would be entitled to rely on this doctrine, being the self-concealing rule, because our precedent had not previously recognized that a defendant's self-concealing conduct may be a basis for equitable tolling. That seems to me that they understood the same thing I did, which is that there might be a self-concealing rule but that you had waived it, and that's why those four judges weren't voting to remand. How do you read that any differently? This is as good a time as any to get to an important issue here, which is the confusion -- understanding the relationship between what I'm calling the common law discovery rule, the Bailey/Holmberg rule, and the refrain I was using of -- of fraud or concealment comes from TRW directly, which is why I was using it but not intending to create a different doctrine. All of the parties here and the scholars' amicus brief that was submitted all agree that there has been at times confusing use of terminology.
And I think it is impeding an understanding of what is really going on in the courts below and this case and in the Third Circuit's discussion of these issues, including in Footnote 5 that you referred to, Your Honor. So let me, if I may, set -- in trying to answer your question, set forth what I think is the best understanding of the discovery rule on the one hand, the equitable tolling rule on the other hand, and then try and bring it directly to your question of what I understand the Third Circuit to have been doing in Footnote 5. Our view is that the best understanding of the discovery rule is that it applies when the plaintiff is unaware of their cause of action or the facts giving rise to the cause of action, here the violation, because of fraudulent conduct or self-concealing conduct by the defendant.
And in that situation, the clock for the statute of limitations does not begin to run at all. Equitable tolling, on the other hand, applies, we think, best understood, in a situation where the plaintiff is aware of the violation giving rise to a cause of action but, for some reason, in applying the elements set forth in this Court, exercised due diligence or was -- diligently pursued his or her rights but was unable because of some extraordinary circumstance to timely file suit.
Then, if the doctrine is deemed to apply, then the untimely filing is forgiven. And in that circumstance, the statute of limitations is best understood to have begun to run but then be tolled or abated because of the circumstances. That's our understanding of the -- of these rules, and that's the same understanding I think that the scholars' brief sets forth.
And it's -- under that view, equitable tolling would be best understood as not applicable to this situation. Now this Court, I respectfully submit, has sometimes used the label of ""equitable tolling"" to describe circumstances that I think are best understood as the Bailey/Holmberg discovery rule, and that has caused confusion here and -- and in courts below.
And I think it did cause confusion in the Third Circuit. And the Third Circuit appeared to operate under the view, at the time this case was decided, that self-concealing conduct did not qualify, that there had to be some separate act, apart from the elements of the offense, in addition that was concealing. An example that I'm familiar with from my own practice is in antitrust cases, where although they use the label of fraudulent concealment, which I think is best understood separately as a close cousin of the discovery rule, in those circumstances, you have a violation alleged of, say, Section 1 of the Sherman Act, a conspiracy. And most cases, when there's a statute of limitations argument that the conduct went back more than the four years provided in the statute, there's an argument about whether the conspiracy was concealed. Most courts there require some additional action in addition to the -- the -- there the conspiracy itself. Is the -- Here, what -- -- discovery -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- is the discovery rule equitable? I believe it is.
But I think it -- it is equitable but also properly understood as an exercise in statutory interpretation.
I don't think they're mutually exclusive. I grant you that. So the discovery rule could be part of a statute, but, if it's not part of a statute, there exists, I think you're saying, an equitable discovery rule as well that is akin to but maybe not the same as equitable tolling. Is that your argument? Yes to the last part of that, that equitable -- Can you just give me real clear on the answer? Yes. Because clarity, we do need clarity. I -- I will do my best and I -- I agree that that's useful for everybody. There's a distinction between statutory discovery rule, obviously, and the common law discovery rule. The statutory discovery rule is employed by Congress from time to time.
It was present in TRW, for example.
That was in my understanding the basis for the ruling in that case, principally, was that Congress had -- had decided to statutorily write in a discovery rule and then, applying traditional tools of statutory interpretation, determine that it wouldn't then also add on the common law discovery rule. So, when there is an absence like here of a statutory discovery rule, then the question becomes did Congress intend to permit or displace the addition or, in the words of Gabelli, the grafting on to, which I don't view as pejoratively, but I think my friends on the other side attempt to use that way, grafting on or -- on to or importing into the statute a common law discovery rule. When you use common law discovery, is that equivalent to equitable discovery? I -- I think it's the -- the doctrine that originated in equity, but also applied to cases of law, the Court said that back in Bailey, the doctrine had its origins in equity, applied to law, and it is applied, and I -- and here is where I think that it -- that it's both equitable in origins and I think in nature, but -- but also fundamentally an exercise in statutory interpretation, because the touchstone is whether or not intended -- Congress intended to foreclose or permit the application of the common law doctrine to the statute in the absence of some express indication. Well, if -- if you are arguing an across-the-board discovery rule applies to the FDCPA, I think that TRW weighs very heavily against you.
So you could -- you could be arguing across-the-board discovery rule or you could accept that there is a fraud exception. You seem to be arguing the first, that in -- that -- that the -- there's a discovery rule for all FDCPA cases. Justice Ginsburg, we -- we mean the latter.
So -- Before you -- except the fraud exception.
But then the government tells us that this case doesn't fit within the fraud exception. And -- and it clearly does. So, just to be clear, we're -- we're not arguing that every FDCPA action is timely so long as the plaintiff was unaware.
What we're saying is that, if they were unaware, because of circumstances that fit within the Bailey/Holmberg framework, fraud that prevented the plaintiff from knowing about their cause of action, under that long-standing doctrine, then the plaintiff is permitted to file out of time. Is it -- it's not a violation -- what -- what happened here serving the debtor at an address that was not the debtor's, that's not a violation of the FDCPA, is it? Unto itself it might not be, but we have a very different circumstance in this case.
So the facts that are alleged -- and you'll recall that this case comes to the Court on a ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion. So, of course, the Court construes the allegation -- accepts the allegations as true. The allegations as made and as understood by the lower courts were as follows: The Respondent retained a process server to serve -- file the complaint against my client.
There was an affidavit of service filled out that said that the head of the household had been served. And that was false.
And they had -- and we allege and the facts below assert that they had reason to know that that was false. So they filed a false affidavit of service, and that false affidavit of service was then the basis for a default judgment.
So it's those two actions together, the filing of a false affidavit of service and then obtaining a default judgment on that basis, that we contend violates Sections 807 and 808 of the statute which are codified at Section 1692(e) and (f). Those prohibit -- (e) prohibits any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means of pursuing a debt. That isn't the issue. I don't think the issue is, is your basic claim a claim of fraud.
And it doesn't sound it. I mean, did you -- who did you fraud? The judge? Yes.
The -- it was -- Have you ever heard of a case brought under this where the fraud -- you -- I mean, the cases that were brought where somebody said give me your land and I will, because the land has gold or something on it, that was a lie, so buy my land, it has gold on it, and they sell the land and it doesn't have gold on it.
That sort of fraud.
Okay? But I've never heard of a fraud case. I'm not saying you -- it may be actionable.
I mean, it may be that you recover under the statute, it may be a bad thing, but it doesn't sound like common law fraud to me. So is there something that -- where the person defrauded is a judge because the process server rightly or wrongly filed the wrong name? But that's what you're saying is a common law fraud? Yes.
The -- And what is the -- what is the case that says a process server who fills in the wrong name and fools the judge is -- the person who hired the process server is -- has committed common law fraud? Well, it's not -- with respect, Justice Breyer, it's not just the process server and -- and the allegations go further than an innocent mistake. And the other side argues that this was an innocent mistake. I'm asking you what here brings your case within the rubric of common law fraud.
So, if we had Lord Coke in front of us, you see, he would say, oh, I recognize this old man still recognizes that -- that this is common law fraud. Right. That's what I want to know. And our allegation is that the -- the -- the knowing misrepresentation on the affidavit of service or reckless representation, we cite to laws like -- Who -- who represented, who writes the representation? The process server or the -- your -- your -- or the other person? The process server signs -- signs under -- effectively under penalty of perjury -- Yeah. -- that the representations are true.
They were false.
And we contend -- And who makes the representations? The process server makes the representation. Oh, so is your client the process server? No.
That -- that's what I was getting to. Is that their client? It -- it is not.
That was the next point, which was that then the attorneys are the ones who file the affidavit of service, which we contend they had reason to know was false, and then the -- the attorneys then prosecute the case in obtaining a court to judge -- No, I know the latter part.
I -- I -- I got the latter part.
That's the harm.
But -- but the -- the -- the fraud consists of an attorney making a -- knowingly accepting the false statement of a process server? Yes. Now the closest case that you have found that calls that activity common law fraud is? We didn't look for a specific case, Your Honor. Oh, you didn't because it's so obvious that it's common law fraud? Well, if -- if -- you may not find this satisfactory, but we weren't the only ones here who thought that this constituted fraud.
The solicitor general's brief, I believe it's at page 26 -- No, no, I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm just trying to find out for myself.
And I -- and I'm not certain.
That's why I'm asking. Right.
And -- and so the solicitor general called this akin to fraudulent concealment. Akin to.
Now wait. Well, that's a totally different thing.
Your discovery -- look, I -- my bible on this is Judge Posner's opinion in the Cada case.
So, if that's wrong, you better stop me now.
But I've read that about -- I don't know whether it's wrong because I haven't read it, so I will not -- Well, it's a very good list of all these different doctrines, equitable estoppel, equitable this, and there are like six of them or something, and one of them, the thing that you're talking about now, is a special thing called -- what's it called? Undiscovered fraud. I thought an element of that is that the basic underlying thing is common law fraud. And that's what I'm trying to investigate now. But, if you have nothing more to say, I have nothing more -- I -- I -- -- to say because, if I knew more about it, I wouldn't ask the question. I -- I don't have a case. I wish I did.
Obviously, that is something that could be and we respectfully submit should be addressed on remand. The -- not only the solicitor general but one of the amici, the trade -- the major trade association for the creditors, the ACA, also acknowledged in their brief that what's -- what's at issue here -- it has a name, it's called ""sewer service"" -- it's so prevalent that it has a name.
There was testimony before Congress when the FDCPA was enacted.
A representative from the FTC came to Congress at the beginning of the hearings that led to the enactment of the statute and, in August of 1976, said that this phenomenon, which is at issue here, sewer service, is a major problem in many urban areas.
There -- But you said -- you said the statement was the process server.
The process server was told by the creditor serve process at this address.
So it wasn't -- the process server didn't make it up.
The process server was told where the process should be served. The -- the process server -- and I think it's helpful to understand for context here, there was an original suit that was withdrawn which also had a defective affidavit of service and then a subsequent one that led to the default judgment at issue here. It was the same process -- But it was still -- the prosecutor -- the process server was just following the directions of the person who -- who engaged the process server. Well, they were certainly following the direction to serve process.
We don't know -- there's nothing in the record that indicates the substance of the discussion.
We do know that the first service was attempted at an address and it falsely represented that the defendant -- the plaintiff was personally served.
He was not.
It also represented he was black, according to the affidavit of service. He's not.
He's Caucasian.
It represented he was 51 years old.
He was in his late 30s at the time.
That was at a -- and so they had reason -- and then that suit was withdrawn, we believe because they knew that the affidavit of service was false and that the plaintiff didn't actually live at that address. Then a new suit was filed and a new affidavit of service, the one at issue, was -- was filed. Mr. Gant. Yes. I -- I note it is terribly confusing because of the confusion of the use of terms.
That's why I -- I called it a self-concealing fraud. Yes. It's not the violation at issue that's self-concealing.
It's how the violation came about that's -- that could be by self-concealing fraud, correct? Yeah. Isn't that your -- your point? Yes.
We -- we believe that the common law discovery rule, the Bailey/Holmberg rule, can apply either if the fraud is an element of the offense -- Right. -- which it effectively is here under our view under subsections (e) and (f), or it can be separate and apart, in addition to the elements of the offense.
So, here, this seems -- there have been several questions, so I want to, if I could, just make this clear because I think the facts are important and they should be addressed on remand.
We're not saying we win on remand. We're -- the other side will get to make its arguments, including that we don't fit within the contours of fraud. But we believe that this is close -- what -- the decision below was you don't get a -- a common law discovery rule applied to this statute, period.
That was wrong.
That should be reversed, and we should have an opportunity then to have arguments about these issues, whether the approach of -- the view of Justice Breyer is right or at least -- or you're -- you're arguing, hypothetically, for argument's sake, the view of Judge Posner, that this might fall outside common law fraud. We don't think it does.
We cited Black's Law Dictionary.
In -- in my view, this falls squarely within the contours of common law fraud as described in Black's Law Dictionary, which is a misrepresentation.
It was a knowing misrepresentation to the court.
They served at an address that they knew was not his.
They said they served the head of the household.
And that was false.
And then they used that false affidavit, made -- sworn under oath.
The attorneys then went into court and used it as the basis for obtaining a default judgment, which then prevented my client from obtaining a mortgage, which he still doesn't have to this day. You've referred to remand a few times.
I think the other side's argument is that the statute itself does not have a discovery rule and that any equitable discovery rule or, as you're terming it, common law discovery rule that might exist, unless Congress expressly displaces it, was not raised in the Third Circuit.
Your response to that? I'm sorry, what wasn't raised in the Third Circuit? Equitable -- equitable discovery. It is true that equitable tolling per se was not addressed in the Third Circuit.
But Holmberg and Bailey were both cited to the Third Circuit, and at the time, it was clear in the Third Circuit -- But I think what they're saying -- and this may not be a winning argument, but I just want to get your response to it.
I think what they're saying is those were raised in the context of statutory interpretation.
Reading the statute, it does not contain a discovery rule. There may be still an equitable discovery rule, but you didn't separately -- I think they're saying this.
You didn't separately raise that kind of equitable discovery argument. Right. Your response to that? Is that wrong? Under -- they are wrong in their understanding of the operation of the two words ""violation occurred"" and its effect on whether the common law discovery rule applies. We say that that language is inconclusive with respect to the question of whether or not Congress intended to permit or preclude the application of the common law discovery rule, and we then urge the Court to apply traditional tools of statutory interpretation, to look to the statute's purpose to eliminate these Debt Collection Practice Act practices that are prohibited, the structure of the statute.
We discussed this at length in our briefs.
And based on those factors, we believe it's clear that Congress would have intended for the common law discovery rule to apply to this issue. And what about your petition in this Court? Because, as I read your petition in this Court, it was more about the general statutory interpretation question, whether there is a discovery rule that applies generally in this statute, than it is about whether certain equitable exceptions might continue to exist. Yes.
You're referring to the petition for certiorari? Yeah.
The petition for certiorari clearly presented the discovery rule for consideration.
And that -- Well, but, again, what did that mean? Well, I think -- As I read the petition, it really did not address whether there was an equitable exception of -- of -- of the -- of the kind that the Third Circuit might have thought had been waived. Well, that certainly wasn't how it was intended.
And you may know, I didn't draft that, as I -- I don't read it that way, and I -- I know for certain that that's -- was not intended to exclude that. What -- may I finish? Sure. What was intended with the petition was to raise the question precisely as I attempted to present it this morning, which is whether or not Congress intended to permit or foreclose the application of the common law discovery rule to the statute.
And we contend that Congress clearly did not intend to foreclose it. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Dvoretzky. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Gant and I agree that this case is about the relationship between this Court and Congress.
Congress provided in the FDCPA that the statute of limitations would begin to run when the violation occurs, not when it is discovered. That answers the question presented in the cert petition.
The plain meaning of ""violation occurs"" concerns when the defendant commits the violation, not when the plaintiff learns of it.
Unlike more ambiguous phrases, like ""claim accrues"" or ""liability arises,"" ""violation occurs"" simply can't be read any other way. And we know Congress itself understands ""violation occurs"" that way because, in other statutes, including the 1978 Right to Financial Privacy Act, Congress used the phrase ""violation occurs"" to distinguish an occurrence-based limitations period from a discovery-based one. But -- Is your position simply -- did I let you finish? I -- I think you still have a little time left, don't you? Oh, sorry. Like Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, I understand the question presented here to be whether an across-the-board discovery rule applies to the FDCPA.
The -- that's the only issue that the Third Circuit decided. The cert petition does not cite Bailey or Holmberg, doesn't mention the word ""fraud."" If it had, we might have had an argument in our brief in opposition for why this case doesn't present a fraud case and, therefore, would be an inadequate vehicle to consider that question. So the only question before this Court is whether -- should be whether there's an across-the-board discovery rule. Despite all of that, Mr. Gant focuses his argument this morning on the fraud cases. There are a number of reasons why the fraud cases don't ultimately help him.
I'd like to start out focusing on one, which is those cases are properly understood as equitable tolling cases, not as discovery rule cases. That's how this Court most recently characterized them in cases like ANZ and in Lozano.
And it matters for four reasons that the terminology be used correctly and that we distinguish between discovery rule and equitable tolling. The four reasons are the following. First, the two doctrines, the discovery rule and equitable tolling, are different concepts with different sources.
The discovery rule was about how to read the words Congress writes in a statute.
It's a statutory interpretation question.
That's the exercise that TRW was engaged in. Equitable tolling is about excusing noncompliance with the words that Congress has chosen.
It is an application of courts' inherent equitable powers, confirmed in the Judiciary Act, which exist independent of what Congress has said in any particular statute of limitations. As a result of that -- and this is my second point -- the discovery rule and equitable tolling have different scopes.
The discovery rule -- But I thought -- but I thought that the -- Justice Scalia and my opinion in TRW spoke about the discovery rule, not equitable tolling, exception to the discovery.
The discovery rule could apply in cases of fraud. Well, I think what TRW is talking about was that the discovery rule might apply to fraud statutes.
That's different from saying that there is a discovery rule in any case of fraud that happens to arise under a non-fraud statute, like the FDCPA. The words ""violation occurred"" -- ""occurs,"" have to mean the same thing no matter what the underlying type of FDCPA violation.
It can't mean violation occurs in a non-fraud claim, but violation occurs or is discovered in a fraud claim. And -- and that's why the way to think of excusing noncompliance with a limitations period in a situation that did present fraud would be as equitable tolling, because equitable tolling is a case-by-case doctrine in which courts use their inherent equitable powers to excuse noncompliance with the statute -- But -- -- on a particular fact. -- I mean, there might be variants of equitable tolling, mightn't there? I mean, one -- one variant is there were extraordinary circumstances, an earthquake hit, and so I couldn't file this suit in time, and so you should toll the statute of limitations until I can.
I mean, that would be one. And then a different one would be this kind of: I couldn't possibly have known that the statute of limitations had even started to run because there was fraud committed against me.
Is that right? I mean, you can put them all under an umbrella label, but those are two different things, aren't they? I agree that they would be under the same category of equitable relief because, in both situations, what a court would be doing is not applying the language that Congress wrote.
Congress didn't say anything about earthquakes. But Congress would be excusing compliance with the language that Congress -- I'm sorry, the court would be excusing compliance with the language that Congress wrote, based on either the earthquake or fraud. What those have in common is that they are under the bucket of equitable relief from what Congress wrote -- And is your -- -- rather than an -- -- and is your view that those are foreclosed by this statute, or is your view simply that those arguments were waived and this case has nothing to do about them -- with them? Our argument is that those arguments were waived.
They're not properly before this Court.
The only question before this Court is how to read the words that Congress wrote. And when Congress wrote the words ""violation occurred,"" it didn't leave the door open to read that across the board in every FDCPA case as violation occurs or is discovered. So you're -- Not -- -- not taking a position one way or the other about whether those equitable defenses can be raised? I -- I don't think that is presented by this -- by this case.
The issue hasn't been briefed.
The Third Circuit didn't -- the Third Circuit held that it was waived.
It's not presented in the cert petition and it's simply not -- But that's -- -- not part of this case. So -- so it's an open question, if you have a typical -- I don't know if it's typical -- but equitable tolling situation, the hurricane, you know, whatever, the -- even the courthouse is closed sort of thing, even though you're dealing with a statute of the sort you have here, that those claims could certainly be raised? Or at least you think it's an open question? We are not arguing that that's foreclosed by this statute.
We're saying that issue is simply not presented by this case. So -- And, similarly, the Bailey kind of equitable rule? You're also saying where -- you're -- you're also saying that you're just not saying? (Laughter.) We're saying that it wasn't preserved and, therefore, is not properly before this Court at this stage.
There's no -- there's no reason to remand on a question that all -- all members of the en banc Third Circuit Court held was waived.
Four members went out of their way to point out in Footnote 5 that they would have remanded if only it had been preserved, but -- but it wasn't. But I suppose what you have to maintain, though, is that equitable tolling has a higher or different threshold than simply a discovery rule? And -- and that is actually -- I said I had four reasons why I think the discovery rule and equitable tolling are different doctrines.
That's the third of them, is that I think equitable tolling has a higher bar. Equitable tolling applies only in extraordinary circumstances, which, as this Court said in Rotella, which distinguished between the discovery rule and equitable tolling, that's a virtue of equitable tolling, that it's the exception, not the rule. If -- if the Court is going to exercise its inherent equitable powers to override the language that Congress has written, that should be something that only happens in unusual, exceptional circumstances. Should -- look, my recollection of Cada and so forth, one, the statute might provide for tolling.
That's the argument in front of us.
You say no; he says yes.
You're going on the words. A second basis would be equitable tolling.
The -- the courthouse blows up or something, hurricane.
That's not here.
Forget it. The third is sometimes called equitable estoppel, and that's no man should benefit from his own wrong.
Hmm, that might apply here, except for the fact that the Third Circuit said absolutely waived, he never raised it, and so forth, and he doesn't even claim he raised that one. But there is a fourth one.
And the fourth one, which Justice Scalia said in this case, is out of Bailey, which applied from Lord Coke or something and his -- the ancient origins, and that's if your basic claim is a claim of fraud.
If your basic claim is a claim of fraud, there is a tolling rule. Now, one, was that ever raised clearly? Probably not.
Two, is the basic claim here was a claim that this is a -- an uncollectible debt, not that it was a fraudulent debt? I take it that the basic claim was not fraud, but I'm not sure on either of those points. So should we send it back on those points? No.
And -- and let me unpack that question and make three different points about it. First, the Bailey -- the Bailey line of authority, as Judge Posner described it in that Seventh Circuit case, still fits within the category of equitable relief from the statute, rather than interpreting the statute. Yes. And the only question presented in the cert petition, set aside even what happened in the Third Circuit, in the cert petition here is the question of statutory interpretation. The cert petition doesn't cite -- Bailey doesn't mention fraud.
It would be quite out of the ordinary for this Court to remand for consideration of a question that the lower court considered waived and didn't decide and that the Petitioner didn't even raise in the cert petition itself.
So that's one answer. But -- And the second point -- -- but if we don't agree with you that this is under the rubric of equitable tolling, I mean, I thought Justice Scalia was very clear when he said the discovery rule as a general matter doesn't toll when your statute of limitation triggered by the -- what was the occurrence -- of the violation, but, he said, there is an exception to the non-application of the discovery rule for fraud. We have recognized historical -- historical exception for cases based on fraud. Justice Ginsburg, the Court -- and it pains me to say this -- Justice Scalia, were not -- have not always been precise in their use of this terminology, but where it has mattered -- He's turning over in his grave hearing that. (Laughter.) Battle wordsmith. Where it has mattered, where it has been dispositive of an issue, such as in ANZ, the Court has been careful to distinguish between equitable doctrines, equitable tolling, and the discovery rule. And that is -- that is really the only way to read these cases, Bailey and Holmberg and Exploration Co.
They are best understood as equitable cases because throughout those opinions the Court is talking about the exercise of the -- of traditional equitable powers. And -- and those cases are not engaged in statutory interpretation.
If you look at a case like Bailey or Holmberg, it is not doing the same thing as TRW.
It's not even -- Holmberg, for example, was not even asking the question how do we parse the words ""liability arises"" or -- or, in Bailey, I think it was ""cause of action accrued."" It's not even a question of what that language means.
It's simply creating an exception to it.
And that is the better way to understand those -- those cases. In -- in any event, even if there were some sort of a fraud discovery rule, that still wouldn't help here for three reasons, one of which is the waiver, which I've talked about. Two, even if there is a background -- even if there were a background fraud discovery rule, Congress could still overcome that.
It would still only be a presumption. And the language that Congress used here, ""violation occurs,"" would overcome any common law discovery rule. Well, how -- Do you really think that? I'm -- If a patent -- Go ahead. -- issued, which is like what a violation -- when a violation occurs, we still apply the equitable doctrine, the concealment doctrine in Exploration, even though the languages are almost identical. So how do you separate Exploration from here? Because I think what the Court was doing in Exploration Co. is best understood as equitable tolling, not as reading that language about the patent issuing to mean patent issuing or is discovered. This -- this goes to the fundamental question of what is the Court doing? Is it interpreting the language like ""patent issued"" or ""violation occurred"" to mean something other than what it says, or is it exercising the Court's inherent equitable power to override what the language says? And that -- So are you saying there's no self-concealing fraud whatsoever? That the very act that you do -- this is what they're claiming -- the very act that they -- that you are alleged to have done doesn't -- wouldn't qualify? Assuming -- and I know that you take issue with whether you really knew that was his address or not and whether the lawyer just made a mistake in not seeing his regular files.
I want to put all of that aside. Let -- let us assume for the sake of argument that the lawyer knew this wasn't the address, that the lawyer knew the process server had effected sewage service, and yet he lied, intentionally lied, to the court and held on to his judgment until the statute of limitation passed.
Do you believe that there's no common law self-concealing fraud there? I don't think that that is common law self-concealing fraud.
I think that that might well qualify for equitable tolling.
You don't need to put the fraud label on it for it to be equitable tolling in a case where the court actually decided that equitable tolling was properly presented and preserved. But I don't think that that would be common law fraud because it does not involve an intentional misrepresentation.
That's -- that's not alleged here -- Not to the defendant but to the court.
It's still conduct that would be fraudulent, maybe not on the -- on -- on -- on the defendant but certainly on the court.
And why should that deprive the defendant of a cause of action? Well, perhaps it shouldn't if that's what's actually alleged and if it's dealt with as equitable tolling rather than -- rather than reading language like ""violation occurs"" to trigger the limitations period upon anything other than when the violation occurs. With -- with respect to this case, though, it's not just the waiver in this Court and in the Third Circuit.
I'd also direct the Court to the complaint in this case.
It's a three-page complaint, and it's in the court of appeals appendix at 6a. The -- the operative complaint itself does not allege what is now being described as so-called sewer service.
The -- the operative complaint alleges that the -- the debt collection lawsuit here was filed out of time and that, as a result of the -- as a result of what happened with the improper service, the -- the plaintiff was entitled to equitable tolling on that claim because he didn't learn of the untimely lawsuit. So, on a 12(b) motion, which is what we're dealing with here, we are miles removed from the sorts of allegations in some of the amicus briefs about different cases involving sewer service. Can I make sure -- The -- -- I have the terminology correct -- sorry -- on a couple of the legal points? So, on the discovery rule, there's a discovery rule linked to fraud, as Justice Ginsburg said.
You first look to whether it's in the statute.
You say no. If it's not in the statute, if you're correct about that, you see if there's some kind of -- there's an equitable discovery doctrine, also linked to fraud, that can apply.
But your argument is that no equitable doctrines were raised here and, therefore, we shouldn't consider the scope of how that might apply.
Is that accurate? I think that would be a good opinion. Okay.
The other part of that is you were making an argument that the words of the statute here expressly displaced equitable discovery.
And I think that's a shakier argument because that would mean any time it's not in the statute itself, it's also -- meaning discovery, it's also expressly displaced. You don't need this argument to win, but you are giving it as an alternative, and I want to press you on that. That -- so that's actually not the argument that I am intending to make. Okay. I don't think that Congress needs to expressly say no discovery rule in order to foreclose the discovery rule. If you had more ambiguous -- Well -- -- language -- -- I -- In order to foreclose -- -- I know you're not saying that -- -- an equitable doctrine.
You don't think that Congress has to say no equitable doctrines? But even for the statutory discovery rule, I don't think Congress has to expressly foreclose a statutory discovery rule. Oh, sorry. In -- in a situation where, let's say, you had language like -- Yeah.
I agree with you on that, on the statutory discovery. Oh. Okay? So just assume I'm with you. Okay. But there still exists, I think you just said, a kind of equitable discovery rule unless Congress has displaced that.
And I would assume there's a higher bar for Congress to expressly displace the equitable discovery than there is for whether it's in the statute in the first place. I -- I agree, and -- and the only tweak that I would make to, I think, the way that you've formulated all of that, I view the equitable discovery rule just as a species of equitable tolling. Got it. If, like Judge Posner, you want to list out all seven different kinds of equitable doctrines that allow a court to override what Congress has written, that would be one of them.
But I think the more helpful way to think of it is that there are two categories. There's statutory interpretation. What has Congress provided as -- as the -- the rule to apply across this statute in every FDCPA case.
As to that question, ""violation occurs"" means violation occurs, not discovered. Then there's another bucket of various equitable doctrines that can be invoked under the courts' authority to override statutory language. So I -- I -- None of those are presented. -- I think that that distinction is helpful, but I want to push back on it a little because it's all statutory interpretation, isn't it? I mean, as long as we understand that Congress could say, ""and no equitable doctrines shall apply either,"" then, in some sense, we're doing statutory interpretation even when we say that Congress didn't displace statute -- equitable doctrines, aren't we? Sure.
There's always the question of whether Congress has overridden the long-standing equitable power of the court to itself override the statutory terms that Congress has used.
So there -- there is a statutory interpretation question there. But the difference between the equitable doctrines and the discovery rule, as I'm using that term, is that there is a presumption in favor of the availability of the court's equitable powers.
And there's a higher bar that Congress has to use -- You'd need a -- -- in order to foreclose that if we're in the equitable bucket. -- you'd need something akin to a plain statement to get rid of the equitable doctrines in the statute.
You probably are going to frown on the phrase ""plain statement"" but something clearer. Something clearer. This Court has often looked to the sort of two-part -- Because they're -- -- structure -- -- equitable, so we're not going to assume silence displaces these equitable doctrines, right? Correct.
You're not going to assume silence does.
This Court has typically looked to a sort of two-part structure where you would have a shorter discovery-based limitations period, coupled with a longer statute of repose.
And -- and if you have that, this Court has read into that sort of situation that Congress meant to displace equitable powers. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Bond. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question on which this Court granted review and the only question the Third Circuit decided is whether the FDCPA should be interpreted to impose a statute-wide rule that the limitations period does not begin to run until a violation is discovered.
That's a question about what the statute means, and the text supplies a clear answer: No. Now Petitioner appears to be abandoning reliance on that broad theory and is now relying exclusively on this argument from Bailey's fraud rule.
We agree with Respondent that Bailey's fraud rule does not apply in this case, at least as it's been teed up for the Court, for three reasons -- or -- or -- or three points I'd like to make. First, we agree with Respondent that the fundamental distinction that matters is between interpreting the way a statute of limitations operates and equitable relief from that statute.
It's the distinction this Court drew in ANZ in describing American Pipe.
You've got interpreting and enforcing statutes, and you've got equitable relief from the -- the operation of the statute. And it's true that those are all statutory interpretation questions, but they're very different questions because, on the one hand, a discovery rule that comes out of the statute has to be in the text and context of the statute, whereas equitable relief, whether it's viewed as one umbrella doctrine or subdivided into several different species, are all exercises of courts' traditional free-standing powers, courts of equity, to relieve parties from the operation of a statute. And we -- we agree with Respondent that that difference matters, not just with respect to how clear a statute must be to displace or make clear that that doctrine doesn't apply, but also the scope of the rule that results, as the Court observed in Rotella. So, to put it in terms of Judge Posner's opinion in Cada, the first category of the statute's accrual rule set forth in the statute, that's our first bucket.
Everything else fits into that second bucket.
And it's simply a question of whether you subdivide into -- to subsidiary categories or not. Now the second point is where Bailey fits in this taxonomy.
Now we acknowledge that language in the Court's opinions over the -- of the past number of years have sent some mixed signals.
To the extent you address it here, we think the better view is that those cases are understood as applications of equitable principles, whether equitable tolling or a close cousin, for three reasons. First, the rule arose at equity, starting in courts of chancery, and later carried over to courts at law. Second, that's really the only way to understand cases like Exploration Company, where the statute by its terms doesn't run from discovery, doesn't leave room for a discovery rule.
That can't be read to impose a discovery rule, but it certainly can be understood not to displace background equitable principles. And, third, the Court has repeatedly and recently cited Bailey and Holmberg and other cases, including in contexts where it mattered, as Mr. Dvoretzky was explaining, on the equitable side of the line. The most recent example, as he noted, is ANZ.
And in that case, it mattered whether American Pipe was equitable or statutory in nature.
And the Court relied on the fact that American Pipe had cited Holmberg, which ANZ called a paradigm application of equitable tolling. So we think the Court's most recent and repeated word on this is that it falls on the equitable side of the line. But even if you think there are cases where there -- you have an ambiguous statutory provision and you can look to equitable principles to help you figure that out, that's fine, but the underlying principle is still equitable in nature.
And that would be like the Court's opinion in Merck, where you had an express discovery rule and the question is what does discovery mean. So the Court surveyed equitable practice, state statutes, and all manner of things that were relevant to figuring out what Congress meant in that provision. Do you think that that equitable principle is the same as the way the Court has defined equitable tolling, meaning we have very -- we have very strict construction under equitable tolling and certain elements to it. Do you think the same apply more broadly to all the equitable principles, or is it a separate principle all together? So our -- our view -- and I'm not sure anything turns on it here -- is that it's a subset of that broader equitable principle.
You might think of it in terms of the kind of fraud that satisfies Bailey, which is fraud that is either concealed affirmatively or self-concealing, satisfies by itself the extraordinary circumstance requirement of tolling. And then the second element, diligence, is just the same across both -- both contexts. So it seems like a subset of the broader principle of equitable tolling, which explains why the Court's decisions in cases where it mattered, not just in ANZ but in Lampf and in Rotella, described cases like Holmberg and Bailey as falling into this bucket. So we -- we understand it to fall in the equitable tolling or the equitable relief side of the line, but, at the end of the day, to decide this case, I don't think you need to resolve that particular question. If it's any kind of equitable relief, I think Petitioner has disclaimed reliance on that and certainly didn't present that below or in the petition, but even if you think it's a -- a -- a statutory rule that could be read into every statute, we don't think this falls within the category of fraud claims. As Mr. Dvoretzky was explaining, I don't think the complaint here, the single allegation that concerns improper service, paragraph 14 of the complaint, doesn't allege any kind of misrepresentation, isn't premised on fraud. And to the point of amendment, when the district court asked Petitioner's counsel if he would like to amend -- and this is at page 104-A of the court of appeals appendix, Volume 2 -- Petitioner's counsel emphatically said no. So I think that ship has sailed. Ultimately, we don't have a strong interest in whether you apply that rule here or leave it to the Third Circuit, but I think respect for the court of appeals and the integrity of the certiorari process suggests that you should take the Petitioner -- the petition at its word and decide the case on those terms. If the Court has no further questions. I have one. (Laughter.) Why does it matter that it is a fraud claim, rather than, whatever the claim is, fraud has been used to prevent the plaintiff from noticing it? So, if you understand Bailey as an application of more general equitable principles that grant relief not just from fraud but from fraudulent concealment and other kinds of extraordinary circumstances, like the earthquake, then we don't think it does matter. Bailey, I think, is best understood as applying those general principles in the particular context that was recurring at the time of fraud claims. So, if you understand it that way, there's no rigid boundary.
Bailey is simply explaining how those general principles apply in a particular setting. If instead you understand Bailey, however, as a rule of statutory interpretation that departs from the way we ordinarily read -- read statutes, then we'd suggest you should apply that exception, that departure on its own terms rather than expanding it, as I think Petitioner had suggested in the briefing. But, again, if you understand it as an application of equitable principles, you don't need to draw a line between the gravamen of the underlying claim, which is what Bailey focused on, the object or foundation of the suit, or other examples, like Holmberg, which wasn't a fraud action but involved fraudulent concealment. If you view those cases of a piece as involving general principles of equitable relief, then everything hangs together. If the Court has no questions. Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Gant. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Perhaps ambitiously I will try and quickly make five points that I hope address some of the questions raised by the Court this morning. First, there's no question that this Court, although, when Bailey and Holmberg were decided, didn't use the label discovery rule. In more recent cases, like Merck and Gabelli, has clearly identified a discovery rule which I think under the best reading is separate from equitable tolling. The second point is that there's an argument advanced in the briefs and today by both counsel for the Respondent of the United States that the issue is whether a statute is all or nothing.
Either a -- a common law discovery rule applies to every claim under the statute or to none at all. That -- that view is unsupported and contradicted by Bailey, Exploration, and Holmberg itself.
Bailey was a bankruptcy court -- a bankruptcy act case.
Exploration dealt with a statute concerning land patents.
And Holmberg concerned the Federal Farm Loan Act. Those were not cases -- the Holmberg/Bailey rule applied to a subset of cases under the statute where the doctrine otherwise applied.
It wasn't all or nothing, as my friends suggest. The third point concerns confusion about the relationship of the doctrines.
Mr. Bond said that the Court has in the past sent mixed signals.
I think that's a fair characterization.
And I think that, unfortunately, those mixed signals caused confusion both on the part of the parties and in the courts below. In Gabelli in Footnote 2, this Court observed that the Second Circuit in the case being reviewed had -- had -- was adding to an equitable tolling claim the requirement that there be some action in addition to the cause of action that caused the concealment.
That is the same idea that is present in Footnote 5 in the Third Circuit's decision below. The Third Circuit said -- and this wasn't -- this was for the Court, it wasn't just on behalf of those four members who would have wished to review equitable tolling.
The court as a whole said our precedent has not previously recognized that a defendant's self-concealing conduct may be the basis for equitable tolling. So the Third Circuit, which, by the way, had gone en banc sua sponte, was recognizing that previously its own cases had said that there had to be some additional acts, not that self-concealment alone wasn't sufficient for equitable tolling, that was the reason why that equitable tolling was not pressed below, because, under existing Third Circuit law, there was a requirement for some additional action, which Petitioner's counsel did not believe was present here. The next point is -- concerns this question of whether the discovery rule is a matter of an exception, an equitable exception to a statute which is imposed by courts themselves, or whether it's statutory interpretation. The touchstone in either case, as Justice Kagan, I believe, was -- was alluding to, is congressional intent.
And we believe that Congress here, when you look at the statute as a whole, not ignoring the language in 813(d) but the statute as a whole, including its purposes, including its exhortation that it wanted to eliminate the practices at issues, clearly would not have meant to foreclose a lawsuit by -- which presented facts like Petitioner's facts here. The final point I'd like to raise concerns -- sorry, one final -- other point related to that. I believe I heard counsel for the Respondent say that under his view the discovery rule is a subset of equitable tolling.
I could understand why one would come to that view given the confusion in the doctrine.
I've set out a different view, which we think is the better understanding. But, if their view is correct, then I don't know how they can argue it was waived.
If the discovery -- the Holmberg/Bailey rule is a subset of equitable tolling, we pressed the Bailey/Holmberg rule below.
Those cases were cited in the supplemental briefing after the Court decided to go en banc. So I think the assertion that the arguments that we're presenting here were waived are -- are incorrect. The final point concerns Respondent's challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint. The district -- the district court in the Third Circuit here understood exactly what was at issue. I must candidly acknowledge that the complaint here was not a paragon of clarity.
It could have been done better.
And if we were given the opportunity on remand, which we would because Rule 15 provides for liberal amend -- amendment of pleadings, we would make clear that the challenged conduct violates 1692(e) and (f) of the statute, which we believe clearly falls within the ambit of the common law discovery rule. Unless the Court has further questions, I thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 19-7, Seila Law versus the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Shanmugam. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The structure of the CFPB is unprecedented and unconstitutional.
Never before in American history has Congress given so much executive power to a single individual who does not answer to the President.
By significantly limiting the President's ability to remove the CFPB's director, Congress violated the core presidential prerogatives to exercise the executive power and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. This Court has recognized and reaffirmed the principle that the Constitution empowers the President to keep principal officers accountable by removing them at will. While the Court created a narrow exception in Humphrey's Executor in the context of a multi-member commission, it has since distanced itself from the reasoning of that decision.
And there's no valid basis for extending it to the The Court should also reject amicus's proposed test, seemingly based on Morrison versus Olson, which would extend Morrison to principal officers and permit significant limitations on the President's ability to remove even his closest advisors. Now, as to the question of remedy, the Solicitor General contends that the Court should rewrite the Dodd-Frank Act to give the President the power to remove the director.
But the constitutional question in this case arises in the context of a defense to an enforcement proceeding and not a facial challenge. The Court can provide complete relief by invalidating the Civil Investigative Demand and reversing the judgment below. In any event, the text and context of the Dodd-Frank Act make clear that Congress wanted to create an agency that was independent to the fullest extent possible and not to vest vast power in an agency that was subject to presidential control without any congressional control over its funding. The government's proposed remedy would have the perverse effect of making the CFPB less independent than agencies it was replacing. The Court should leave to Congress the quintessentially legislative task of deciding how to fix the CFPB's defective structure. Mr. Shanmugam, this case has kind of an academic quality to it.
The demand in question was ratified by an acting head who was subject to the President's removal power, without qualification. I don't see how the composition of the Bureau affects your client since your client was -- the adverse action is now attributable to someone who the President could remove at will. And I don't see how differently you would be affected if the same thing occurred with the President having the power to remove at will. So whatever might have been with the Board head that was responsible for this demand, the acting head is fully removable by the President. Justice Ginsburg, there is a live dispute between us and the government because we want the Civil Investigative Demand to be invalidated and the government seeks to enforce it. On this question of ratification, we don't believe that there is a live issue on ratification, not least because, when the government raised this issue below, it presented no evidence, no factual evidence, that the acting director, in fact, ratified the Civil Investigative Demand. But where we agree with the government is that, at most, that would be an issue that would be live on remand.
And the issue of ratification was raised at the certiorari stage, and both we and the government agree that that is not a live issue before the Court.
Where we disagree is that the government is trying to resuscitate that as a potential argument that it could make on remand. But, in terms of this Court's traditional jurisdictional doctrines, there is a live dispute, and, therefore, there is no mootness here.
And we plainly have standing, including standing to appeal, because our injury is the fact that my client is subject today to a Civil Investigative Demand that even today the government is seeking still to enforce. But you would be -- May I ask -- -- you would be harmed in the very same way if the President had the full removal power. If the President had the full removal power and then a properly appointed and removable director sought to enforce a Civil Investigative Demand against us, then, sure, we would no longer have the argument that we are making now. But this Court time and again has said that where an action has been taken by an unaccountable executive official, that creates a here-and-now injury and an injury that a private individual can vindicate.
Where the separation of powers has been violated, a private individual, no less than an aggrieved removed official, has the ability to raise that issue. My problem is more -- somewhat like Justice Ginsburg's, but you started by saying an unprecedented agency. Well, there is at least two others, the Office of Special Counsel and the Social Security Administration, which have single heads subject to some limitations on removal. And I see the Social Security Administration being as powerful, if not more powerful, than this agency, because the Social Security Administration affects virtually every American.
This agency is limited to the financial market. And with respect to the amount of money that it distributes or can seek restitution on, it's comparable to the Social Security Administration.
So I don't think this is so unprecedented as you claim. I would differ with you, Justice Sotomayor, only in that I do think that the level of executive power wielded by the CFPB is unprecedented precisely because it takes enforcement action. The Social Security Administration unquestionably affects millions of Americans, but one thing it doesn't do is to take enforcement action.
There -- it poses no threat to individual liberty. And as you are aware, the Social Security Administration was turned into a single-director agency with only for-cause removal relatively recently.
Indeed, independent agencies with for-cause removal restrictions more generally are of comparatively recent vintage, but these sorts of single-director agencies are even more recent. Given that your client is not the President, it seems to me that the person who should be complaining is the President, not your client. Shouldn't we address the severability question and leave for another day the issue that would cause harm, i.e., shouldn't we address severability first? If we find this severable, then it's academic whether the person -- President has power.
And shouldn't we do what we've done for over 200 years of this country and wait until there's an actual dispute between the President and a director that he or she -- that he or she wants to fire? This Court, in the modern era, has not required there to be a contested removal.
There was no such contested removal in Morrison or Bowsher or Free Enterprise Fund, and that is because, as this Court stated in Bond, the separation of powers creates an injury that a private party can vindicate because an action -- That's not my point.
My point is, isn't it mooted here if we find this severable? No.
And I want to address that directly because that is a suggestion that is made in the amicus brief filed by Professor Harrison, and the fundamental problem with the suggestion that the Court can somehow resolve the question by addressing severability first is that in -- that would in no way validate the Civil Investigative Demand in this case. Even if there is severability, there is still a Civil Investigative Demand that was issued by a director who at the time was unaccountable.
And this Court's cases, Bowsher, Lucia, and others, make clear that when you have an action taken by an unaccountable official or an official who is, you know, either improperly appointed or is subject to an improper removal restriction, that action is void full stop. And that is why we submit that on the question of remedy, the appropriate remedy here is simply to invalidate the Civil Investigative Demand and to stop.
That is the more modest remedy here than proceeding to the question of severability. Well, speaking about modesty, this is a very modest restraint, inefficiency, malfeasance.
It -- it stops the President from at whim removing someone, replacing someone with someone who is loyal to the President rather than to the consumers that the Bureau is set up to serve. You talked about liberty.
Now whose liberty are we speaking of? What about the consumers? I mean, Congress passed this law so that the consumers would be better protected against financial fraud.
And you're talking about, I suppose, the liberty of your client. But what about the people that Congress was concerned about, that is, the consumers, who were not well protected by the array of agencies that were handling these problems? So two points in response to that, Justice Ginsburg.
The first is that the for-cause removal restriction here, the inefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance standard, has never been understood to be a modest standard and certainly cannot be read to permit what we think the Constitution requires; namely, that the President be able to remove a subordinate not just because of policy disagreements but because the President has lost faith in the official's judgment or because the President wants someone of his or her own choosing. But I think, second, to the extent that we're talking about Congress's goal here, there is abundant evidence that what Congress was trying to do was to create an agency that precisely, because of its desire to protect consumers, was insulated from political control to the fullest extent possible. As Elizabeth Warren, who was really the progenitor of the CFPB, said at the time, if Congress did not create an agency with functional independence, ""my second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor."" And so, if this Court is considering what the hypothetical Congress -- what Congress would have hypothetically wanted at the time of the Dodd-Frank Act, I don't think that what Congress would have wanted was the creation of an agency that was fully subject to the President's control. I -- I think Justice Ginsburg's point included what the standard would be like, the inefficiency, malfeasance, whatever, and I don't think we've done this in prior cases, but wouldn't the normal principles of constitutional avoidance suggest that we might want to scrutinize a little bit how rigorous a limitation that is before we get to the point of striking down the statute? I mean, just take inefficiency.
I mean, the President might determine that a particular approach of the agency to consumer protection was not as efficient as another approach.
And I don't know why you couldn't say that that's a ground of efficiency that -- that he could act upon. And, theoretically, I don't know that the courts would be terribly suited to second-guess that judgment. Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that that term has ever been understood that broadly, and, of course, this Court has a long history of dealing with the inefficiency, neglect, and malfeasance standard dating back to Humphrey's Executor. And I would refer the Court to Judge Wilkinson's concurring opinion in the D.C. Circuit in PHH, which I think walks through each of the terms and explains why what those terms really require is something closer to outright incompetence.
And not surprisingly, Presidents have only very rarely invoked their authority at all to remove officers under that standard. But -- but, if this Court were to somehow convert that standard into what we think it constitutionally would need to be, which is effectively an at-will standard, then, sure, that would have essentially the same effect as overruling Humphrey's Executor because it would permit Presidents, where they disagree with the policy priorities of these officials, to remove them. On severability -- So, for instance -- And so, if we -- No, go ahead. On severability, what do you do with the text of the severability clause? You -- you mentioned we would be rewriting the Dodd-Frank Act. But wouldn't we be rewriting it by ignoring the text of the severability clause? I -- I -- I don't think so, Justice Kavanaugh.
And mindful of your opinion when you were on the D.C. Circuit on this issue, I would say two things. The first is that I think that the text of the boilerplate severability clause in the Dodd-Frank Act can be read to say, in essence, only that if you strike an invalid constitutional provision, the entirety of the remainder of the Act shall not fall. And part of the reason why you may want to give the boilerplate provision that interpretation is because of the more specific severability provision in Title V, which I think by the government's own concession would be rendered superfluous if you don't adopt our proposed meaning. But, if you disagree with me on that, I do have a second point, which is that this Court has consistently made clear the severability clauses create only a presumption. After all, they are, as this Court has indicated, an aid in determining the intent of a hypothetical Congress. And, here, I would respectfully submit that the presumption is a weak one because, on the one hand, you have a boilerplate severability clause which covers the entirety of the Dodd-Frank Act, and on the other hand, you have very specific indicia in Title X itself, the very -- But the Court said that back in an era when we didn't pay as much attention to the text of the statute, and the text of the statute here has a severability clause. This Court has never treated severability clauses as dispositive, and I think that that is because of the nature of the severability inquiry, which is a hypothetical inquiry.
It's not quite like ordinary statutory interpretation. And, here, I am not just relying on statements in the legislative history.
I'm relying on the text of Title X itself.
And in the very provision creating the CFPB, Congress describes it as an independent Bureau.
There are the other provisions of the CFPB with -- which very unusually insulate the CFPB from the appropriations process. And so, to the extent that this is an inquiry into congressional intent, this Court should have serious pause about going so far as to render this agency subject to complete Presidential control when we know that that's not what the sponsors -- Mr. Shanmugam -- -- of the Dodd-Frank Act wanted. -- your argument rests mostly on this distinction between multi-member and single-member agencies. And I think most people who have been in these agencies or have studied these agencies, have observed these agencies, might say to that distinction that it's -- it's kind of simplistic, that it all depends, that there are so many contingencies involved as to which kind of agency a President might have more effective influence over that one simply can't make a general statement of that kind. You know, there are voting rules. There are rules about whether there's a weak chair or a strong chair.
There are rules about holdover commissioners.
There are a thousand things that go into whether a President has influence over any particular agency, of which the question is it one or multiple members is not so important. Yeah, please, spend a couple of sentences. Great.
Thank you. I'm happy to turn to the merits for a minute. (Laughter.) On Humphrey's Executor, which is really the primary case on which amicus relies, I think we're all here trying to make sense of Humphrey's Executor, knowing that, in Morrison, this Court essentially disemboweled the reasoning of that case.
And I think that it is at least implicit in Humphrey's Executor that the Court was focused on the fact that the FTC was a multi-member commission and, as we explain, ex ante, recognizing that there are variations in how multi-member commissions are structured. We believe that multi-member commissions pose a much lower threat to individual liberty and give Presidents a somewhat greater degree of control. And so our fundamental submission on the constitutional merits here is that the Court can plausibly limit Humphrey's Executor to that context.
If the Court does not accept that distinction, then I think it is squarely presented with the question of whether to overrule Humphrey's Executor. Thank -- But we don't believe that the Court needs to reach that question. Thank you, counsel. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As a general rule, the President has the unrestricted authority to remove principal officers.
Humphrey's Executor recognizes an exception for multi-member commissions, but that shouldn't be extended to single-headed agencies for two reasons. First, there would be no coherent limiting principle.
The only difference between the FTC and most cabinet agencies is the multi-member structure.
If that's irrelevant, then Congress could presumably impose for-cause removal restrictions on almost the entire cabinet, from Treasury to the EPA. Second, that, in turn, would sever executive power from political accountability. The President stands for election.
The director of the CFPB does not.
So, if the director is insulated from presidential oversight, then her exercises of executive power are insulated from democratic control.
And that's not the structure that our Constitution creates and requires. Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to initially address the meaning of the for-cause removal standard -- Before -- -- because you -- -- before you do that, may I ask, isn't it uncommon for the Department of Justice not to defend a statute passed by Congress? How often has the SG declined to defend legislation adopted by Congress? Your Honor, I don't have the precise number, but the general rule is that we defend the acts of Congress unless it infringes upon the President's own executive power.
And, here, we believe that we have a statute that infringes upon the President's own executive power. Has that been the position of the Department of Justice, or is this a new position? I believe that that is the long-standing position of the Department of Justice, that the general presumption that we will defend acts of Congress has an exception built in when the act of Congress infringes upon the President's own executive power.
And that's what we have here. I mean in this particular context, in the -- in the context of a restriction on the President's removal power. Your Honor, I -- I don't know the exact answer to that question.
I believe, although I'd want to double-check on this, that in Bowsher, the executive branch did not defend the removal restriction that was at issue.
I believe in Free Enterprise Fund, they did defend the removal restriction at issue. I cannot recall what their position was in Humphrey's Executor.
In Myers, I don't believe they defended the removal restriction that Congress had enacted.
But -- General, isn't it true that the Department of Justice has refused to defend the constitutionality of other federal statutes even when the President's removal power is not at issue? Yes, Your Honor. I am simply -- For example, the Defense of Marriage Act? All I'm simply saying is that our general rule is that there is a presumption that we will defend acts of Congress when arguments can reasonably be made in their -- in their defense.
And there's obviously room to -- in the joints there, but there is an exception to even that presumption when the President's own powers are at stake. And, Mr. Chief Justice, as to the scope of the for-cause removal restriction, we think that the one thing that it cannot be interpreted to allow is the President to remove a principal officer simply because he has lost faith in their judgment or simply because, even though the current principal officer is perfectly good, he thinks he can do better. And we think that's critical because the President cannot personally exercise all executive power.
So the way that he does it is he puts in place people who have his implicit trust, and then he is fully accountable for their decisions precisely because he can remove them for any reason. And the problem with these for-cause removal restrictions is that they vest executive power in an individual who is not ultimately -- The -- what I've always thought -- and I don't -- I would like a -- what I've always thought -- and these cases are hard to put in boxes, but, look, the reason Taft could -- could remove the postmaster is because, at that time, a postmaster was a political plum and the President is a politician and, therefore, there is no good reason to stop him from controlling political plums. The reason they couldn't in Humphrey's Executor is because this is meant to be an independent board.
And Frankfurter explains it well in Myers.
He says, if you have an agency that has something of an adjudicative function, you need to keep him insulated. Now, once we depart from that kind of thing, trying to figure out what works -- a workable government, says the Constitution, certainly by implication -- it's impossible. What about the Fed? What about the FCC? The only thing you can say about those is there are very strong reasons for giving them some independence in terms of the workability of their function.
Now that notion, case by case, look at it.
I haven't been able to find another. You want another standard.
You obviously think there's another standard. Well, I -- I'd offer you two responses to that, Your Honor. First of all, I think you can leave Humphrey's Executor exactly where it is, applying to multi-member commissions, and you don't call into question any of the current multi-member commissions. But the second and more critical point is, once you make that leap away from multi-member commissions, there's no real clear limiting principle since there's no -- But why -- why is it -- why should it make a difference? It seems the President is hemmed in even more if, for every one of those people, he can't remove them at whim.
I --- I don't understand why it doesn't go the other way. So there's one head, but, with the multi-member, that each time every one of them, the President can't do what he wants. Right, and for -- for two reasons, Your Honor.
The first is the point that I was just making to Justice Breyer. Once you make that leap to single-headed agencies, then Congress could impose a for-cause removal restriction just like the one in Humphrey's Executor on most of the cabinet, and that would be a wholesale revolution in separation-of-powers principles. Well, maybe cabinet officials are different from the -- from an agency that Congress tries to make independent both of itself and of the President to some extent. I mean, cabinet members are loyal to the President.
They carry out the President's policy in areas where the President has the authority.
It's -- cabinet officials are not like what Congress tried to create here, some -- an agency that is independent of both -- Uh-huh. -- branches of government. And, Your Honor, that goes to my second point.
This Court has made clear that separation-of-powers principles requires high walls and clear distinctions precisely because low walls and vague distinct -- distinctions aren't judicially enforceable. Well, actually, I mean, I don't know that you can say anything additionally, but it's a very basic question. You have a document, and the document has to work.
And different judges in this Court have taken somewhat different approaches. Uh-huh. But the approach of -- of workability in terms of what Congress wanted and the other provisions does not lead you to a clear standard. You are offering a clear standard, but my problem is, why that one? I mean -- Sure. -- how long will that last? And -- and -- and it's -- I don't know if there's anything you can add, but you see -- you see where I'm coming from? Well, I would like to add something, Your Honor -- Yeah. -- because I do think that we're offering a very clear standard, and at the same time, I would like to finish responding to Justice Ginsburg's point, because the cabinet is nowhere defined.
The cabinet is simply a matter of tradition. The reason why particular agencies are in the cabinet is typically because they're removable at will.
But, once you say that you can impose at will -- for-cause removal restrictions on agencies that are functionally no different than the -- the FTC, other than in their multi-member structure, you really no longer have defined a limit on when Congress can impose a similar restriction. And if you go down that road, Your Honor, you can effectively saddle every new President with his predecessor's cabinet, much like this administration was saddled -- I -- I'm not sure -- -- with his predecessor's head of the CFPB. I'm not sure, General, that you responded to the part of Justice Ginsburg's question which, again, focused on -- on this principal argument that you're making, which is the multi-member versus the single-member. And I think she was saying that even if you could make a generalization, which I think that there are problems with, but even if you can make a generalization, it cuts the other way, that a multi-member commission, just because it diffuses power, is much dif -- much more difficult to influence.
You know -- Right. -- if a President can get one person on the phone, that's a lot easier than if he has to worry about seven people who are all doing their own thing.
And -- and so in just the -- the -- the basic understandings of one person, easy to influence, more accountable, even if you can't influence him, you can point at him, why isn't a single-member agency better? Sure.
So my first answer to that is, even if I assumed, for the sake of argument, that what you were saying was right, and I don't agree with it, I don't think it would matter, because the rationale of Humphrey's Executor is that the for-cause removal restriction was allowed because the agency was quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. And by that, I think what the Court meant was that it was a multi-member body that acted through deliberation and consensus.
And that rationale simply doesn't apply to single-headed agencies, even if you thought it was the same diminution of power. If I could give you an example to help illustrate the point based on Morrison against Olson.
I doubt -- I very much doubt this Court would uphold an independent counsel statute that was trained in on the investigation of private individuals, even if it were a very small number of private individuals and even if this Court thought it resulted in less of a diminution of executive power than the independent counsel statute at issue in Morrison, precisely because the rationale for Morrison wouldn't apply. There wouldn't be the need to prevent the perceived conflict of interest when the Executive Branch investigates itself.
So even if you thought it was a lesser diminution of executive power, because the rationale of Humphrey's Executor doesn't apply, it wouldn't justify the extension of Humphrey's. But now I'd like to address also why I disagree with your fundamental point. The first is the no limiting principle point, and I'm not going to go further into that because I've already said it. The second is multi-member commissions actually in my view represent less of a threat to liberty precisely because they are multi-member bodies that act through deliberation and consensus, and that restrains the exercise of their power. For a single-headed agency, often the only restraint on the exercise of power is a political or democratic accountability restraint.
And once you remove that, you've now vested enormous executive power in somebody who is not subject to the procedural constraint that multi-member commissions have and are not subject to the political constraint that everyone else has. So what strikes me about a lot of these arguments in the brief and here, you're saying, you know, this is the better way to promote liberty, to protect liberty. I mean, traditionally, there's been a long history of saying that it's actually the political branch's decision as to which is the best way to promote liberty, that there -- this is a constitution that does not say anything about removal.
It does not say anything about for cause or at will or anything else. Indeed, it doesn't say anything very much about the structure or organization of the government in general.
It essentially allows it to Congress, with the President, the President has to sign these laws, to decide which institutions of governance and which modes of governance are best to promote liberty and to serve the public interest. And I don't know how to make these decisions.
They're contested.
They're contestable as to what independence and what form of accountability and what form of Presidential control is appropriate. Why don't we just leave it to the political branches, who actually know about these things? For a couple of reasons, Your Honor.
And the first thing I'd say is I -- I do think the Constitution specifically addresses this question, though not in so many words. And what I'd point you to is exactly what this Court said in the Free Enterprise Fund case.
The view that prevailed, talking about the decision of 1789, as most consonant to the text of the Constitution, was that the executive power included a power to oversee executive officers through removal. Now, as to your liberty point, the reason why I don't think that the courts leave this just to the executive branches is because the purpose of separation of powers is not to protect the President from Congress or to protect Congress from the President but to protect the liberty of the people by enforcing the structural constraints of our Constitution. And the key structural constraint at issue here is the one set forth in Article II, that the executive power shall be vested in a President and that he shall take care that the laws will be faithfully executed. The only way he can do that is if he's fully accountable for the decisions of his principal officers.
And the problem with these for-cause removal restrictions is that they vest executive power in individuals who are not ultimately accountable to the people through their duly elected President. Is your argument stronger or weaker when you look at the budgetary constraints? I mean, does the independence of the agency from the budgetary process further weaken the democratic accountability through the President, or does it give him at least some say in the agency's functioning? Well, Your Honor, respectfully, I think that that gives the President less control, but that's not the focus of our argument. Ultimately, it's the President's duty to oversee the Executive Branch through the removal power, not Congress's duty to oversee the Executive Branch through the appropriations power.
So I think it marginally -- that -- that additional insulation marginally helps us, but I wouldn't rely -- How much -- -- on that here. -- how much does it matter that the tenure of the single director continues into the next President's term? Because I think that's when the problem really reveals itself, that the next President is going to have to deal for his or her whole term, potentially, with a CFPB director appointed by this President and will not be able to supervise or direct that person, even if that President has a wildly different conception of consumer financial protection? Right.
I think that helps illustrate the fundamental nature of the problem in that.
And it -- and it doesn't just have to do with timing.
If you've got a President and a Senate of the same political party, they could also game the system by just putting in place a new CFPB director at the very end of the President's term.
So I think that -- The current -- -- exacerbates the problem. -- the current director will go to the end of 2023, correct? Right. So the first three years of the next term. I think that illustrates the nature of the problem, Your Honor.
Even if you didn't have that, I still think this for-cause removal restriction -- But, I mean, Justice -- -- would be unconstitutional. -- Kavanaugh raises a -- a really interesting point here because the Court has been so focused, all our cases, on removal.
But removal is really not the thing that -- if you wanted to pick one thing, you would pick appointments as -- as -- as reflective of whether a President will have control or not control over a particular person. So, you know, it's appointments.
It's length of term.
There are so many things that go into the question of Presidential control. Removal has historically been very difficult for Presidents to exercise as a way of controlling people, because the people you want to remove the most, there are all kinds of political constraints about why you shouldn't remove them. So removal is like a nuclear bomb. There are all kinds of things that actually figure in how much control a President has over an individual that have nothing to do with removal.
Why is it that we've picked this one thing as the sine qua non of Article II? Because, respectfully, Your Honor, I would very much disagree with the entire premise of your point. And I point you to this Court's decision in Bowsher, where the Court wrote that once an officer is appointed, it is only the authority that can remove him and not the authority that appointed him that he must fear and in the performance of his duties obey. And as this Court made clear in the Free Enterprise Fund case, the removal power is the principal power that the President uses not only to supervise the Executive Branch but to ultimately be held accountable to the people, which is, after all, the whole point. I would like to address the severability issue, which is very important to the government.
If the Court doesn't address the severability clause, as my friend has suggested, then there really is a cloud hanging over everything that the CFPB does. If, as we contend, the removal restriction is unconstitutional and if it is inseverable from the remainder of the statute, then everything that the CFPB does is invalid and they don't even have the authority to ratify the CID here. So we think it's critical that the Court address that question.
And I would also respectfully submit that it is a very easy question in this case in view of the clear and unambiguous severability clause. There's no need to engage in this navel-gazing, what would Congress have done had it considered the issue, because Congress has answered that question. Well, Mr. Shanmugam said to look at all the provisions of the statute, and those reveal an intent that is distinct from the severability clause. So can you respond to his point on that? Yes.
Two responses, a specific one and a general one. On the specific one, he points to a provision that simply refers to the CFPB as an independent Bureau.
All that really means is that while it's housed under the umbrella of the Federal Reserve, it is independent of the Federal Reserve Board.
It is a separate and independent agency just like, you know, the Department of Education is a separate and independent agency. But, in any event, there is nothing that they point to that can overcome the clear and unambiguous text of a severability clause that says, if any provision is found unconstitutional, then the remainder of the statute shall remain intact. Well, I -- I take your point about the severability clause, but if what you say is true, then what would be the justification for this Court's statements in other cases that a severability clause like this is not necessarily dispositive? Well, Your Honor, first of all, I point to what Justice Kavanaugh was alluding to.
That was -- those cases are often from an earlier era.
But I will put that wholly to the side because, at the very least, it is a strong presumption.
And it's a presumption can -- that can be overcome only if there is an internal statutory conflict, if, for example, severing a provision would render the statutory scheme incoherent. Here, one of Congress's principal purposes was to take a consumer protection function that was spread out across multiple agencies and concentrate it into a single agency because it thought that would lead to better and more effective enforcement. May I have one more sentence? One more. And by severing the for-cause removal restriction, you leave fully intact that concentrated enforcement mechanism. Thank you, General. Mr. Clement. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Text, first principles, and precedent all support the validity of the removal provision at issue here.
Nonetheless, the parties are in violent agreement that the provision is unconstitutional. Moreover, they are eager, indeed hungry, to borrow a phrase from Justice Scalia's Windsor opinion, to have this Court decide the constitutional issue on which they agree. But, if they agree, it's reasonable to ask, why doesn't the government give Petitioner what it wants and drop the CID? Ah, but there's the rub. The President and the Executive Branch acting through the President does not want the CID dropped, which is why the acting director, when he was removable at will, ratified the investigatory demand here and told the Ninth Circuit that that ratification was an independent, non-constitutional basis to resolve the entire case. The Solicitor General, at page 22 of his reply brief, continues to argue that the ratification precludes any relief for the Petitioner.
Yet, he insists that this Court should decide the constitutional question because the parties somehow agreed at the cert stage that ratification would be saved for the Ninth Circuit. Thus, this is a case, unlike Windsor, for example, where the lack of adverseness between the parties is fundamentally distorting this Court's ability to do its job and its general preference to decide cases on non-constitutional grounds rather -- rather than wading into difficult constitutional questions. There is a phrase that aptly describes what the Solicitor General wants from this Court, and it's an advisory opinion.
And this Court lacks jurisdiction to issue it. But, if this Court were to reach the merits, it should affirm the decision below and the constitutionality of a removal provision that uses the same familiar phrase that this Court has approved on other occasions and leaves the removal power with the President, which avoids the principal defect in this Court's cases. My friends want to describe this Court's precedents as providing a general rule of illimitable presidential removal power subject only to a narrow exception for multi-member commissions. With all due respect, that is wishful thinking.
The general rule that describes all of this Court's cases is that the Congress cannot assign the President's removal authority elsewhere -- Mr. Clement -- -- whether to Congress -- -- I -- I -- I understand your point about ratification.
I -- I think if -- if the other side were to have an opportunity to respond, they might say something like this: That we don't normally decide questions in the first instance that haven't yet been adjudicated below.
We're a court of review, not first view, I think is the phrase I often hear. What -- what would you say to that? I would say, Justice Gorsuch, that might be a reason to dismiss this case as improvidently -- So you're arguing -- you're really arguing that we should DIG the case? I -- I -- I'd say, if the choices are DIG the case -- That's your first argument? -- or decide -- well, it's -- it's not strictly a DIG argument.
The way I would think about it is this Court in Windsor, over a strong dissent by at least three justices, said that it could decide that case jurisdictionally even though there was a lack of adverseness between the parties.
But even the majority was concerned with that lack of adverseness between the parties, and it suggested there was a prudential test and you look for whether there was a prudential reason to decide the case or not to decide the case. Here, I think there is, with respect, the mother of all prudential reasons not to decide this case, which is -- So I think the answer to the question is yes, right? You'd DIG the case? No.
I -- I would -- That's your first choice, the prudential -- mother of all prudential reasons not to decide it, I would take that to mean we should DIG it, no? No, Mr. Justice Gorsuch, I think you should write a fine opinion that vindicates much of the reasoning of the dissenters in Windsor but -- but reconciles it with the majority.
And it's not a DIG.
It's a jurisdictional opinion, and it says adverseness is vitally important to Article III, and it's vitally important especially when the lack of adverseness could cause this Court to unnecessarily decide a constitutional question. Boy -- boy, that sounds a lot like a DIG, but, okay, fine. (Laughter.) Let -- on -- on the merits, what do we do with the fact -- and I'm sure you've given this great thought -- that if we were to approve single-member agencies without any presidential removal power -- let's just suppose that -- we would run into questions about the cabinet, for example, which are just agencies, right? So what -- how would you have the Court write an opinion to distinguish this case from that? So I -- I -- I want to be responsive, but I want to point out that I don't think -- Great. But -- but just to point out for starters, you don't avoid drawing a line by adopting the Solicitor General's position. I understand that. Okay.
Because I don't think -- But now if you could answer my question. Sure.
So I would draw it the same place I think he would draw it.
So I don't think he said -- would say that you can eliminate the State Department by creating a multi-member commission on foreign affairs. That's not my question, Mr. Clement.
If you could answer my question, I'd be grateful. I -- I am -- with all due -- My question is, what if Congress tomorrow revived the Tenure of Office Act, all right -- Well -- -- and said presidents can't remove without a whole bunch of conditions, not Senate approval, okay, but something else that looks a lot like that. Wouldn't that be a problem with the Constitution? Absolutely. Okay.
Then -- then how do we distinguish this case from that one? So I think there's two -- I offer you two limiting principles, which I think is two more than the Solicitor General's offered you.
But here's the first: The first is -- If we could avoid disparaging our colleagues and just answer my question, I would be grateful. First, there is a structural limitation.
So they can't put somebody essentially in the cabinet or in the White House staff and then have that person subject to for-cause removal. Second, there's a constitutional backstop, an absolute constitutional backstop, which is those authorities that the Constitution assigns directly to the President -- so the State Department, the Defense Department, pardon power; there's a few others -- those cannot be subject under any circumstances to anything other than at-will removal. How about the -- And I didn't mean to disparage my colleague.
I was just saying the same limiting principle ultimately has to be in place for multi-member commissions. How about the EPA or Homeland Security? So I -- I think EPA is something that they probably could make subject to for-cause removal.
I think Homeland Security, in its current form, they couldn't, because some of the powers that were given to the Homeland Security Secretary by Congress were powers that were borrowed from the Defense Department. And I think, if any of the authorities that are being exercised by a cabinet secretary are authorities that the Constitution assigns directly to the President, you probably can't make that subject to -- Well, what is your definition of a cabinet secretary? I would take the definition, for these purposes, directly from 5 U.S.C. 101.
That's where Congress defines the 15 executive departments.
They are the 15 executive departments that are in the line of succession.
I -- that's -- that would be my place.
And I -- Those -- those change from time to time, right? Relatively rarely.
I mean, the last time we had one added was the Department of Homeland Security. Right. And -- and -- and my point is a structural one that works with a constitutional backstop.
The point is Congress can't sort of try to have it both ways and say we don't really want this person to be independent; we just want to sort of hamstring the President. But, ultimately, there is a constitutional backstop, and I think it's the same backstop that you would have to eventually put in place for multi-member commissions.
And based on -- Well, I -- I -- that's when you -- you began by saying that was a narrow exception that the Solicitor General adopts.
Why is that? I mean, most of these agencies are multi-member commissions, and they seem -- most of the more significant ones are multi-member commissions -- agencies or commissions.
I would have thought that's a fairly significant exception. Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the Solicitor General described it as a narrow exception.
It's -- it's however broad it is.
I don't think, though, it's a coherent place to draw the line. And that's because, if you think of what the agencies are doing as exercising executive power -- and I don't think there's any other way to think about them -- and this is how Chief Justice Rehnquist thought about them in Morrison.
If they are exercising executive power, then this Court has held for nearly a century that you can have principal officers exercising executive power subject to inefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance removal provisions.
So there isn't some absolute sort of prohibition on that. Then the question is, is there something sacrosanct about a multi-member commission? And the answer, I would think for purposes of this argument, is absolutely not. And, actually, if the constitutional problem is that somebody is exercising the executive power with a for-cause removal restriction, I think it's more problematic if they're subject not just to for-cause removal but a multi-member requirement and a partisan balance requirement. But -- but Congress has always established these as multi-member commissions or agencies, and as the Free Enterprise Fund decision said, and as Noel Canning said in a different context, recess appointments, Justice Breyer's opinion, that historical practice at some point becomes an important aspect of how we define or draw the line.
So what do we do with that historical practice here? Well, I -- I think what you do is you take the historical practice as a given, so you don't overrule Humphrey's Executor, despite the invitation to do so, but then you think: Okay, now we confront something that's different, not completely unprecedented, we've had four of them spanning about 30 years, but you confront something new.
And then you say, is this different in kind? And here's -- on the different in kind, just how this will play out if you were to win, it's really the next President who's going to face the issue, because a -- the head of this agency will go at least three or four years into the next President's term, and the next President might have a completely different conception of consumer financial regulatory issues yet will be able to do nothing about it. And this director -- and that's different from the FCC and the FTC and the NLRB and you name the rest, because the chair is redesignated by the new President when the President comes in.
That happens with all the -- or almost all the multi-member agencies. So -- so how do we deal with that real-world consequence that seems different and troubling? So two points, Justice Kavanaugh.
First, I don't know that's different with respect to many of the important agencies and I point, for example, to the Fed. I don't think the President has the ability to just change who's the chair of the Fed as soon as they walk into office.
And they may not even be able to make an appointment to the Fed for a couple of years.
And so I think, as Justice Kagan alluded to, there is a number of different forms of multi-member agency. But, second, I think that gets to the question that the Chief Justice asked earlier in the argument, which is it depends a little bit about what inefficient -- what inefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance mean. I mean, if that's something that basically means that you have to have a very high standard before you can remove somebody, then maybe there is more of a constraint in that situation.
If it means something slightly less, there may be less of a constraint and you're not drawing on a blank slate in that regard. My friends on the -- But if we -- -- other side act as if this -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but if we -- if we water down the standard, as you're suggesting, of what it takes to remove an independent agency head, that would apply across the board and actually would be a broad hold -- holding that would make the FCC, the FTC, NLRB less independent. I -- I -- I think it depends.
I mean, if you're interpreting those terms to avoid a constitutional problem and the particular constitutional problem you just articulated, then I don't think it necessarily follows that those same terms would be watered down in the context of a multi -- Well -- What about -- What about the -- (Laughter.) What about the -- what about the budgetary consequences? I mean, your -- your friend on the other side refers to this individual, the head, as sort of like, you know, the effective President over the significant swath of the economy. But, with the budgetary things, it's actually more powerful than that.
I mean, they don't even have to go to Congress to get -- to get their money.
Isn't that something that we should factor into the substantive question on his removability? Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that actually cuts in our favor because that means that the officer is less responsive to Congress and, therefore, however responsive they would otherwise be to the President, they don't have to dilute that by trying to worry about what they're going to say to the appropriators when they go up and talk to the appropriators. And I think that the Solicitor General referred to the Bowsher opinion.
I think the Bowsher opinion is helpful for us for two reasons: First, it interprets inefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance in a way that I think, if applied to this statute, would make it constitutional. But, second, it also points out that the critical principle is that an officer is drawn kind of in a magnetic way to the individual that has the ability to remove them. And, here, unlike Bowsher, unlike Myers, and even unlike Free Enterprise, the person that gets to remove the director is the President.
So the director has to be to some degree, even when there's a change of administration, responsive to the President. On your -- on your definition of how we should apply the standard or water it down, is what I said, would it be enough for the President to say: I don't feel that your mind and my mind go along together on the policies or administering of the agency? I -- I don't know that that would be enough, Your Honor, but I do think if a President said, look, I think it's an important priority for consumer finance protection that we deal with, let's just say, pay day lenders or some problem that's out there and the director said absolutely not, I think you could, especially if you're trying -- That's what -- that's what President Roosevelt said to Humphrey. No, no, what -- what you said is what -- Yeah, I know -- -- he said to Humphrey. -- but what you're saying is -- No -- -- really the same thing. -- I -- I -- I don't think it is what he said.
And, I mean, keep in mind, in Humphrey, you had those terms, but you upheld the constitutionality of the statute. Yes.
But what's the difference if we water it down to something approaching at will? What's the difference between that and overruling Humphrey and being honest about what we're doing, Mr. Clement? Well, two things, Your Honor.
I mean, first, in every other context I'm aware of, if you have one path that says we interpret the Constitution -- the statute to avoid the constitutional problem, or we can strike it down, you favor the non-constitutional ruling. Yes.
But what you're doing is equating the two.
If it winds up being at will, then that is Humphrey. With due -- all -- all due respect, I think that there's -- it's still a difference, whatever the standard is.
Maybe it -- maybe it allows something like sort of a broad-standing policy disagreement but not disagreeing with individual cases. A broad-standing -- But that's -- -- policy disagreement versus a policy disagreement in a particular case? I'm sorry, Chief.
I'm not sure what the difference would be. Well, one is I want you to go after pay day lending.
The other is I don't like what you did in that particular adjudication.
I do think there's -- Well, but that's worse than -- that's worse than Humphrey because what's going to happen is that there will be litigation over whether or not the standard has been met or not met. I mean, we begin with the idea of a serious conflict between the President and the agency director.
And if then we're saying, well, the standard is more flexible, it sounds to me like that's a dispute that's going to be presented to the courts, which would be the worst of all possible worlds. Well, I -- I -- I -- no, I think it would -- first of all, I don't think it would be the worst of all possible worlds because it would be a concrete live dispute. And, of course, as you suggested, you could provide a degree of deference. But I do think it's important there would still be a big difference between a restriction that applied however you interpret it and at will, because at will -- Well, let me ask this in concrete terms.
So let's say that the -- the director is appointed by a prior President and the new President says: I want to remove you because I think you are too pro-consumer and you're hurting the economy, or you are not sufficiently protecting consumer interests. Would that be permissible? I -- I -- I don't know for sure because I don't have a concrete controversy here, and that's maybe just yet another reason to not decide this case in its current artificial posture.
But I guess if you told me -- Well, that's exactly -- that's all we -- that's all we know about it. There's just a policy disagreement about the way interests are balanced. Would that be sufficient to just -- to remove that person? If the only alternative is to strike the statute down, I would say that's sufficient. Now I will confess I don't think that's what Congress had in mind when it put those words in this particular statute.
And I think, as written, it's still perfectly constitutional. I'm just saying -- said in every other context, the rule this Court applies is we interpret the statute to make it more constitutional, not less constitutional -- Mister -- -- just so we can strike it down. -- Mr. Clement, can you say or explain what your counter is to the buck stops here argument? There seems to be an overriding assumption that somehow the President needs unfettered discretion to execute the laws.
Why is that -- answer that argument head on. So I don't think that that's true as a constitutional matter with respect to every power the President exercises. I think Congress has the power to say there are certain things where we want the President to have a role, but we also want it somewhat insulated from politics. So take the Fed, for example.
We don't want the President to juice up interest rates right before a presidential election, so we're going to give that to somebody who is insulated.
How insulated depends on what's constitutionally permissible.
But not every statutory responsibility needs to be conducted by the President himself. In the current situation, you see people are trying to make a political football out of dealing with a pandemic disease.
So maybe Congress decides: You know what makes sense, let's have the head of CDC be protected by for-cause removal because that'll make sure people get good advice and it doesn't become political.
That is the kind of sensible decision that Congress has been making for over 100 years. Now it gave that responsibility, that important responsibility to the Fed, protected by for-cause removal 100 years ago. Now it happened to be a multi-member Board of Governors, but I don't think anything turned on that.
As the House makes clear in their amicus brief, at no point did Congress ever put multi-member restrictions in there or for -- or -- or bipartisan requirements in there to give the President greater control. Although the reality is diverse, as a general matter, if you add multi-member requirements and partisan balance requirements to for-cause removal requirements, you make the officers more insulated, not less insulated. But the buck stops -- So more insulated -- -- the buck stops here quote was quoted in our recent decision in Free Enterprise.
Do you think that that should -- that recent precedent should have a binding -- binding effect on how the Court addresses this case? May I answer? (Laughter.) No.
Yes, you may. (Laughter.) Mr. Chief Justice, we think Free Enterprise Fund helps us in two ways. One, it made crystal-clear that the defect there is that the removal power was taken away from the President.
And what you found to be sufficient to give the President control there was the ability to remove the SEC commissioners for cause. The second thing you said later in the opinion is that the SEC itself, the whole multi-member commission, could actually function as a head of the Department. So that's -- in an Appointments Clause context, it's a way of saying the difference between a single member and a multi-member doesn't make a constitutional difference. Thank you, counsel. May I -- may I just ask one question? Mr. Shanmugam said there was no proof of ratification. Well, I -- I don't know what he means by that.
The -- the acting -- in a brief that said that it was essentially endorsed by the acting director at a time when the acting director was in charge and at-will removable by the President, told the Ninth Circuit that the acting director had ratified the decision to issue the CID in that context, I would take that, as in any other context, as all the evidence you need. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Letter. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin just by saying the Speaker of the House thanks the Court for its courtesy in agreeing to let the House be heard here today. I'd like to start out, if I could, by responding to Justice Gorsuch's question to my friend, Mr. Clement, about do we want the Court to DIG the case.
No.
We think that the Court should affirm on alternative grounds because, as we have pointed out, there are -- there are two reasons why this Court's venerable doctrine with which the House completely agrees, about avoidance of constitutional issues, one is the ratification point that we've been discussing, and two is the severability point, which this Court, in cases like Matthews and Chadha, has indicated you -- you can look at first, initially. And, here, the severability point, we think, is absolutely clear because of the severability -- severability clause, but, in addition, there's a -- there's another point that I wanted to -- to make that hasn't yet been said. If this -- if there is no severability here, I want to make sure that you all understand this is not a simple -- you know, a situation of, well, we'll just have these functions go back to the other agencies that -- where they came from.
They came from seven different agencies. The Office of Thrift Supervision no longer exists.
The other agencies don't have either slots or appropriations to enforce what the -- the CFPB does.
So, if you say this is non-severable, we strike down the whole statute, in this instance, that would be a very, very major action. Mr. -- Mr. Letter, are you quite concerned about the agency taking away your client's authority over the budget with respect to this very significant part of the economy? We are not, Your Honor, because this is something that Congress has done with several agencies in the financial regulatory sectors, for example, the -- the Fed, in particular, the National Credit Union Administration. So this is a -- a function that -- oh, I'm sorry, the FDIC.
This is a -- this is something that Congress has done and -- and the President, so the political branches have done in -- in different -- in different agencies within this financial regulatory sector. As far as one of the things I'd like to pick up on also is Justice Kagan's point or question about is it really so -- so simple about agencies with multi-members or individual -- an individual.
And -- and I note, Justice -- as Judge Kavanaugh, you wrote extensively on the influence, but I'm going to try to press hard and convince you otherwise. The -- the situation here is, if the President were to try to, by removals, influence the kinds of functions that the CFPB did, does, he'd have to make removals possibly from seven different agencies, any number of individuals. And then the -- the point that was made about, well, there haven't been many removals, it's a big deal: It is a big deal, and that's why there have been almost no removals. In fact, what we know from history is presidents have all sorts of ways that they influence agencies, and they influence agency commissioners or heads, just as, for example, sometimes you might have a situation where a President convinces a Supreme Court justice to leave that post and -- Well, what do you have -- do you want to add anything on what I think is quite basic, and people disagree? On the one hand, you have people -- good walls make good neighbors, let's look for a line, multi versus single or some other line. The other is the approach there's something about me that doesn't like a wall, and before I want to have a wall, I want to know what I'm walling in and walling out.
And that looks to function.
What did Congress have in mind? How does it wall in the President? What is it exactly the agency is doing? The difficulty of that, of course, is there is no strict line, and the courts have to approach it without knowing too much about it case by case. Do you have anything you want to say on what I'd call that basic difference of approach in these cases? Yes, Your Honor, and -- and you're absolutely right, this is a basic difference here. The -- the point is that we -- we do not agree -- I do not agree with Mr. Clement's argument that we should water down the standard. But we definitely agree, the House believes -- and notice the House has not tried to have cabinet members be anything other than at will. And I think my friend, Mr. Clement, hit on a very key provision.
One is the succession, that cabinet members who are in the succession, not all cabinet members are -- succession to the President -- but, two, the basic independent powers that the President has because of the Constitution. So it's not just the Defense Department, as -- as my -- So where -- I'm sorry. -- would you draw the line, Mr. Letter, then? If -- I guess I have two questions for you.
First, if -- if the standard isn't watered down, what does that standard mean for removal in your mind? And, number two, what would be the stopping point for Congress's ability to place high levels, serious impediments to presidential removal powers of -- of members of the cabinet and other executive -- what we think of traditionally as executive agencies? Your Honor, I'm going to start with the second one.
I don't know the answer of how far Congress could -- could go, Congress and the President together could go. Isn't that a pretty vital question for us to be able to answer to decide this case? I don't think so, Your Honor, because you have decided in Humphrey's Executor, Wiener, Buckley, Free Enterprise, Morrison versus Olson, you've decided all of those cases and you've said that removal protections are constitutional without answering that question. I -- I searched in vain.
In none of those decisions have you -- No, fair enough. But you're at the podium, so take a shot at it. (Laughter.) They -- I'm going to pick up on a word that -- that I believe this Court has used, which is they should be modest.
I think the test is, Your Honor, what -- again, this Court has said, I believe it's in Morrison, but you've said it in various situations, is it -- does it so interfere with the executive's ability to carry out his constitutional responsibilities? I think that's the test that this Court has -- has said in a variety of separation-of-powers cases.
I know that's -- that's vague, but I can't do better than what -- what you have said. What -- what do you do about -- Well -- I -- I -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Go ahead. I'm sorry.
I hope you'll get to my first question at some point, but I -- No, go ahead.
Go ahead first. Justice Gorsuch, would you mind repeating your first question? I apologize. Sure.
What does that removal standard mean to you? If -- if we shouldn't water it down, what does it mean? Your Honor -- and, again, I'm going to agree with Mr. Clement insofar as this.
A lot of times, this is going to depend on context. So, for example, and -- and, again, this Court hasn't defined what it means, so I don't have a great answer yet from you all.
You tell us what the Constitution -- Your client wrote it.
So I'm -- I'm just wondering what your client's view is.
And you say you disagreed with Mr. Clement on this, and now you say you agree.
So I'm really quite confused. I -- I disagree with Mr. Clement about watering it down.
We don't think that it should be made basically at will. But the -- I -- I will agree -- I don't think Mr. Clement said that either. Oh, I -- I apologize.
I thought he was saying a watered-down version. But, Justice Kagan, I will very strongly agree with Mr. Clement.
It does depend on the -- the circumstances. For example, if a President says, I'm -- I'm firing you because you are investigating one of my big political donors, and I don't like that, so you're gone, I don't think that anybody would feel that that fits within the IMN standard. So what if the President just says we don't agree on policy? Would that be permitted? I don't believe -- I think in Free Enterprise, I believe you said no. So -- so I think you've already answered that. If -- So -- so we don't always think about the future implications of these things, but that's one of the things I've tried to think about. Yes. The next President in 2021 or 2025 or whenever will have to deal with a CFPB director appointed by the prior President potentially for his or her whole term without being able -- given your answer to Justice Alito -- being able to do anything about that difference in policy. Are you comfortable with that result? Does that give you any concern? Should we be concerned about that? It does give me concerns, but -- and I'm -- I'm very glad you brought that up because you've asked that and it's a very key question, Your Honor. What I would say, though, is let's compare it to, for example -- may I finish my -- Sure. If you compare it to, for instance, the Fed, that has seven members who serve 14-year terms.
A President who serves a four-year term is, therefore, very likely to have almost no influence over the Fed.
They won't -- I've not -- I'm not a good mathematician, but I don't think that means that they get to come anywhere close to appointing a majority of the Fed members. So this is a problem that you have already decided to -- to recognize. Mr. Letter, I think Justice Gorsuch's first question is still on the table. As I said, what we -- Thank you. -- what we think it means will be fact-dependent.
It will depend -- as I say, if it is -- it -- it can't just be we have a policy difference.
You've already -- you've told me that. You've already told me that it can't simply be I don't like you.
We -- we know that. But, for example, if it's a situation where the -- the -- the President says you are doing something that undermines national security, one of my core functions, or undermines foreign relations and I want -- and I direct you to stop, an agency that says -- no, I believe that that would be, Your Honor, cause for -- that would meet the standard. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Your Honor. Two -- two minutes, Mr. Shanmugam. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just three points on jurisdiction, the merits, and the remedy, respectively. On jurisdiction, amicus, who is appointed to defend the judgment below, now seems primarily to be arguing that this Court made a mistake in granting certiorari because of the existence of the ratification question. As a preliminary matter, that was flagged by both sides at the cert stage and this Court, nevertheless, granted review, and I would respectfully submit for good reason. Ratification goes at most to the remedy for the constitutional violation here. And that issue is obviously not briefed before this Court.
It was raised by the government in the Ninth Circuit. But notably, unlike in the other cases involving challenges to the CFPB's constitutionality, the government provided no factual support, no declaration, nothing in support of ratification. I think the ratification is deeply legally problematic here, too, and I would refer the Court to the amicus brief of RD Legal Funding if the Court has questions about that, and ratification wouldn't solve the constitutional problem because, even if the CID itself had been ratified, the continued prosecution of this enforcement action would still present exactly the same constitutional concern. Now, on the merits, amicus disparages the notion that the removal power is illimitable.
Ironically, the Court used exactly that adjective in Humphrey's Executor, at least where agencies are performing executive functions. No one defends the rationale of Humphrey's Executor distinguishing between executive functions and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial functions. And our approach gives meaning to Humphrey's Executor and allows the Court to leave it in place by limiting it to the multi-member context. Amicus's proposed approach by contrast would really create an exception without limit. And the exception cannot be limited to cabinet officers because, for those cabinet officers who exercise enumerated constitutional responsibilities, that's only two, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. All 13 of the other cabinet officers as the cabinet is currently constituted would be removable.
The judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below.
You have ably discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful. The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-6662, Shular versus United States. Mr. Summa. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Shular has prior convictions for drug offenses lacking the mens rea element necessary to distinguish between blameworthy and otherwise innocent conduct. In 1986, one state, North Dakota, had dispensed with the element of guilty knowledge for its drug trafficking crimes.
Today, Florida is the only state lacking a guilty knowledge element.
Florida's law is an aberration. The question here is whether Congress intended convictions under such an aberrational law to support the extreme sentencing enhancement of up to life in prison under ACCA. The answer is no for a variety of reasons. First, the state offense provision presents a list of generic crimes which all include a mens rea element. Second, the text of the state offense provision itself implies a mens rea element irrespective of any generic offense analysis. Third, Congress described the qualifying state offenses by tracking almost verbatim the language of the federal drug trafficking statute.
Congress used the same terms and even in the same order as the federal statute.
We know that when Congress transplants language from one legal source to another, the language carries the old soil with it.
And here the old soil includes a mens rea element. While tracking the federal statute, Congress used the term ""involving"" to sweep in similar crimes described with different terminology, such as promoting, producing, or furnishing a controlled substance.
And Florida uses the term ""sale,"" which we agree comes under the umbrella of the term -- the federal term, ""distribution."" Finally, since Congress legislates against the background of the common law even in the sentencing context, the requirement for prior convictions for felony offenses itself carries a presumption of mens rea for all the serious drug offenses, federal and state, and shows moreover that the state predicate provision is offense-driven and not based upon discrete conduct or activities. That's a summary of our argument, but I can be more specific.
Here we have a phrase ""manufacturing, distribution, possession with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance."" This phrase incorporates well-known drug trafficking crimes under the federal code. And virtually identical language is used to describe the -- the -- the drug trafficking crime -- crimes under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. In 1986, Congress knew that every state had adopted the Uniform Act to a substantial degree.
It is only natural, therefore, that Congress would use this same language to identify drug trafficking offenses and not discrete conduct or activities under the state offense provision. The difference between the Florida statute and the federal statute, as I understand it, is the following, but you'll correct me if I'm wrong: Under the federal statute, the prosecution has to prove that the defendant knew that the substance in question was a controlled substance; whereas under Florida, that is an affirmative defense, so if the defendant raises the affirmative defense, then the state has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew it was a controlled substance. Is that the -- the substance of the difference between the two? Well, I think that's the correct conclusion based upon a Florida jury instruction.
However, even -- in Florida, even if a defendant were to raise that affirmative defense, a verdict of guilty would never, under any circumstance, incorporate a specific finding that the defendant had guilty knowledge because the Florida law also places upon the defendant a burden of production of evidence. Right.
But if -- And -- -- if the affirmative defense is raised, then the situation is the same as it is under federal law? It has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt? That is a reasonable assumption, but the Florida Supreme Court has never actually ruled which party has the burden of -- ultimate burden of proof. But, in any event, I think it was an exaggeration to call this a strict liability crime. It -- it may be an exaggeration.
It depends on how one defines a strict liability crime.
If one says the elements of the offense do not include a mens rea element, then it's a strict liability crime, but many people think if an absence of guilty knowledge is not a defense, that's a strict liability crime. So there's a difference -- Well, there's a mens rea.
You repeatedly say in your brief that there's no mens rea for the Florida defense -- Florida defense.
There is a mens rea.
It's not the mens rea you would like, but there is a mens rea, is there not? You must intend to do the act, right? Yes, but the -- the Florida decisions are clear that the intent of doing the act is -- they do not consider that a mens rea.
It's only if one knows that the substance that is delivered is a controlled substance, that that qualifies as a mens rea of guilty knowledge. What about knowing what you're selling? In -- in other words, doesn't the state have to prove that it was cocaine that was being sold, not sugar? No, Your Honor.
The Florida law is so broad that even the defendant who does not know the substance that was delivered or sold is still guilty. For example -- Because if he -- he has no idea that it's cocaine, he think it's an innocuous substance, the -- the prosecution doesn't have to show that, you say? That's correct, Your Honor. What I think is -- Can I go back to -- -- odd -- odd about this case -- you -- you're claiming the interest of uniformity is served by your approach, and yet in every other state, someone who did exactly what this defendant did would not escape from -- under ACCA, so he gets to avoid ACCA, although he is similarly situated to people in every other state who couldn't. Your Honor, it depends on how you define the term ""conduct."" When I think of conduct, I think of criminal conduct.
I think the elements of the crime. If the elements of crime include a mens rea element of guilty knowledge, then the person convicted under the Florida law does not have that element -- is not found to have acted with guilty knowledge. I'm talking -- I'm talking about the actuality of the situation. People in other states who did exactly what this defendant did would get the ACCA enhancement. But the Florida statute does not involve the same conduct because the Florida -- the conduct in the Florida statute does not include a guilty knowledge.
So the -- the -- the defendants in Georgia and Florida are not similarly situated and not convicted of the same conduct. In these cases where your client was previously convicted of a Florida drug offense, did he go to trial or did he plead guilty? No, he pled guilty, Your Honor. All right.
So in all those cases, he pled guilty.
He could have raised an affirmative defense -- I didn't know what this was, I didn't know that it was cocaine -- but he didn't do that? No, he didn't.
But as far as -- as far -- as far as the categorical approach is concerned, it is not universal in the Florida law that convictions require a -- a finding of guilty knowledge. I -- I look forward to every new ACCA case because the -- the distance between the law and the reality gets bigger and bigger.
So here we have somebody who has, what, six prior convictions of either distribution or possession with intent to distribute? Yes, sir -- yes, Your Honor. He is in a strange situation, because he keeps selling a substance, which he thinks is legal and cheap, and, darn it, every single time it turns out actually to be something that is expensive and illegal.
He just keeps -- Yeah. How does this happen to him? I don't know how this happens to him, but, Your Honor, I am not trying to convince the Court that Mr. Shular himself acted without guilty knowledge.
I'm trying to convince the Court that, as a matter of law, he was not found to have acted with guilty knowledge. And the Court cannot presume, however commonsense it may be, to assume that he acted with guilty knowledge, because the question whether a defendant acts with guilty knowledge is a question of fact and that has to be determined in a Florida court. And it cannot be determined by a federal sentencing judge in a collateral sentencing proceeding. Mr. Summa, could you clarify two things for me? Part of what Justice Alito said, I must say, I didn't focus in on this. The affirmative defense in the Florida jury instructions, the prosecutor bears the burden of proving knowledge if the affirmative defense is raised.
Is that what your -- The -- the -- I assumed if it was an affirmative defense that the -- that the defendant had to prove the element. Your Honor, there are two points in the Florida jury instructions.
The first point casts on the defendant a burden of production of evidence. Then there's a jury instruction that the burden of proof falls on the -- the state. However, the point I was trying to make is that the Florida Supreme Court has never actually ruled where the burden of -- of ultimate proof would fall. All right.
Now, Justice Ginsburg said that there was a knowledge element. I understood there was a knowledge element just with respect to possession with intent to distribute, correct? That's correct.
The knowledge element with -- with respect to possession offenses, of which Mr. Shular has only one, is knowledge of the presence of the substance. But in the Florida jurisprudence, under the Chicone case, the knowledge of the presence is actually not -- it is a state of mind element but not regarded as a guilty state of mind, because the knowledge of the presence is something akin to what your mailman has when he delivers a package to your door.
He -- I'm getting now a little confused. As I understood it, your knowledge element goes, according to the Florida courts, goes to possession with intent to distribute. They've explicitly said you need knowledge that the substance was cocaine.
Correct? Not under the present law, Your Honor. Ah, okay.
So you don't need knowledge with manufacturing or sale? You don't need knowledge that substance is a controlled substance with any offense under the Florida law. But does the government have to prove that the substance that you actually manufactured or you actually sold was, in fact, cocaine? Yeah, they would have to prove that. All right.
So at least that would need.
What's missing is that the defendant knew that this was -- Exactly, Your Honor. Mr. Summa -- The -- I'm sorry, no, thank you. Can we go back to the -- the language of the statute and -- and I'm hoping you can explain to me where exactly you see this knowing requirement coming from. As I understand the solicitor general's position, he says, yes, this is a categorical approach, but it, you know, the -- the -- the language of the statute just says ""an offense involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent."" And the word ""knowing"" is not there. So, you know, the Florida statute, I think the solicitor general would say, is a state law that involves manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent. What's the problem there? The implication of the mens rea element comes from two sources.
One is the language, the prefatory language preceding the term ""involving"" and the second is from the language that follows ""involving."" When the Congress said we want prior convictions for felony offenses, I think that itself incorporates an expectation that felony offenses incorporate a mens rea element generally. And after the word ""involving,"" Congress used the language that is parallel to the federal statute and -- and the uniform controlled substance act -- I thought the federal statute specifically says ""knowingly manufacture."" And this state provision does not, but that's -- that's -- Well, not only the state provision does not, but this provision saying what the term serious drug offense means does not.
It takes out the word ""knowing."" That's exactly the situation where the presumption of mens rea applies.
And I understand your concern that the omission of the mens rea -- an express mens rea element in one part of the statute must apply something different. Now, if I may refer to that as the Rosillo rule, I would say that the Rosillo rule does not apply with the full force and effect that it does, generally, because it's a very general statute that could apply to criminal law, civil law, could apply to any word, could apply to any phrase in a statute. But the presumption of mens rea is a much more specific rule.
And where the omission is specifically of mens rea, that is a specific rule that applies in this context.
And if the specific controls the general in the law, then this rule, the presumption of men rea -- mens rea, supersedes the -- Counsel -- -- the Rosillo rule. Counsel, I think -- I think we would all agree with you that normally in a criminal provision mens rea would be something we would take very seriously. But here -- and I think Justice Kagan is getting at it -- we have -- we've got two strikes against you. One is that the federal statute that you say this language parallels expressly includes the word ""knowing."" It's not here. Strike one. And strike two is there's the word ""intent"" with respect to manufacturing or distributing in -- in the next clause.
So in the very next clause you do have a mens rea. Strike two. So what -- what do we do about that? Well, Your Honor, let me refer -- refer to strike two first.
If the government's position were adopted, that intent element that you refer to would be stricken entirely from the statute because the government talks about approval of the White case from the -- from the Eleventh Circuit. I -- I'm not sure I follow that because it seems to me that language would capture inchoate offenses, right, things that aren't completed, crimes that involve an intent to do these things, but not necessarily completion of them. I agree that the term ""involving"" may be broad enough to incorporate inchoate offenses that -- because that's a part of the federal drug trafficking crimes which qualify, correct, but the government says a -- a -- a trafficking statute that criminalized trafficking by possession of a specific quantity of drugs would qualify here because that necessarily entails an intent, but Congress -- my friend from the government is writing the intent requirement right out of the statute because it's a plain text requirement and it should be found by a jury, not by the judge, in a federal sentencing proceeding. Let me try it one more time. I think the solicitor general would say that he has to show either a state law involving manufacturing or distribution or a crime involving possession with the intent to do those other things, manufacturing, distribution, whether or not they actually complete the manufacturing or distribution. So those two clauses would do independent work, and the first one, notably, doesn't contain any mens rea while the second one does. But the -- the -- the -- my -- my friend's argument would also be so broad and indeterminate that it would sweep in convictions for purchases of -- of relatively minor amounts of drugs, personal use quantities. And my friend would be arguing that on a theory that a purchase of a minor quantity of drugs necessarily entails a distribution from the seller to the buyer. But didn't Congress get at that by the ten years of imprisonment minimum so that would weed out minor state offenses? No, Your Honor.
The specific example here is Florida because even the purchase of personal use quantity of drugs is punishable as a second degree felony by up to 15 years in prison. And I think it's probably true in a number of states as well. Then more broadly on your mens rea argument, which I think would have a great force if we were a Florida court interpreting the Florida statute, and should we interpret the Florida statute to require particular mens rea, but that's not what this statute is. It's a recidivist statute in trying to prevent the possession of firearms by people who have prior violent offenses or drug offenses. And Congress, because of the violence caused by people who have firearms and prior histories, wanted to really cast a broad net with what prior offenses would be captured and would trigger a duty on that person, don't possess firearms.
So they use the word ""involving."" So does Congress's -- what's your response to Congress's objective, which is reflected in the language to cast a broad net of what offenses might trigger this duty not to possess firearms? My response is that including offenses such as prescribed by Florida does -- is not consistent with the purpose of the statute.
I think you expressed the purpose of the statute quite well to capture the worst of the worst offenders, but this -- Florida's is so broad that it would capture the least culpable conduct.
It captures persons such as a truck driver who is hired to deliver a -- drive a shipment from point A to point B, and so the truck driver knows nothing about what is in the shipment.
All he knows is his job is to take it from point A -- That person -- To trigger -- -- to point B. That -- that person, I gather, under Florida law, that that person would say he has the right to say, Judge, I didn't know what was in the truck.
And then the government has to prove he did know.
Okay? So I guess the question for us is this -- it seems much simpler.
I don't know, I may be missing something.
But go look further down the statute. One of the things that comes under violent felony, it says ""is burglary."" So they have a conviction for something, and if it is burglary.
Now, every -- states have all kinds of statutes, you know.
So what you have to decide is does this particular conviction fall within the terms, burglary? It has to be burglary. So, obviously, you have to have a pretty good definition of what counts as burglary for federal purposes when it was the state that convicted him of state burglary. But it doesn't say that in this part. It doesn't say ""is manufacturing, distributing""; it says ""involves manufacturing or distributing,"" which is much vaguer. So if, in fact, Florida law is not quite you have to know the intent, it is that the burden falls on the defendant to say I didn't know what was in the truck and then the government has to prove it.
Is that different enough from ordinary drug possession as it's used across the country so that it doesn't involve drug manufacturing, selling? Now, I have to admit it sounds as if it does involve it, but you have a few examples there that really push me, and they're -- that's true -- but isn't that the issue? Your Honor, I have two responses. Yeah. One is that the affirmative defense doesn't offer what it seems to offer, because in the examples that -- But have I got the issue right? Yes, Your Honor. That's what I -- In the examples that I'm familiar with, the threat or the coercion of criminal -- criminal prosecution is so great that the defendant who is actually innocent may bargain away his affirmative defense for a lesser sentence and actually plead guilty. The second comment I have is that the distinction between ""is"" and ""involving"" is highly overrated because the term ""is"" was not the driver of the generic offense analysis and so it cannot be viewed as a prerequisite for the generic offense analysis.
The driver was the term ""burglary."" The court found that burglary was ambiguous, not knowing whether it referred to the common law definition or the definition of burglary as it appeared throughout the states generally. And Congress settled on the generic definition in order to further the interest in uniform -- uniformity in sentencing for the same conduct throughout the states.
That same interest in fake -- the uniformity of sentencing for the same conduct throughout the states weighs in favor of construing -- excuse me -- construing the state provisions similar to the federal provisions. And in your truck example, again, I think if you're in Florida court, that's a great argument, construe this narrowly, don't construe it broadly, this is unfair, this is a due process kind of problem, a Morissette kind of problem.
But once you have the conviction and you have two other convictions, you have three convictions, then you know, if you read federal law, I shouldn't possess firearms or I'm going to be subject to a severe mandatory minimum. Aren't you on -- I guess the point is aren't you on fair notice when you have those convictions, even if you think those convictions are unfair, that you shouldn't possess firearms? But I think we agree here that the point that we're trying to decide here is whether Congress intended this type of crime to qualify.
And there's very little reason to suggest Congress did so, one, because it's such an aberrational law; and, two, because the symmetry between the federal and state provisions provides very little deference to the states. In other words, there are three points: One, it starts out by the terms ""manufacturing, distribution,"" et cetera, which seems to parallel the federal statute.
Two, it says the definition of controlled substance has to be construed in conformity with federal law, not state law.
And, three, it says that the length of the sentences must satisfy Congress's demand to be more than ten years -- punishable by more than ten years. So the overall symmetry between the federal and the state offenses affords very little, almost none, I would say, discretion to idiosyncratic rules of state law. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Bond. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) prescribes a categorical approach to determine whether a state drug offense qualifies as an ACCA predicate.
But unlike another nearby ACCA provision, clause (B)(ii), which uses ""is,"" clause (A)(ii) does not call for the generic analogue inquiry that Petitioner advocates. That follows from the statutory text. Specifically, the use of the word ""involving"" followed by a series of everyday action words, not legal terms of art that denote complete crimes.
That is fully consistent with this Court's precedent. Petitioner's contrary approach would require courts to construct a complete generic version of each offense based on a 50-state survey of laws from three decades ago and then compare that generic analogue to a particular state's offense at a particular moment in time to see if they match in every respect. That approach has proven challenging enough for the enumerated offenses in (B)(ii) like burglary, which were well established and relatively consistent in 1986.
It would be even more challenging for state drug trafficking crimes, which in 1986 were comparatively new and varied in multiple material ways.
And it would increase the risk of arbitrary sentencing disparities arising from variation in ancillary aspects of state law, like which bore the burden of persuasion on the knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance. In clause (A)(ii), Congress chose a much simpler approach that asked just two questions.
Did the state offense involve one of these activities and, for possession, a specified intent? And did it carry a maximum sentence of at least ten years? And that mirrors the federal provision in (A)(i). Under that straight-forward approach, Petitioner's convictions clearly qualify.
And that approach cuts through the variation and uncertainty in state law, like the questions that have arisen this morning about Florida law, and instead uses a broad range of conduct, plus this ten-year maximum penalty threshold to filter out and screen out low-level state offenses. And it avoided freezing in place the particular variance of state crimes that happened to predominate in 1986. We're told that, under Florida law, you could have a pretty low level offense, we just heard that, and -- and have a 15-year maximum. So it's true that there are substantial sentences, although as the colloquy pointed out and we explained in our brief, under Florida law knowledge of illicit -- of the illicit nature or lack of such knowledge is an affirmative defense. So for an element that's not specified in the statute -- in the federal statute at all, it seems particularly unlikely that Congress meant the burden of -- or the allocation of the burden of proof on that element to drive the -- the ACCA analysis. What is the -- In federal prosecutions, how does it work? How is this element -- how does the prosecutor prove the -- the defendant knew that the substance was illegal? So, under the federal Controlled Substances Act, which expressly requires a knowing mens rea, as this Court explained in McFadden, that extends to the -- the substance itself, the defendant must either know what the substance is or know that it's a controlled substance. But as McFadden pointed out, that knowledge can be shown by the fact of a prior arrest for possessing or selling that substance. It's very unlikely that in a recidivist statute like this, where Congress is only imposing this enhancement for those who have multiple past convictions, the Congress was worried about the unlikely scenario where a person repeatedly sells an illicit substance believing it to be innocent or believing it not to be a controlled substance. We think that's just not a plausible understanding of what Congress was getting at here.
So we think that for all the reasons we have explained in our brief, you should not adopt the generic analog inquiry, and the alternative fallback argument Petitioner is offering today, that focuses on reading a mens rea, we think fails for several independent reasons. Why isn't the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question that under the federal scheme the -- the knowledge of the illegal nature of the substance is almost always inferred from the defendant's conduct? It's not based on -- it's not generally based on direct evidence; isn't that right? Yes, that's right.
And under Florida law it works similarly, that if you possess one of these controlled substances, Florida law, and this is Section 893.101(c), allows a permissive presumption that you knew what it was you were selling, and that can be rebutted by the defendant. So in the scenario where a defendant says I didn't realize that this was cocaine, I thought it was powdered sugar or some non-controlled substance, the defendant can bring that in. Now, we're not aware of a large number of cases that fall in this delta.
It does not seem like it's a particularly significant thing in Florida prosecutions.
But in all events, it seems quite unlikely that Congress intended the application of this recidivist enhancement to turn on those kinds of vagaries of state law. Now, with respect to the mens rea requirement -- Under the federal scheme, are there a lot of cases in which a defendant is acquitted based on lack of knowledge of the illegal nature of the substance involved, without actually testifying I didn't know that it was an illegal substance? I'm -- I'm not aware of statistics on that.
It wouldn't at all surprise me if that's -- that's correct, but I -- I -- I don't have statistics on the frequency with which that occurs. And turning to whether to read in a mens rea requirement into (a)(2), I think there are three fundamental problems with Petitioner's argument here. First, the ordinary meaning of the words, which this Court, in ACCA cases as elsewhere, has looked to does not include an intent requirement; certainly not intent with or knowledge with respect to the illicit nature of the substances. The Petitioner urges you to look to the ordinary meaning of ""manufacture"" and ""distribute"" in his reply brief.
And the ordinary meaning of those words does not pick up knowledge that the thing you're making or selling is illegal. Now, I think his argument really rests on this idea that these are somehow terms of art or were in 1986.
And that argument doesn't hold water either.
The federal statute as has been discussed expressly imposed that knowing or intentional requirement in addition to using these words.
That's not only in the Controlled Substances Act but in the other statutes cross-referenced in clause (a)(2), the Import/Export Act and the maritime statute. All of them expressly impose this additional mens rea requirement. At the state level there was variation.
Roughly two-thirds of the states followed what was then the Uniform Act approach of not expressly requiring mens rea, while the other third followed federal law and did expressly include it. Now, Congress was looking out at the landscape of state law in 1986.
I think it would be hard to infer that Congress by using this series of words thought it was picking up a mens rea that some states and federal law imposed expressly.
Other states in a number of circumstances had read in, based on background principles of state law, but where the words themselves don't carry that particular meaning. And, in addition, states did not all use the same terms.
Although a number, roughly three-fifths, used the terms that follow the federal act, a number used a variety of different verbs to pick up conduct in addition to these or in replacement of these, like giveaway, transport, peddle, offer, traffic, negotiate and barter.
And the list goes on. The point is states were not using these as terms of art when they were using different terms. Mr. Bond, do you think Congress intended to criminalize a mailman's delivery or Postal Service delivery? I -- I -- I doubt it.
But what you're saying is that -- and -- and there is a disconnect, like in Leocal, where we talked about using physical force.
And we said it can't mean negligent force.
It has to be an intentional force. Similarly, it seems nonsensical to think that manufacturing -- what are the words of the California statute -- manufacturing or delivering or possessing with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, can't have some knowledge requirement because it ends with ""a controlled substance."" So -- So -- How -- how can you manufacture a controlled substance if you don't know it's a controlled substance? It seems like a non sequitur. So a few different points on that.
First, Florida law does require that you know the substance is present.
So it wouldn't be implicated here.
If you're a delivery person who's carrying an opaque sealed box and you don't know that there's cocaine inside, I don't think you could be prosecuted under Florida law because you must know of the presence of the thing, regardless of whether you know its character, so that's not implicated under Florida's law.
But take -- You think so? I don't know why, because under yours it says, ""any person who sells, manufactures, or delivers or possesses with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver."" So whether the box is opaque or not, under the theory as your briefs gave it to me, if it's a controlled substance in the box, you intend to possess it. So I think there's an important twist in federal -- or in Florida law here that explains where how that state would address this circumstance. Until 2002, the state courts had interpreted the statute to require knowledge of the illicit nature.
The legislature overturned that and said knowledge of the illicit nature is not an element.
It is instead an affirmative defense. But that did not wipe out the preexisting requirement that you must know of the presence of the substance.
And the state's Supreme Court confirmed that in an opinion in 2014 called In Re Standard Jury Instructions in Criminal Cases, this is 153 Southern 3d 192, where they reject a change that would have suggested uncertainty about who needs to prove presence of the substance or knowledge of the presence of the substance because it points back to the case we cite, Atkins, saying, look, Florida law is already clear on this. If we -- So all of that is about Florida -- If we -- if we had a federal statute, not a recidivist statute, but a straight up federal statute that said it's unlawful to manufacture, distribute or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute a controlled substance, it is 100 percent, or close to it, that we would require mens rea and knowledge of the substance. Don't you agree with that? So we agree that ordinarily you would read in a -- you would presume a mens rea requirement.
Exactly how that would apply across the different elements -- So you -- so if you agree, if this were a straight up federal statute, that mens rea would be read in, why not read it in to a recidivist statute? For some of the reasons that came up in the colloquy earlier, that in a recidivist statute there is no concern about fair notice of what you were already convicted of. And in addition, Congress isn't using the mens rea for a particular offense as the substantive threshold for how serious something is.
Congress took a different approach that side-stepped all the variation and uncertainty in state law by covering a broad range of drug trafficking conduct, but only if the crime carries at least a ten-year maximum sentence. That's ten times the threshold in the violent felonies provision in -- in subparagraph (b). It's also the same threshold used in the federal provision, (a)(1), that refers to any crime under the Controlled Substances Act, the Controlled Substances Import/Export Act, and a particular maritime statute.
So Congress is covering a broad range of conduct but using the punishment as a proxy for the seriousness of the offense. I think that fits together with the idea that Congress isn't asking courts to read in a mens rea into state statutes that might have predated ACCA and determine whether they correspond in a particular respect to an element Congress didn't mention. Instead Congress cast this wide net with respect to conduct but used the penalty as the filter to screen out lower level offenses. But as Justice Ginsburg said, and counsel said, the penalty might not be that much of a filter, given the severe penalties attached to certain seemingly low-level offenses. And you -- can you respond to that again? Sure.
It -- it's entirely possible that states would impose serious sentences for those kinds of things.
We're not aware of a large number of them.
They -- it -- it did exist in 1986 that not every state -- So then that -- -- required mens rea. Sorry to interrupt.
If that's true that's not much of a filter then? I think it is a filter and would have -- would have been viewed by Congress as a meaningful filter in the vast majority of cases.
We're not aware of any other state that imposes this kind of penalty for this -- for this category of offense where it's an affirmative defense that you don't have knowledge, rather than an -- an affirmative element. And I think the point is Congress, looking across the landscape of law, of state laws in 1986, wouldn't have viewed this in a recidivist statute as being a serious problem. I think the concern that Congress had in 1986 was, look, there are a variety of state laws that involve drug trafficking.
There's -- it's clear from the text of the legislative history that Congress was trying to include those laws. But rather than get caught up on exactly how each state defined it and exactly how they parsed the mens rea requirement, how they grouped particular offenses, which also differed, and whether they used particular enhancements to get to the ten-year threshold, Congress just took a simpler approach, saying if it involves drug trafficking conduct and it involves a -- or it carries a maximum sentence of at least ten years, then we are concerned that your subsequent possession of a firearm unlawfully presents a sufficient risk that we need to impose a greater sentencing. Mr. Bond -- So I think that's what was driving it. Mr. Bond, I have two questions.
Feel free to tackle them in any particular order you wish. First, what is your understanding of how the affirmative defense works under Florida law? There was some confusion about that in our earlier discussion as to who bears the burden at the end of the day.
I'd be -- I'd be curious to know the government's position on that, Number 1. And, Number 2, related to what Justice Sotomayor was asking you, forget about Florida law for a moment.
The word ""involves"" I think we would both agree is a pretty broad word. Right? Everything in the world pretty much involves everything else, at some level of connection. And what do we do about the fact that this statute would, at least possibly, capture a state law that had a draconian penalty for delivering a drug without knowing what it is? I mean ""involves"" would seem to capture that. Your colleague on the other side says there's a vagueness concern here that you're ultimately inviting a constitutional challenge on.
So those two questions. So if I can take them in order.
Our understanding of Florida law is that when the affirmative defense is invoked, the burden remains on the defendant at that point to demonstrate that he did not have knowledge of the illicit nature. And a defendant who possesses the substance, when that happens under 893.101(c), a permissive presumption is available that can be drawn by the jury -- can be inferred by the jury that the person actually knew of what it was they were then manufacturing and distributing, if they had possession of it.
So that's our understanding of Florida law. I don't think anything turns on that here, but that's -- that's how we understand it. Now -- How do you draw -- how do you draw the line he's referring to? I mean, suppose the state legalizes marijuana but it has a criminal provision which says anyone who sells marijuana at a price that is higher than X, you see, is committing a -- or lower than Y, is committing a serious offense, et cetera.
Okay? Now, is it picking up like economic control statutes if their -- if their -- you know, if they -- criminalized like the antitrust laws or something? Yeah, so I -- I don't think that -- It involves it, I mean. I think you have to look to the elements of the offense as -- as under categorical approach generally.
So unless the statute that you're describing were divisible into a drug sale -- Yeah, it is. Right -- What do you want it to say? I'll -- Sure. -- I'll agree to everything. If -- if the statute is divisible and has one element, one alternative element, that involves the sale of drugs -- Yeah. -- and one that does not -- It says marijuana. -- involve the sale of drugs -- sure.
Then it's -- It's a controlled substance.
It says it's legal in this state. I'd just be repeating myself.
And -- and all that they're forbidding, though, is something to do with price. Yes, and a number of states do impose an aggravating circumstance based on -- Ten years, and that's -- if you did that, then this statute kicks in, even though what he really did was make a price agreement, or he didn't get the right license, et cetera. Yes, I think that's -- that's correct, that that would -- that would fall under the federal definition. Well, then there's another way of doing it, he says, you don't have to go that broad at all.
He says let's look at the -- let's look at the real elements of the very comparable crime, which is the crime of possessing a controlled substance with intent to distribute it, a well-known crime, and he says look at those elements. And, by the way, those elements, everywhere but Florida, require the prosecution to come in -- you've heard the argument -- and -- and to show that he knew that this powder was heroin. So a few -- a few points. A state crime for possession with intent to distribute would be picked up under the plain language of the statute, and the fact states might or might not require additional elements doesn't change the meaning of the words or what Congress was trying to capture. No, no.
But that's general.
What I'm trying to do is to go back to the question I think Justice Gorsuch was asking and say once we get in a definition of the word ""involved,"" which is broader than the elements of the state traditional crime which every state has but one, we've opened the door to all kinds of things such as economic crimes, which do involve but don't seem to be what Congress is interested in. So if I can take on ""involves"" directly.
So, first, I don't think it's that complicated of an inquiry, just as this Court explained in Kawashima, where it said the involvement clause was clear.
We look to the elements.
If they necessarily entail this conduct, game over.
It's a straightforward inquiry, at least in the mine-run of cases. Now, we understand there to be daylight between the involves clause and -- and elements clause or something along those lines because it would pick up solicitation or financing offenses. For example, California's law, Section 11353, that makes it a crime if you hire a minor to engage in selling -- selling a particular drug.
Whether or not the state has to prove that the drugs were sold by the minor, you have engaged in conduct that involves distribution.
Indeed, that's the whole point of the conduct. But at the end of the day, whatever you think about the meaning of the word ""involves,"" it's a problem for Petitioner as much as it is for us.
He agrees, at reply brief page 7, with our interpretation of it.
And whatever he thinks about the word, you still have to address its meaning on either theory. The word -- Petitioner's principal submission is about the meaning of ""manufacturing, distributing, and possession -- and possessing."" Those words all follow ""involves."" So on both sides' theories, you still have to figure out what ""involves"" means. I -- I understand there's tricky sides -- tricky questions for the Petitioner.
I think we're trying to address one that's tricky for you. And -- and -- and that is if ""involves"" is as capacious as you suggest, state law, the draconian penalties for anybody who unwittingly provides substances that are used in the manufacture of drugs or the delivery of illicit drugs with no mens rea, just because we hate drug crimes and recidivists and, you know, those sorts of policy considerations, how far out does ""involved"" go? You know, somebody who finances people who deliver drugs unwittingly, thought they were investing in a -- a legitimate business, but it turns out that they're mules for -- for -- for a drug manufacturer? How -- I mean, you -- this thing could trace out quite dramatically at either end of -- of the spectrum before and after the actual crime.
Quite far.
That's -- that's my concern. So I think the concern would be addressed because it would only pick up state offenses whose elements as a categorical matter involve -- Sure.
No, no.
The state offense is going to say anybody who finances anybody else who delivers a drug, an illicit drug.
All right? So there's -- there's manufacture and distribution right there in the statute, but the -- the defendant's involvement is maybe three or four steps removed in either direction, antecedent or after the fact.
What do we do about that? So I think the -- the answer under -- under the existing law is that if the state has imposed a ten-year or more sentence and the defendant has three or more convictions under that statute, yes, it can be an ACCA predicate.
Congress used the substantive threshold of the penalty rather than trying to target specific conduct and to parse out exactly what mens rea was necessary. Well, I -- well, any person -- who knows what California will pass as a law.
But they have marijuana shops.
Anyone who invests in a marijuana shop, anyone, that could be a one share, and the marijuana shop turns out to sell some cocaine on the side -- ten years.
Now, they could, and that's -- that's a kind of far-out example. And what we're trying to do is, since you've challenged everyone here to use their imaginations, the -- the -- is to -- is to suggest, well, he's saying the safer thing -- So I think -- -- is to not give a special meaning to ""involve,"" but just look at what has been the traditional meaning of ""distribution with intent to distribute,"" of ""manufacture with intent to distribute,"" of ""selling,"" et cetera, et cetera.
In that tradition, then he has to face the hurdle has he really departed enough from the traditional meaning when you have this burden shift. So a couple of points. Ours is on the first part. Yeah, and just to put a friendly amendment to that, I don't mean to prolong it, but ""involve"" has to end somewhere along the chain, right? At some point, you're going so say it no longer ""involves,"" I would think, a drug crime. Where is that? Is it enough for the state -- if the state just simply says some attachment to a drug, you know, five -- five layers removed, and a drug crime was involved, is that enough? Or does the government have some position on whether that might not be enough at some point in the causal chain? It might not be enough at some point in the causal chain if you can't say with confidence that it -- that the elements necessarily entail this particular result.
That will depend on the state -- And why -- I'm sorry, go ahead. It depends on the particular crime at issue.
And so there are, for example, state crimes where -- a -- a trafficking statute where the highest level of the statute -- of the trafficking regime says that if you possess a certain large quantity of drugs, we're going to infer -- we're going to conclusively presume an intent to distribute based on the quantity there.
That involves possession with intent to distribute because state law presumes that you have that particular intent. So I think there are plenty of things that fall within ""involves"" that don't -- that don't push that outer limit. Now, I -- I take the point about the concern about -- Sorry.
Stop right there.
Right there.
What's the amount? Meaning let's assume that a state says you possess any amount of -- of cocaine, we presume you intend to distribute.
Is that -- does that involve a crime? What's the generic meaning? So the -- the state offenses that we're aware of have used a 28-gram threshold.
And the Eleventh Circuit held that possession of that amount, which is a pretty common threshold, is sufficient to trigger -- But the Fourth didn't.
Because the Fourth basically said what -- ""involves"" has to involve possession with intent to distribute. That's right.
And there -- And you can't read a presumption into an intent with -- with that. So -- but you are.
How about if they lower it to 4 grams? I think 4 grams is well within what most people possess with use, personal use. Well, I think at that point it would be much more difficult to say that a state law is -- is presuming intent based on that statute. So why don't we read it literally? It has to involve the -- possession with intent to distribute, not a presumption of intent to distribute. Sure.
And at the end of the day nothing in this case turns on exactly what you think the delta is between has as an element and involves. If you conclude that those are ultimately synonyms, I don't think much would ultimately change.
We do think that the Congress intended there to be some delta to pick up statutes that reach slightly beyond an element of possession or -- sorry, an element of manufacturing and distributing, to other crimes like solicitation and financing.
But if at the end of the day -- Yeah, but I'm really worried about the fact that you've -- on that delta, you said the Eleventh Circuit is right, right only because a state has used the label. I don't think it's because the state has used the label.
The Eleventh Circuit pointed out that in the context of that particular scheme, it was quite implausible that the -- the -- the state legislature, I think it was Alabama, intended that the highest level of its scheme not to become an ACCA predicate and not to involve conduct that would give rise to this kind of inference, even though lower level offenses did.
It's a context-specific thing. And we're not suggesting that this case turns on exactly where you draw the line, and where the -- where the Eleventh Circuit drew it or where the Fourth Circuit drew it with respect to that 28 gram threshold. What does this have to do with the question in this case? It totally -- it's a totally different question. The quantity of drugs from which you can infer that there was an intent to distribute, what -- what does that have to do with anything in this case? So we -- we agree that the question here is much more straightforward and doesn't turn on exactly what you conclude involves means, whether you think that a particular quantity is -- can -- can be used as the basis to infer that -- that possession with intent to distribute will necessarily be entailed by the conduct or not. The question here is simply -- You can intend -- you can be convicted -- am I wrong -- of possession with intent to distribute, even a very small amount of drugs, if there's proof that you intended to distribute it. Certainly.
That's right. And so that's a separate question of when you can -- when you can infer from the quantity of drugs that there was an intent to distribute. You could have a state, if you want to hypothesize, draconian state law that says if you intend to distribute one gram, that is -- that is a felony punishable by 50 years in jail. That would raise potentially other questions, but has nothing to do with the issue here. That's exactly right, Your Honor.
I don't think anything turns on exactly how far you construe that provision to extend. And if -- if at the end of the day -- And so to be clear, just to be very clear, if you win here, to Justice Alito's question, the question where to draw the line on state possession statutes would remain open for litigation in future cases.
Correct? So you will still have the question of what particular crimes necessarily entail distribution, manufacture, or possession with intent to distribute, but that litigation and that kind of uncertainty is dwarfed by the litigation that Petitioner's theory is presenting, which would require you not just to figure out what that specific thing means but the elements of the complete offense or of each of these three offenses in 1986. You also -- And also -- I'm sorry. I was just going to say you emphasize in your brief the difficulty of -- I -- I -- I'll just quote -- ""attempting to synthesize generic versions of these offenses from the motley raw material of state and federal laws."" Your office will keep that in mind the next time you urge us to adopt a generic approach? (Laughter.) I think there's a -- there's a material difference between state drug trafficking laws in 1986, and I think Petitioner acknowledges, and the offenses that Congress recognized were sufficiently well defined in 1986 that it could refer to them by name and understand that -- and courts would understand what Congress was referring to, particularly the offenses that previously had already been defined in the ACCA before the 1986 amendments, like burglary and robbery, which is no longer -- I -- I -- -- defined. I wonder whether you'll also keep in mind this -- this question about involves, you know, the use and carry provision of 924 has kept courts awfully busy, right, what is a ""use""? Are we going to, you know, what is our assurance we're not going to have similar amounts of concern and litigation about what's an ""involving""? So, again, both sides have the same problem with respect to the word ""involving."" And the ordinary meaning of it, as the Court explained in Kawashima, is relatively straightforward. And, again, you look to the ordinary meaning of these words.
The same as you did in Waseem, look at use of force, that connotes a certain amount of volitional conduct.
It doesn't necessarily mean knowing -- The use of a gun involves -- the government has told us involves bartering, it involves -- it's in the room, it's somewhere in the house, it's in the neighborhood.
That's a use of a gun. Why -- why aren't we going to be going down that road here? I don't think that the language compels you to go down the road.
It simply tells you to look to the elements of the offense and determine whether they necessarily entail this conduct. And in this case there's no reason to go beyond determining -- Mr. Bond, Florida is the only state that takes out mens rea; 49 other states don't.
And I don't actually know why it's -- why there would have been a fear of what other states were doing since most of them were adopting the uniform definition of manufacturing, sale, and production -- and distribution. So -- Yes, there might be production uses but I -- I'm not quite sure what the worry on your part is. Well, so -- I think -- if I can challenge the premise about what was clear in 1968, as Petitioner acknowledges, the North Dakota Supreme Court had directly rejected this mens rea requirement.
I don't think it was clear in -- in a number of the other two-thirds of the states whose statutes did not expressly require mens rea. Petitioner cites cases that come long after 1986 or address different enhanced -- But right now, 49 other states include it. We're not aware of any other state besides Florida that has emphatically rejected this -- this knowledge requirement as Florida has done. Either as expressed or implied, correct? We're not aware of a -- of a state that falls in that category.
I'm not sure it is as clear in every state to the extent the Petitioner is describing.
But -- The point of the statute is to tell people who have these prior convictions not to possess firearms? Exactly.
The point of this enhancement provision is those that have three or more -- And there are a lot of people in Florida or who have prior Florida offenses who Congress didn't want to possess firearms. That's exactly right.
And so the idea that we would read into mens rea for these already completed crimes is just detached from Congress's purpose here, which is to impose a sufficiently serious sanction on those who in Congress's judgment pose an increased risk when they possess firearms because of their history of repeatedly engaging in drug trafficking crimes or violent felonies that carry significant penalties, and a -- for the case of drug trafficking crimes, a ten-year maximum sentence or more. If there are no further questions. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Summa, five minutes. The purpose of the statute is not exactly to tell people who have prior convictions not to possess firearms.
The purpose of the statute is to identify those people, those felons who possess firearms but who would also deliberately use those firearms to harm other people. As -- as the Court stated in Begay, identify the people who are likely to point their weapon and fire their weapon. When you have a statute that criminalizes the truck driver who doesn't even know what substance is, that person is less culpable, that person does not have the motive or the intent to defend this unknown substance by violent action or by use of a gun. To the extent that the Court is concerned about the scope and the effect of the term ""involving,"" I think this Court should be guided by the interpretation of the RICO statute in the Scheidler case.
There the statute proscribed acts or threats involving, followed by a list of crimes such as murder, kidnapping, arson and extortion, and in that context the Court said the term extortion must be regarded in its generic sense. And, to the extent that there's still any lingering ambiguity about the scope of the term ""involving,"" the legislative history that we cited in our initial briefs shows the intent of Congress. When Congress drafted this state offense provision, the history shows that Congress intended to add ""offenses,"" not ""conduct,"" not ""activities,"" but add ""offenses"" described generally, which translates to the generic sense. And I would also point to this Court's Moncrieffe decision, when the clerk was confronted with elicit trafficking in a controlled substance, the Court said illicit -- illicit trafficking in a controlled substance is a generic crime. Compare that to what we have here, phrases such as ""manufacture of a -- of a controlled substance"" and ""distribution of a controlled substance,"" these phrases even more specifically describe generic crimes. Their -- Congress uses models to identify predicate crimes.
What we're asking the Court in this case to do is no more and no less than the Court did in the Esquivel-Quintana case, when the predicate crime was described as sexual abuse of the minor and that crime may not be clearly defined, the model says look to a related federal statute. Now, if the Court still thinks there's ambiguity about what ""manufacturing of a controlled substance"" means or ""distribution of a controlled substance"" means, begin by looking to the related statute for how it defines the crimes.
The related statute here is, of course, the federal drug trafficking provision, which describes the crimes to include a mens rea element, and the Court said in Esquivel-Quintana, then look to the survey of state law to see how the states define the crimes and all those factors contribute to the -- to the finding of the definition of what constitutes the generic federal crime. If Congress had before it when it drafted this provision of ACCA these two models, the federal model where the prosecution has to prove that guilty knowledge of the nature of the substance, and the Florida model, which differs only in that the defendant has to raise this as a -- an affirmative defense, has to say I didn't know that it was an illegal substance, Congress would think there's enough difference between those two models to say that only the former is included and not the latter? I think Congress -- yes, Congress would have decided the law is so overwhelmingly in favor of a mens rea element, that's what we generally would contemplate. Is there any practical difference between those two? I -- I mean, I don't see it.
I don't think very many people are going to get -- get acquitted under the federal law unless they're willing to stand up and say I didn't know this was cocaine, in which case the two things are exactly the same. Well, Your Honor, I respectfully say that you are giving short shrift to the general requirement -- my time's up, may I -- You may.
Go ahead. You are giving general short shrift to the significance of jury findings. If a jury does not find, as it does in the Florida law, that the defendant has engaged in blameworthy conduct, the court, in a federal court, in a sentencing proceeding should assume that the defendant did not have that guilty knowledge because the -- the -- the federal sentencing court cannot make that finding for the first time in a collateral sentencing proceeding.
And I thank you very much. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"On behalf of the Respondents 34 We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-1712, Thole versus United States Bank. Mr. Stris. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My clients are beneficiaries of a pension trust.
We allege that the trustees, through disloyalty and imprudence, caused the trust to lose $750 million.
The suit presents a justiciable case or controversy for three reasons: First, my clients have an equitable interest in all assets of their pension trust. That is a property interest.
And when $750 million of that property was lost, my clients suffered a concrete injury. Respondents are between a rock and a hard place.
They can't argue that participants have an equitable interest in only some of the trust corpus, because the trust is unsegregated and undivided.
So they're forced to take the incredible position, to quote their brief, that defined-benefit plan participants have no interest in plan assets. If Respondents were right, no one would have an equitable interest in any of the trust's assets.
But a trust can't exist unless someone holds equitable title to its assets, and that someone here can only be the participants. Second, and independently, my clients have a right to loyal stewardship of their retirement savings.
When Respondents engaged in self-dealing, my clients suffered a concrete injury.
Under the centuries-old ""no further inquiry"" rule, beneficiaries could sue even when there was no conceivable possibility of a financial loss.
The breach itself gives rise to a case or controversy. In any event, and third, my clients have representational standing to vindicate injury to their plan.
Since before the founding, when a trustee was unwilling to sue, equity courts allowed beneficiaries to do so on behalf of the trust. And so I'd like to begin with our property injury.
A defined-benefit plan under ERISA is a private exchange of services. Workers forgo wages in exchange for a promise of a future payment secured by trust property. This is critical because there is an unsegregated, undivided pool of assets, the trust, that pays the pension of all the beneficiaries.
So plan participants, like my clients, have an equitable interest in those assets. Does your argument depend upon a forward-looking theory of injury? In other words, it's -- if -- it's one thing to have a -- a conflict of interest or all the other things you allege that lead to a situation that causes you no direct financial harm, but is your theory that, well, because they did that in this situation, and even if that didn't hurt us, somebody like that is likely to do it again and that might hurt us? Or is it purely the fact of -- retrospective, this person did something that under common trust law would be regarded as a bad thing, and under the no inquiry rule, that's enough, so you shouldn't worry about the fact that it didn't harm us at all? So the answer to that question is we have multiple concrete injuries here.
And the things that we're seeking flow from the particular injuries, right? So what I'm talking about right now is our property injury.
If we're right that we have an equitable interest in the assets, that theory depends on a diminution in the value of the trust assets.
So I don't know -- I wouldn't call that prospective; I would say the trust lost $750 million, and so -- But what did your clients lose? I mean, your friend on the other side says they get nothing.
They're in the same position if you win or if you lose. Well, so I mean I -- I couldn't disagree with that more.
There's always risk.
Pension plans fail.
Businesses fail.
In 2008, AIG had $100 billion until they didn't.
And so -- Well, those are other situations.
They say in this case -- well, just look at it abstractly.
You know, say you need $600 million in your fund so everybody will feel comfortable your clients are going to get everyone's benefits, and, you know, there are $8 million in the fund and there's some fraud that reduces it to -- 800 million to -- to 700 million.
Do you think you could sue on that -- that misconduct by the trustee? Well, if -- if the assets of the trust are -- are lost and there's been a breach, yes.
I don't think it's abstract at all.
If I loan -- if I loan Bill Gates money and take -- and I take a security interest, and he destroys the secured property, he encumbers it, he burns it down, I can still sue him even if he makes every progress payment and happens to have $100 million in assets because we recognize that having a security interest in something is concrete. Our core position -- But I understood -- I meant my hypothetical to suppose that the -- your property is -- is secure, your -- your -- your client's property, the beneficiaries' property is completely secure. In the Gates hypothetical, I thought you were suggesting -- you seem to be suggesting the security that -- that protected the -- the interest of your -- your loan was -- was destroyed. Oh, but -- But in my hypothetical -- it may not be your case -- but -- but in the abstract, what's alleged to have been wrongfully done doesn't affect the financial security of your defined-benefit plan. You can still sue -- So -- -- because the person's a bad guy? No.
You can still sue, but not because the person is a bad guy, but because your property interest has been impaired.
I want to be very clear about this. To have an equitable interest -- this has been the case since the 15th century.
To have an equitable interest in trust assets, a beneficiary has never had to show that she's likely to receive the trust assets.
As long as she has the possibility of benefiting from the assets, she has a present property right to prevent others from damaging them.
That's the lesson from the contingent and discretionary -- But would they -- But what's the -- -- say -- -- cases. But what's the lesson from Article III? There has to be a tangible injury to the plaintiff.
And under my hypothetical, if 600 million's enough to secure them against anything, and the trust corpus goes from 800 million to 700 million, how are they injured in the terms of Article III? In the same way that if I own property and you come and you put your toe on it, even though I never saw you, you didn't step on my tulips, you didn't upset me in any way, you impaired my property right. What if -- what if, counsel -- I mean, just to put the Chief's point in a -- in a finer light even than he has, which I think he has done an admirable job of, let's say this were a defined benefits plan rather than a defined contribution plan.
And let's say that -- sorry, this were a defined contribution plan rather than a defined benefits plan.
And -- and the menu of options is varied.
Most of them are clean.
But there is one option that's dirty.
Okay? But your client didn't invest in that. Sure. Would you -- could you still sue? I don't think -- I don't think -- I mean, even in the law of trusts way back to the 15th century, there was a remoteness limitation -- Well -- -- on how far someone could sue, wasn't there? Well, so, Justice Gorsuch, I think there wouldn't be standing but it would have nothing to do with -- with remoteness.
And here's why: In a defined contribution plan, the assets are -- are unsegregated, just as in a defined benefit plan.
That's true.
But they're not undivided. So the proper analogue there would be -- and this happened a lot -- you had a trust, it held the deed to Whiteacre.
It held the deed to Blackacre.
We don't suggest that the person who had the beneficial interest in Blackacre could sue for a restoration of losses to Whiteacre.
That's the case in a defined contribution plan. Okay.
So there are Article III limits, then, on how far the standing -- whatever is provided for by the statute here. Well, there are many limits, just to be clear about the modesty of our position.
First of all, from a historical standpoint, this is probably -- this -- what we're describing here in terms of the property interests impairment has more of -- at least as much of a historical pedigree as qui tam suits in Vermont Agency.
And this Court has said time and time again that if suits existed at the time of the founding, it fit the definition of case or controversy from a constitutional perspective. If we do that -- I don't remember the 15th century, surprisingly, but, nonetheless -- (Laughter.) We did look up some things.
And my -- at least a quick research suggests that -- that there are different duties, fiduciary duties.
One is the duty of loyalty.
Another is the duty of prudence. And in respect to loyalty, yes, what you say, I think, shows pretty accurate, people with an interest in trust, like beneficiary can sue the trustee for breach of the loyalty where he may be invested in a great investment for them, but he shouldn't have, because it helped him too. But there was a duty of prudence, which seems what you're really interested in. And there you couldn't.
That is to say, they said that a -- that a life beneficiary could sue for loss of income but if there is no risk of loss of income, he can't sue. A remainderman could sue to injuries to the principal of the trust, but that's all he has an interest in.
And as long as that's safe, he can't sue. Now if that's the right analogy, I would draw from that, yeah, you can sue for duties of breach of loyalty, but not for duties of a breach of prudence. So a few responses, Justice Breyer. So loyalty is our second injury.
I haven't gotten to that yet.
The property injury is prudence.
That is what I'm talking about. And there the remainderman could not sue, it says. We're -- absolutely. We're not a remainderman. Oh, you aren't? What is your interest in the money -- in the trust that is any greater since it's fully funded and everything and has many, many sources, that was greater than the remainderman's interest in the income that's being paid out of a body -- a corpus, which you will eventually get, which isn't hurt? The answer is, we have an interest in a promise of future payments secured by the entirety of the trust corpus. And let me tell you about history.
So the rule for a present beneficiaries with a contingent interest has been settled since at least 1808, according to the English Courts of Chancery.
I would point your attention to Allen versus Allen.
This is 33 English Reporter 704. Here's what the English Courts of Chancery said and it is followed through in every case that I have seen. A present interest, the enjoinment of which may depend upon the most remote and improbable contingency, is nevertheless a present estate. Yes, that's -- you're talking about a contingent interest.
A contingent interest is an interest in a certain set of -- a certain property, a certain body of money.
A remainderman had no interest. That's right.
We had -- But he would receive not a contingent interest.
He had no interest in anything except the body of -- Where the -- -- and -- and what -- it's hard to see a difference between that remainderman and the interest of a beneficiary. Here's the difference. Go ahead. The difference comes both from the plan document in this case and ERISA. Let's start with the plan document. It's pages 60 to 61 of the Joint Appendix. Here's what it says.
And this is representative of every defined-benefit plan I've seen. It says, ""All of the plan assets,"" and that's not a contract, that's stocks, bonds, investments, ""shall be held in a trust fund separate from the bank's assets."" It says, ""the trust assets can only be used to benefit the participants, except as permitted by ERISA and the tax code."" ERISA and the tax code are very clear, they prohibit taking or wasting any of the trust assets, including the surplus.
So the point that's being made here to -- to -- to what I believe you were asking, Mr. Chief Justice, which is a fair point is, well, you may not need the surplus, so how do you have an interest? And -- and our core submission is that since the 15th century, the way trust law has worked is, it has -- it has conferred a property interest in the corpus without any case-by-case assessment.
But -- But you -- you have some strong arguments.
I -- I want to get this one question in before your time is up. And you have arguments based on of Congress having granted a right to sue, and you have arguments based on the -- the -- the analogy between trust law and ERISA, but an ERISA plan is not a trust in the normal sense of the word.
But put all of that aside.
I want to hear about practicalities. So let's say a beneficiary of a defined-benefit plan comes to you and says: I don't know anything about ERISA, I don't even know what it means, I don't know anything about trust law or the 15th century, anything like that. What I want you to tell me is, what is the practical chance -- this is the beneficiary of this plan -- that I'm not going to get paid my benefits? What do you tell that person? So that -- that's a -- a -- a totally fair question, and let me answer it in the context of this case.
And I mean this very seriously. If you look at our complaint, Joint Appendix page 90, paragraph 167, we pled, because we believe that there was a substantial increased risk of default here, there was $750 million less. But you pled -- In answering the -- You pled that, but compliance with Article III has to be reassessed at different stages of the -- of the proceeding. Is there any -- is the risk greater than the risk of being hit by a meteorite? This is my core point, Justice Alito.
As -- I think the best example of this is the Pension Rights Center's brief. They explain, based up on their experience that the swings in funding and -- of -- of defined-benefit plans changes incredibly quickly.
The Harley case out of the Eighth Circuit.
In one year, there was a $600 million contribution but the plan was 800 billion -- $800 billion dollars underfunded. Well, that -- Because of -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Because of that, the -- the -- Congress exercised their judgment to say we are going to confer a property interest in the entirety of the trust corpus so we don't have to do a case-by-case assessment.
The -- But Congress made clear that not only the plan but the employer and then the PBGC, which you haven't mentioned at all, is in play here.
And the combination of the plan, the employer, and the PBGC, doesn't that make the practical answer to Justice Alito's question -- Well, I don't think -- that's a fair point.
I don't think so at all. The PBGC, which has its own solvency issues -- It does, but it's backed by the United States Government. Not the full faith and credit of the government.
It's -- what happens is there are premium payments so it doesn't function that way.
But more importantly, the PBGC doesn't fund anything above a minimum set of benefits.
The core -- here's the answer to the core practical question. But they exceed the benefits of your clients in this case. There -- there are two things going on here right now.
I want to be very -- Is that -- MR. STRIS -- clear -- Is that yes? Yes, my two clients, yes. But there's two things going on here, Justice Kavanaugh, and it's really important to separate them out: What matters for standing and what -- why we care practically.
I am answering the latter one. And what I'm saying is, in any individual case, you don't know whether you're going to need the surplus until it's gone.
I think if -- if the financial collapse in AIG and Lehman tells us anything, it's that. So if I am right that Congress said, in exchange for a tax benefit, you have to put all of these assets in trust, you have to confer a property interest in the full -- the full trust, I have -- I'm right on standing and there's -- there's an Article III injury, you don't have to inquire into the risk, but I also have a practical answer that doesn't matter for standing but, so that you don't have heartburn, you can see why a sensible policy-maker would make that decision.
That's precisely what they did. And that's precisely how many types of analogous trusts worked in an unbroken line of cases since the 15th century. Before you -- you finish, can you clarify the precise actions of the fiduciary that you are assailing in this case? Yes. First the district court said that to challenge to the 100 percent equity investment is off the table because it's time-barred.
So I think that that's out of the case. I -- I don't agree. All right.
Then tell -- tell me -- and then as far as the bank-affiliated funds, they say that they -- the bank says you long ago got rid of all of them. So here's what happened, Justice Ginsburg, and this is critical of the procedural posture. May I answer, Your Honor? Briefly. I'll be -- I'll be brief. The -- the first claim, the equities, was dismissed on statute of limitations grounds prior to this Court's decision in Tibble.
We appealed.
The court never -- the court of appeals never reached the question because it held that we have no standing. So you don't assume in doing the standing analysis that that claim is gone.
The only reason that it's gone is because we weren't able to appeal it.
Based on this Court's decision in Tibble, it will clearly be reversed. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Joshi. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When a trustee breaches his fiduciary duties and causes losses to the trust, real money losses, the beneficiary always has been able to sue the trustee for the breach of trust. It's been the law for hundreds of years of trust law and it's expressly in ERISA's text as well. And that rule makes really good sense. The beneficiaries are the ones who are getting paid out of the trust.
The beneficiaries are the ones, as this Court recognized in Russell, who have an interest in the financial integrity of the trust.
And the beneficiaries are in the best position to monitor and police the trustee for breaches of trust. And that's why the traditional rule, as my friend mentioned earlier, is that even contingent beneficiaries could sue a trustee. But the rule goes even further than that.
If you read the treatises, even discretionary beneficiaries could sue a trustee for breach of trust.
These are beneficiaries who have absolutely no entitlement to any trust assets, except those that the trustee in his own discretion will give to the beneficiary. Nevertheless, a breach of trust would allow the beneficiary to sue that very trustee. That history, I think, decides this case.
We -- Let me propose a hypothetical then about the defined contribution plans.
Let's say the trustee is left with discretion.
After everybody is paid, if there's extra, you can throw it to somebody, even though it's not in their own contribution plan. So I think you would say the result would be that every single beneficiary could sue, even if all of their investments are clean, for somebody else's defined contribution plan where the -- where the -- where the plan might be dirty; is that right? Does that follow? I -- I think that might follow, and I think it might -- I -- I -- I do think it might and I think that comes from not only our -- our -- you know, the positions we've laid out in the case in trust law and the undifferentiated assets but also from this Court's decision in LaRue. In LaRue, of course, this Court held that the plaintiff, who was suing over harms to his own account, nevertheless could maintain a suit under 502(a)(2) for harm to the entire trust because the trust included the account, the account was part of the trust. So I think on that theory, then, if you just extend it, that would have to be the logic.
My answer would have to be yes.
But -- I want to -- Everybody could sue for everything. -- I want to hasten to add that, as a practical matter, these cases, especially in the posture you just mentioned, are -- are going to arise in the class context, and I think it would be perfectly reasonable for a court to look at that and -- What about -- what about Justice Alito's meteor, the likelihood of getting a discretionary benefit from the trustee might be less than the chance of being hit by a meteor? Would Article III have something to say there? Or are you saying -- suggesting now, everybody can sue for everything anyway? So, historically, trust law has allowed the beneficiary to sue the trustee, a discretionary beneficiary to do so. And one might imagine when you sue the trustee, he's probably not likely to exercise his discretion in your favor; but, nevertheless, you were allowed to sue. What Article III has to say about it -- and -- and I know there's a lot of doctrine around Article III, but I think the key point, and -- and Spokeo reiterated it and 50 years of case law has reiterated it, it comes from the words ""cases and controversies"" in the text of the Constitution.
And the meaning of those words at a minimum includes the cases and controversies heard in the courts of Westminster and in the colonies at the -- But isn't that -- -- time of the founding. -- the -- I'm sorry.
The tension in this case as I see it, and I think it's a close case, is the history is strong but the answer to the question -- it's 99.99 percent certain that the benefits promised are going to be there.
And how do we resolve what I see as that tension? Because it -- it would be odd for us to grant standing in a case where the -- the chances are so small. On the other hand, you're right about the history.
I mean, you make a good point about the history. Yeah, I -- I -- I think the answer really is the history, but to the extent, you know, there's a chance, I guess I have two answers to that.
One is this Court has and -- and certainly the ""no further inquiry"" cases made clear that even when the trust benefits from a particular breach of duty, you still have standing, if you will, to sue. And, you know, one case out of many that we cited is Magruder against Drury.
That's a decision of this Court in which the trustee was making loans on trust notes and allowing the trust to -- to acquire those notes, and it was on -- there was no question that it was on beneficial terms and there was no question that the trust benefited because it could make these reinvestments and save brokerage fees.
That -- those are in the facts of -- of the decision of this Court.
Nevertheless, the Court said that, you know, not only did the beneficiaries have standing to sue -- it didn't discuss standing -- but they -- they were entitled to recover.
So that's one answer. The other answer to your -- to your question is, no matter how low the risk might be as my friend mentioned -- PBGC tells me that plans that are highly overfunded the next year become underfunded.
So as a practical matter, you don't know and, more importantly -- What is -- what is the role -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but the PBGC, how should we think about that, if we get away from the history at all, its role and how it guarantees a back stop? I -- I don't think it matters at all.
No one ever suggested that the mere fact that you might have insurance means you don't have standing to sue someone for the harms -- It's the -- -- they've caused. It's the combination of the plan plus the employer plus the PBGC would all have to -- You -- the fact that there may be many layers of insurance, if you will, doesn't change the fact that when a trustee breaches his fiduciary duties, you can sue.
And then -- And how -- how far with you push the analogy to trust law in this? Since -- it -- was there a trust where the settlor of the trust had an obligation to step in and increase the amount of money in the trust in order to -- to ensure that beneficiaries would be paid? Not -- not to my knowledge.
And -- I mean, that's the big difference between the situation here and trust law, right? I -- I don't think it's different.
I don't think it's a distinction that -- that makes any practical difference, at least for Article III.
It is an additional protection that the drafters of ERISA wanted to make, in addition to making the plan its own entity.
Those are all additional protections for beneficiaries, precisely because in Congress's judgment, as this Court laid out in footnote 8 of Russell, trust law was not protective enough of beneficiaries. And -- and here's is the point -- and this is to finish my answer to -- to your question, Justice Kavanaugh -- to merely say it's highly likely you're going to get your money back is -- you might say that if, for example, to -- to pick up on my friend's analogy, you know, you were to loan money to Bill Gates.
You're pretty sure he's going to be able to repay your money, but the difference between having the repayment or the -- the money you're entitled to come as a result of a contract and come as a result of a trust is very different. You get a very meaningful benefit from having your money come from a trust.
And that is it's managed by a fiduciary -- All right.
Can you just give me -- do you want to finish? Go ahead. Yeah.
Sure. All right.
Just don't spend more than 15 seconds.
But what in the law -- see, the stock market goes up and down.
And every time it goes down, it's underfunded.
Every time it goes up, it's overfunded.
Okay? Once it's overfunded, everybody's just as well off as they were before. Now, that happens probably quite a lot.
Now, if we -- if you -- what in the law prevents a class action every time it goes down and then it goes back up and they're better off, and you say, well, now we're talking about yesterday? What prevents -- something should prevent that.
Now, what is it that prevents that? Well, I -- I'm not certain what context you're talking about. I'm just saying the standing thing might be one of the things that prevents that because -- I mean, I -- and you can say, well, they have to have a good case, dah-dah-dah.
All right, I understand that. But, what -- is there anything else in the law that, except this standing business, that can protect against that? If you have suffered an injury of a peppercorn, you have standing to sue.
Now, you -- there might not be -- But that's -- But the other thing is that -- -- of course, I want to say, okay, your answer is nothing protects in the law. Well, again, it -- it's hard to answer that question in the abstract. What I do know is that, in this particular context, there are trust duties that are set forth in the law -- I know -- -- of trust -- -- there's some, but this is a duty of prudence, which means you made a bad investment that -- and you do make bad investments and you say, well, the trustees say dah-dah-dah.
Okay.
But I wonder if there is anything that prevents against the roller coaster which would mean many, many suits, even though the beneficiaries are even better off sometimes after the stock market's finished its little roller coaster.
So you're saying nothing? Okay.
I got the answer. Well -- Aren't you saying -- What I'm -- I'm sorry, aren't you saying the deference afforded to the plan administrators on the merits is -- That -- that's -- That's one. If properly applied? That's one. That's exactly right.
And I think to -- to -- if you just look at it, you know, the -- the funding rules in 303 -- Yeah. -- and the fiduciary rules in 404 and 406, Congress did not make these -- Okay, all on the merits -- -- to be exclusive. They -- I -- I -- I -- -- they all apply at all times.
It's -- -- I see. I'm not sure you're giving adequate weight to the -- when you're looking at the history, the significance of Article III to our role in the separation of powers. The requirement to decide an actual case or controversy is the only thing that gives us authority to do what we do.
And so the fact, well, you say in history in, you know, 14 whatever you didn't need to show that, well, that doesn't necessarily take into account how Article III works today under the Constitution. That may be right, but as I said, the Magruder case and many others that we've cited in the briefs do recognize this principle of trust law.
And I'd also point out that nobody disputes that if the allegations are true, that the plan's loss of $748 million -- if I may finish -- is a injury to the plan and the plan itself would have standing to sue.
But, of course, the plan's not a human being.
Someone has to sue on behalf of it. And when the trustee's the one that caused that loss, the one person who's going to step into the shoes to sue for the plan's injury is the beneficiary. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Palmore. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no ERISA exception to Article III.
Like all plaintiffs in federal court, those with ERISA claims must demonstrate injury. Neither Petitioner here can do that. This month, Petitioner James Thole will receive a pension payment of $2,198.38, just as he has every month since his retirement from U.S. Bank.
And Petitioner Sherry Smith will receive the same $42.26 payment she has received since her retirement. If this Court affirms dismissal of all of their claims, it is undisputed that those payments will be exactly the same every month for the rest of their lives, not one penny less. If, on the other hand, this Court were to reverse, this case were to be litigated to judgment in favor of plaintiffs and they were to receive every single form of relief they demand, those payments would also be exactly the same, not one penny more. Federal courts are not available to adjudicate claims like this that do not matter to the plaintiffs.
Whether viewed as a matter of Article III or statutory standing, none of Petitioners' arguments solve that fundamental problem with their case. First, at trust law, beneficiaries could sue to challenge fiduciary breaches only when they affected their interests, unharmed beneficiaries could not sue. Second, Petitioners lack any property interest in the trust underlying this defined-benefit pension plan.
That is because, as this Court explained in Hughes Aircraft, their level of benefits is unconnected with the value of the assets in the trust corpus. U.S. Bank, not a participant, bears the risk of loss from poor performance and U.S. Bank, not a participant, benefits from plan overfunding. Third, Petitioners cannot sue in a representational capacity on behalf of the plan unless they have their own injury.
In fact, for the reasons just stated, they don't. Mr. Stris started off by saying they have a property interest in the plan, but under the structure of ERISA and under Hughes Aircraft, they don't.
The trustee owns legal title of the plan and owns -- and the equitable interest in the plan is -- is the plan itself holds the equitable interest in the plan. The -- and this -- the fact that they have no right to sue over the fluctuations, the ups and downs in the value in the trust corpus is actually entirely consistent with the history at trust law.
They don't have a contingent interest in the plan in the sense of if A happens, they may inherit all of the trust corpus or if B happens, their benefits may get up -- may -- may go up. They have no such interest.
And at trust law, a plaintiff or a beneficiary whose interest was completely unconnected to the value of the trust could not sue.
And we've cited the -- Bogert, section 871 for that proposition, the restatement second on torts, section 214, comment B, all stand for that proposition. That's -- it's a different situation if you have a contingent beneficiary situation where there are two beneficiaries -- Can you imagine a -- a situation in which a participant in a defined-benefit plan would have standing? And can you describe the particular line that would separate that from this case? Yes, Your Honor.
I think a -- a participant in a defined-benefit plan would have standing consistent with normal black letter Article III principles if they could show that there was a risk to their benefits. And how would they show that? How would they show that? Well, they could show, A, I'm not getting paid what I was promised. Okay.
Put aside the not getting paid.
But if they're still getting paid -- Right. -- how would they show what are the particulars that you think would be necessary? Well, I think -- you know, I don't think -- first of all, I would just preface my remarks by saying I don't think this case calls for -- I understand that. -- the Court to opine on that because they've said that there's no risk at all that's required. But I think this Court -- I think it would be simple factual application of Clapper where the Court talked about imminent risk or a substantial risk. Right.
I know the terms.
I'm just trying to figure out how -- Well, I think -- -- to assess -- -- and I think those terms are flexible enough to take into account the long-term time horizon of a pension plan. So I don't think you'd have to show that the plan was going to fail tomorrow, but I think it's not -- wouldn't be enough to show that the plan was simply underfunded.
The Fifth Circuit -- Well, let me pause there.
What's the delta between you can take into account the long-term likelihood -- Well, I think you have to look -- -- and underfunded.
It seems like pleading.
I guess my point is pleading what you think is necessary won't be as big a hurdle as you're really implying, I don't think. Well, I think you would have to plead not only was the plan at risk but that the employer either could not or would not fulfill its legal obligation to make up any deficit in the plan. So the Fifth Circuit's case in Lee versus Verizon is instructive here.
That was post-Spokeo, that was a GVR case in which the -- that -- the Verizon pension plan was actually only 66 percent funded.
But what the Fifth Circuit said was that the plaintiffs there hadn't adequately alleged injury because they hadn't alleged that Verizon, one of the biggest companies in the country, would be unable to fulfill its legal obligations to make up that deficit and to -- Well, we've had -- -- make good on their payments. In the not too far off past, there have been situations where people were surprised of some of the companies that turned out not to have enough money to go forward. And it -- let's say that the -- a person running the trust or the, you know, running the company loses $100 million in the first month and 100 in the second and 100 in the third, and although there is no significant harm to the beneficiaries in the terms that you've discussed it, they look and say: Well, this guy is going to continue to lose a lot of money and can you -- can they bring a suit in that case? If they could show he's going to continue to lose a lot of money and it will result in an impairment of their only interest, which is the stream of payments from the pension plan, then yes, they can bring a suit and they can get an injunction to have him removed. So, I've -- Here, they've -- I've -- -- never -- they've never established that or claimed that here. I'm sorry.
I don't know why we need all that, meaning there is a simple -- two simple claims here.
One, a breach of loyalty that they invested in -- in a vehicle that cost more money than was needed, and it was self-dealing, so trust law has always said, you can't self-deal.
You can't make money off of the assets of the plan. So whether or not they get something or don't, trust law has been clear forever that that belongs to the trust and the plan participants have trustees who are self-dealing, they're not going to sue for themselves, we can sue for that self-dealing. Secondly, the plan lost 750-odd billion dollars or whatever the money was, millions, in imprudent investment.
Now, whether we lose money or not, the plan lost money.
It lost $753 million or whatever the figure was. And, in fact, until you contributed 311 million of that 753, the plan was underfunded. You then came along and said: Well, we'll give that much, a part of that loss but not the whole.
And so if the trustees are not going to give the whole amount because it's not in their best interests, but it's in the plan's best interests, what does it matter whether the participants get a piece of that or not? The plan gets it and they're representing the plan. So I -- I guess what I'm having trouble with in this case is that they're right, whether they have a property interest or they have a representational interest, they still have standing. Your Honor, first of all, they don't have a property interest for the reasons I stated -- So, why? -- and as the reasons this Court stated in Hughes Aircraft, they don't have a property interest. Let's remember the following in Hughes.
They were seeking a distribution of a surplus that the court said they couldn't seek. And the reason -- But here -- Yes. -- they're not asking for a distribution to themselves of a surplus.
They are asking for a payment to the plan. Right.
But Hughes rejected that claim on the merits because of the structure of defined-benefits plan. But if I can move to the representational standing question that you asked, a party can sue on behalf of another only if that party has their own injury.
That's Perry versus Hollingsworth.
That's -- there are many such cases. So in a qui tam case, the relator will personally recover and get money.
In a derivative action, that the plaintiff owns a share of the corporation so any benefit to the corporation will flow down and -- and they will get a minute part of it.
And if they don't, this Court explained in Gollust versus Mendell, there's an Article III problem. With respect to the first part of your question, which is the no further inquiry rule, I think it is critical to understand there are two separate questions: How is harm established, and then who has the relevant injury to sue to remedy that harm. The ""no further inquiry"" rule went only to that first question.
It said that if the trust engaged in a transaction that was inconsistent with the duty of loyalty or was otherwise prohibited, there would be a presumption of harm to the trust and, therefore, that transaction could be rescinded. But there is always -- they don't need the presumption here.
They have alleged harm to the trust.
There's always a separate question of whose interest is implicated by harm to the trust. Counsel, on that, what if Congress had in its statute -- I know you would disagree that it did this -- what if it had said that every beneficiary has a property interest or a private right to a completely clean trustee.
Would that suffice for standing in your view? I don't think so, Your Honor.
Of course, I don't think you have to address that question.
But as Spokeo explained, there are limits on Congress's ability to provide causes of action and to identify injuries and make violation of them concrete. This isn't creating a cause of action.
I agree with you about all of that.
I understand your point.
But say you actually have a right, a legal right, creating a new -- and we know this is new, we admit it's new -- Yeah. -- but we think it's important, because whatever -- whatever good policy reasons, some of which we have heard articulated here. Well, I think this Court would look to the substance of it.
I think if they just labeled it a property interest, I don't think that would be good enough.
If they somehow tied the level of benefits to the value in the trust corpus, this would be a whole different ball game, and they clearly would have standing. But like we talked earlier about the questions about the contingent beneficiaries, if you had two beneficiaries at common law, they each had a 50 percent chance of getting the trust corpus, yes, they had standing at common law, because they did have an equitable interest in the trust corpus.
They might get all of it. Here we're not talking about 50 percent.
We're talking about zero percent. These Petitioners will never get any of this money. Mr. Palmore, regardless of whether it's zero or 50, if I understand your argument, you are acknowledging that if they have an equitable interest, then they have standing; is that correct? If they had a property interest in -- An equitable interest -- -- the trust corpus -- -- in the trust corpus. An equitable -- an equitable property interest, then, yes, a -- a loss of a dollar from the trust corpus is loss of a dollar to them, but they don't.
That's the critical point. So -- but that's what everything depends on in your view.
I mean, your argument just falls apart if we look at ERISA and we say that's exactly what Congress did here, was to give all of the beneficiaries and participants an equitable interest in the integrity of the trust. And I don't want to quibble over terminology, but I would say an equitable property interest, if -- if they did -- That's what I -- -- in the real.
Yes -- We're not talking about -- -- then perhaps, but they didn't.
The plan is -- has the equitable interest and the fiduciary duties run to the plan.
And, moreover -- And where do you -- -- what they are entitled -- -- get that from? What does that mean, that the plan has the equitable interest? I mean, the plan is the thing that there's an interest in, isn't there? No, Your Honor.
This is -- the structure of an ERISA plan, you have a -- legal title is owned by the trustee.
And the trustee holds legal title for the benefit of the plan itself. And this Court explained in Russell that the fiduciary duties run to -- for plan asset management, run to the plan, but even if you don't agree with that, I think the history here is still critical because at common law, a remainderman couldn't sue -- and this is Terry versus Allen, it's the -- it's the Connecticut Supreme Court case that we cite, Justice Breyer, the remainderman who had an interest in only the trust principal was a beneficiary but could not sue, didn't have standing to sue for mismanagement of that trust corpus because a bond protected his only interest, which was a certain payment. Here U.S. Bank is the bond.
We're talking about one of the best capitalized banks in the country.
There is no risk that this plan was not going to be able to make good on the stream of payments to these plaintiffs and that is their only legal interest.
It's getting that check every month. Now if they take -- Do you think that -- I didn't quite understand your answer.
Do you think that Article III is satisfied whenever Congress puts the label ""property interest"" or ""equitable interest"" on something? No, Your Honor, I didn't -- didn't mean to suggest that.
I don't think the label would matter.
I was trying to suggest that if it -- if it were substantively a property interest -- What does that mean for it to be substantively a property interest? I think if their benefits were tried to the value of the trust corpus, then they would have standing.
But if their benefits are fixed, as these benefits are, then -- and they can't show that any harm to the trust corpus actually jeopardized that stream of payments, then they don't have standing, just like the remainderman in Terry versus Allen -- It's a little -- -- didn't have standing. -- different though.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's a little different because we're talking about a predictive judgment, right? And the plaintiffs are going to say there's an increased risk of harm.
And, of course, in regulatory cases that we've done, we've confronted that issue. And how much of an increased risk of harm that they won't receive the payments is necessary, and isn't that just going to be a pleading exercise that prevents -- presents a whole new collateral set of cases trying to figure out have you pled exactly enough, increased risk of harm here? And I guess the bottom line is is that worth the candle? I guess, summarizing, if we don't have clarity on the line, is it worth the candle of trying to draw a line rather than just going with the historical approach advocated by the other side? Well, Your Honor, first just to put a footnote on it, I disagree that the history is on their side. Right. But I think it is worth the candle because Article III requires it, right? So Article III and Iqbal and Twombly would require proper pleadings.
So here they said -- I obviously agree with that -- Yeah. -- but you've been referring to these old cases, which kind of said you're out.
And you're not saying you're out if you're a participant in a defined-benefit plan. You're in, so long as you can allege a sufficiently increased risk of harm that my benefits won't be paid. And then the question becomes: What do you have to allege to that? Well, it's underfunded and, therefore -- and the company may go belly up and, therefore, that's enough. Yeah, I think if it -- if it was significantly underfunded and the company was struggling or was distressed and didn't have adequate assets -- That's just going to be a whole mess, isn't it? But that's required in order to show -- Okay. -- that you have a injury.
So I don't think it's a whole mess. There's a -- there's a ton of information available here. So you look at the facts of Clapper, those plaintiffs had literally no ability to demonstrate that their calls were being -- Right. -- surveilled. Here pension plans file annual reports with the Department of Labor, that's the Form 5500.
There's ample public information about publicly-traded companies.
There's a lot of information out there.
And that information here showed that even at the time this plan was modestly underfunded, U.S. Bank had $86 billion in liquid assets. But -- but -- There's a standard -- Article III, there's a lot of case law about what standard the injury has to satisfy.
And if you're analyzing this under Article III, that's not an open issue. Concrete, particularized, and so on and so forth that it has come -- developed through all sorts of cases where there's a challenge to the nature of the injury. No, that's absolutely right, so I think it really would be a fact-bound application of -- of -- of Clapper, of the imminent harm standard in Clapper or the substantial risk standard in Clapper, which -- which the Court talked about, but what's -- But, but -- sorry to prolong it, but it's bothering me.
If you just allege that it's underfunded significantly, and therefore in the complaint it says and there is therefore a substantially increased risk of harm I won't receive my promised benefits, is that enough? That wouldn't be enough. Okay.
What more is needed? I think -- and this, again, would be the Fifth Circuit's decision in Lee, which I would commend to the Court. So you agree with -- I just want to make sure, you agree with the Fifth Circuit's formulation? We do.
So underfunded isn't enough because of the way that ERISA is structured that the employer is always on the hook to make up any deficit in that plan.
So you've got -- it would have to allege both underfunding and an employer who was unwilling or unable -- That's -- that's -- -- to remedy the problem. -- that's in a -- I agree with the Chief Justice that I've seen numerous cases.
And whenever it's a question of standing and it's a money case, which this is, you have to have some injury to money.
All right. But we have two things: One, at least as to the duty of loyalty, the history seems to show that those were fairly typical trust cases brought, although there was no injury to the individual beneficiary or trustee beneficiary, who could have -- that's true of the duty of loyalty. Under the -- that's -- we've looked at the cites and they seem to say that. I respectfully disagree with that but let's -- All right. -- continue. I want to know that. Okay. But the other is this: There are exceptions to this harm business quantitatively.
The Sierra Club, I mean, their members can sue.
And I agree that the members have to have once taken a, you know, a look around Yellowstone or something, but, I mean, it's pretty minimal. And here Congress has tried to create an organization that involves pensions and, you know, the members that they list in the statute as being able to sue.
So why isn't that good enough? Why isn't it good enough that -- that Congress has created something like an association, associational members do have the right to sue, even though there's nothing more than their belonging to an association that -- that suffered? Shouldn't that be an analogy? Why not? No, Your Honor. So I am interested in both of those. Sure.
First of all, under Rings v. Bird, the simple conferral of a cause of a cause of action is not enough to confer standing.
And then what you were alluding to in 502(a)(2) and (a)(3), is simply a bare cause of action.
That's not enough.
There has to be an invasion of statutorily protected right and there has to be a concrete injury. At the very least, though, Mr. Palmore, that suggests who Congress thought the fiduciary obligations ran to.
In other words, this -- this goes back to this question of: Who really owns this thing equitably? Is it the plan or is it the beneficiaries and participants? And in creating those causes of action, Congress essentially, you know, indicated that it thought that the obligations ran to the beneficiaries and the participants, meaning that it's the beneficiaries and the participants who have the equitable ownership stake in the financial integrity of the fund. Your Honor, I -- I read this Court's decision in Russell to -- to be -- say exactly the opposite.
So 502(a)(2), which goes to claims for fiduciary breach involving plan asset management, which is what we have here, the Court was quite clear that those fiduciary duties run to the plan, not to individual -- But even Russell -- -- beneficiaries. -- said that beneficiaries have a stake in the financial integrity of the plan and then you have Harris Trust, which says that ERISA gives a fiduciary -- it makes clear that the fiduciary duty goes to the beneficiaries. Your Honor, what this Court said -- has -- has said in subsequent cases after Russell was that there are -- there are other kinds of fiduciary duties which may run directly to a beneficiary, so, for instance, the right to receive truthful information, but the Court reiterated in verity that the -- that the fiduciary duty with respect to plan asset management runs to the trust. But even if you don't -- I mean, isn't that a fairly odd thing to say the that fiduciary obligations runs to an abstract plan rather than the beneficiaries and the participants who are supposed to benefit from it? No, Your Honor, because ERISA was an innovation in that it created the plan as an actual legal entity with -- and a heavily regulated one, at trust -- at common law, the trust itself wasn't the legal entity. It was just a series of relationships between individuals. So -- so ERISA was an innovation.
But even if you don't agree with me on that, this question would still remain, even if the fiduciary duties flow to the individuals, can they sue if they are not harmed? So at the contingent beneficiary analogy that we have been talking about, if you have two contingent beneficiaries, either of whom could receive 50 -- might have a 50 percent shot at getting the trust corpus, here it's a zero percent shot.
None of these -- these Petitioners is going to get that trust corpus. And again, the -- Justice Breyer going back to your question, the no further inquiry rule involved only how you establish harm to the trust itself, to the trust corpus. In not one of their cases do they cite an example of a beneficiary whose concrete financial interest were not tied to the value of assets in the trust corpus, in not one of their cases was that beneficiary able to -- But if you don't -- if you don't have to assess injury to the trust where there is no injury to the trust, how could there be any injury to a beneficiary of the trust? Because there was presumed under the no further inquiry rule, there was presumed injury to the trust. It means sometimes you presume that there is injury to the trust -- Yes. -- when there isn't. All right, focus on those. Correct. In that set of cases, there is no injury to the trust.
And, therefore, a fortiori, there is no injury to the beneficiary. I would -- I would change your wording slightly.
There is a presumed injury to the trust. Well -- I know -- There is a conclusive -- -- we're saying the same thing. -- presumption of harm -- On the duty of -- -- to the trust. On the duty of loyalty -- Yes. -- there is a presumed injury to the beneficiary. To the -- to the trust. Oh, there's a -- To the trust.
And then any beneficiary with an interest in the trust could then sue.
So if it was the remainderman who had only an interest in the principal, like the plaintiff in Terry versus Allen -- I see your point. -- and that that interest was fully protected, that plaintiff couldn't sue, right? So there -- it's critical to keep those two separate questions in mind, how is harm established, is it either proved or conclusively presumed under the ""no further inquiry"" rule but there was always the second question, and this is Bogert 871, restatement 214, comment B, there was always a second question of who can sue to remedy that harm to the trust.
And there the trust law is quite clear that that ""who"" is someone whose actual concrete interests were affected. Can I go back to the particulars of your theory of what would be sufficient? Yes. You said if the plan -- if you allege that the plan is underfunded and you allege that the employer is unwilling or unable to meet the obligations, I think you said. Yes. Let's put aside unwilling for a second.
In alleging that an employer is unable to meet the obligations, how would you allege that? What do you think would be necessary? I think you would have to look at their -- you know, their publicly disclosed financial information and show that they -- that this was a seriously underfunded plan and that this was a distressed company and it was going to be unable to -- to put in adequate money or unable to comply with the minimum funding requirements that ERISA places -- And if that's -- -- on them. -- alleged, how can that be disputed at the pleadings stage or what do you envision -- what kind of process do you envision for disputing an allegation to that effect in a complaint? Well, I don't -- I mean, I think if it's -- if it's alleged with sufficient particularity, then -- then they've properly alleged standing and then there would be a factual question -- Yeah, but then you would -- -- down the road. Then it's a question of subject matter jurisdiction under Article III.
So it's not like Iqbal and Twombly where it's failure to -- a question of whether it stated a claim. Wouldn't you immediately file a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction? And that wouldn't be -- the determination of that would not be based solely on the pleadings. Exactly right, Your Honor.
And that's actually what happened here. We dismissed under 12(b) -- we moved to dismiss under 12(b)(6).
That was denied.
I think that was incorrect but it was denied. And then we made a motion under 12(b)(1) and the district court actually engaged in fact finding and found as as a matter of fact that there were -- there was no risk to these -- to the -- That's what I was getting at. Because the plan was actually overfunded, right? I think that's right.
You have a separate factual proceeding on whether the allegation that the employer wouldn't be able to meet the obligations. Exactly.
And that's actually what happened here.
The plan then was overfunded and the overfunding line, that's the line that Congress has -- has drawn, it says if you meet that level of funding in the plan, there's enough there to pay all the future benefits, so this plan at the relevant time was overfunded.
That was the basis for the dismissal here. And I think that -- And Mr. Palmore -- Yes? -- what do you do about the fact that these plans can be underfunded in January and overfunded in February and underfunded in March again? And what do you do about the fact that the health of even, you know, secure companies, if you're in 2008, all of a sudden it turns out they're not so secure after all. Well, Your Honor, I think that's why the -- the -- I think if a plan is overfunded, I think that's sufficient to defeat standing.
I don't think it's actually necessary. And -- and I think for the reasons that you state, if something is toggling between overfunded and underfunded, there isn't going to be standing unless the critical second step of the inquiry can be alleged or factually determined at a -- at the 12(b)(1) stage that the employer won't be able to meet its legal obligations to make the minimum funding contributions to make sure there's enough money in that plan to insure the stream of benefits. But just kind of speculation about AIG and maybe there will be another market meltdown, that's clearly not enough under -- under Article III.
You -- and especially -- and if that's their theory, they picked the wrong defendant because there were, you know, $86 billion in liquid assets at -- Under your theory ---- -- the time. -- the PBGC doesn't matter, correct? I think the PBGC does -- does -- does matter.
It's -- You did not -- you did not articulate that when you articulated -- Yeah.
Well, we articulated that in our brief and the courts of appeals cases that are all on our side do articulate that as well.
That's the ultimate backstop.
And that's funded through insurance premiums paid by the employer. So it's not what -- what my friend on the other side said, that the beneficiaries somehow had their own insurance that would cover the loss. This is part of the employer's obligation to pay these premiums so that there is an ultimate backstop. Wouldn't -- wouldn't that theory, taken to its logical conclusion, mean that a participant could never sue, a defined-benefit participant or beneficiary could never sue? No, Your Honor, because the PBGC guarantees benefits only up to a certain level. Anyone whose benefits are under that limit, they can never sue, is that your theory? That -- that -- it -- that would be a theory, Your Honor.
I don't think -- Is it your theory? Yeah, it is my theory. I don't think you need to adopt that theory here because U.S. Bank by itself was fully sufficient.
But to the extent, again, that there -- and to the extent that that's no employee or defined-benefit -- beneficiary whose benefits are at risk and there -- so therefore wouldn't have standing. First of all, that's not a reason to find that they're standing because there are other enforcers -- the Department of Labor, co-fiduciaries -- but that's actually a good thing, not a bad thing. It means that the employer stands ready to make good on the pension payments just as -- We're told -- -- the rest of the -- You went quickly -- I'm having a very -- You went quickly over the Department of Labor, but we've heard from the Department of Labor, they can't do this job.
It has to be someone who is able to sue. And it's not going to be the trustee because the trustee is the one who has alleged to engaged in imprudent or impermissible transactions. So the only one possible is the plan participant.
So the government itself is telling us Congress set this thing up knowing -- depending on the participant's ability to sue, because the Department of Labor just doesn't have the resources to do the job. May I answer? Yes. The Department of Labor has the legal authority to bring -- to bring an action.
Co-fiduciaries have a -- a legal -- have a legal authority to bring an action. Trustees can bring an action.
You have to look no further than this Court's own cases.
Harris Trust.
It's called Harris Trust because the plaintiff there was the trustee that was suing to rescind a transaction. And in this very case, there was an early claim about a securities lending program that fell out because U.S. Bank had taken action against an employee who had committed misconduct and had recovered that money for the plan. So there are plenty of other tools available, other than fiduciary lawsuits brought by uninjured parties. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Stris. Thank you.
Three brief points.
The first two have a lot to do, I think, with question begging. So the first is we have a concrete property interest.
If we lose that argument, we lose, but saying that we're uninjured doesn't do the work. Justice Alito, you, I think, asked a question that's very important.
You said, well, can Congress put a property label on anything? And I think that goes to the heart of this case because they can't and they didn't. Here's what happens in an ERISA plan: Private parties make a bargain with real private interests and real money.
A worker gives up wages in exchange for a promise to be paid in the future with money put in a trust as security.
That's all fact.
No one can dispute that. The question is do we have a -- an interest, my clients in the trust, and what is that interest? So let's sweep aside the question begging and get to the main issue. Our point is it's always been the case since the 15th century that we have an interest. At first, my friend doesn't dispute this.
Look at page 25 of their brief.
He says in the 15th century, chancellors began to recognize the beneficiaries' interest as a form of ownership, protecting it much like the common law treated the legal interest in property. This is why he spends much of his brief and he gets up here today and he says: Ah, the participants, the beneficiaries, they're not actually the beneficiaries.
The plan is the beneficiary. If he's right, we lose.
But he's obviously wrong, because the beneficiaries are the beneficiaries.
To your questions earlier, Justice Kagan, you don't need to look any further than the congressional statements of purpose.
Everything in ERISA says that to protect the interest of these individuals, we're putting the money in the trust. So that's the property interest. There's nothing abstract about it.
That's how it's been for a while and for good reason. Okay. I'm going to take my points out of order.
The second one is the practical concerns.
What is the good reason? Because I think there's a reason why the United States Government across a number of -- of administrations have endorsed this position of standing.
It's because -- Justice Breyer, you say imprudence cases.
Well, maybe standing should be a gatekeeper, because can people sue in every case, like when there's been a loss -- I get it.
That's a concern.
I don't think it should inform the standing inquiry.
Think of the flip side. The flip side is if their rule is correct, you will have to have, to figure out if there's an injury, a battle of experts in every case about the level of risk and potentially throughout the case about the level of risk. Entirely unworkable.
Again, this shouldn't drive standing, but if it's the elephant in the room.
And in situations of catastrophe like AIG and Enron, there's no solution.
We ask that you reverse. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-916, Thryv Incorporated versus Click-To-Call Technologies. Mr. Charnes. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of the America Invents Act, the statutory history, the statute's policy goals, and this Court's decision in Cuozzo all confirm that Section 314(d) precludes judicial review of the director's time-barred determination under Section 315(b). Begin with the text of the statute. Congress drafted the appeal bar to apply to ""the determination whether to institute an inter partes review under this section."" Congress could have written Section 314(d) to review only the determination whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the petition -- petitioner would prevail, but Congress wrote the provision more broadly to apply to the institution decision as a whole. Further, Section 314 itself instructs the director to look beyond that section in making the institution determination in at least two ways.
First, subsection (b) instructs the director to ""determine whether to institute an inter partes review under this chapter."" And more expressly, subsection (a) tells the director to consider the patent owner's response in determining whether to institute review.
And Section 313 says the patent owner in that response can present reasons explaining why the petition fails to meet any requirements of the chapter. In other words, the text of the statute makes clear that the institution determination occurs under Section 314 based on the prerequisites in the entire chapter.
And because subsection (d) provides the institution determination cannot be judicially reviewed, the agency's application of those prerequisites located elsewhere in the chapter cannot be appealed, including Section 315(b). Now the statutory history confirms this reading.
Congress knew how to limit the appeal bar just to the preliminary patentability determination.
That is, after all, how it wrote the similar -- the analogous limits on judicial review for ex parte reexaminations in former Section 312 and inter partes reexaminations in Section 313. The inter partes reexamination statute, former 312, although now repealed, is particularly instructive.
Like with IPRs, Congress included several prerequisites to institution in former Section 311.
But, when it wrote the appeal bar, it wrote it narrowly focused on ""the determination under subsection (a)."" Subsection (a) contained the preliminary patentability standard, which is a substantial new question of patentability.
That -- by writing it that way, Congress excluded from the appeal bar the agency's determination of the statutory prerequisites.
With the America Invents Act, however, Congress broadened the appeal bar in Section 314(d) to apply to the institution decision as a whole. And this deliberate drafting decision essentially refutes Respondents' reading of the statute.
This reading -- our reading of the statute is also confirmed by this Court's decision in Cuozzo. Now Cuozzo dealt with a prerequisite to institution that was not in 314(a).
It was in 312(a)(3), the particularity requirement. Nonetheless, this Court held that it was subject to the -- the Board's assessment of -- the particularity requirement was subject to the appeal bar in Section 314(d). And it's important to focus on what the Court explained -- why the Court explained it was subject to that.
The Court said the appeal bar applies to two different things.
It applies to the preliminary patentability determination in 314(a).
That is the Board's assessment about whether it was reasonably likely that the petitioner would prevail.
And it also applied, this Court said in Cuozzo, to statutes that are closely related to the institution decision. And in our view, Section 315(b) is by definition closely related to the institution decision.
After all, 315(b) begins with the words ""an inter partes review may not be instituted if."" Cuozzo had a part that, of course, responded to concerns that have been raised, I -- I think in the dissent, and says we -- our interpretation does not enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits, for example; such shenanigans may be properly reviewable and focused really on the narrow issue before it.
So how do we take into account that language from the decision? Right.
Well, the question is -- what the Court explained in Cuozzo was, for example, if the Board vacated -- invalidated a patent on grounds that were beyond the scope of an IPR, that that would be a shenanigan that -- that could be reviewed. That's a merits decision.
That's a step two decision.
That's not an institution decision. And I think it's important to focus on the fact -- on really the limited nature of Section 315(b) within the statutory scheme. 315(b) is not a merits determination.
315(b) is not a statute of repose, as it's traditionally understood.
Instead, it's a limited forum selection provision. And it's a limited forum selection provision in two different ways. But, Mr. Charnes, let's -- let's -- just to follow up on this, let's just hypothesize that someone has tried to undo this patent four times or maybe even more in a court of law, failed for various reasons every single time, and then comes to the director of patents, who has a political mission, perhaps, to kill patents, let's just say.
And it is clearly time-barred under the statute.
Let's just hypothesize that.
And yet, the director goes ahead and does it anyway. Under your submission to the Court, I believe you're saying that is a shenanigan this Court cannot review. Well, I think it would be -- it's correct that our submission is that's not reviewable.
The time bar is not reviewable and not immediate -- You just disagree that it's a shenanigan? Well, I'm not sure exactly what the Court meant in a shenanigan. As we pointed out in our brief, shenanigan -- I think it was a good-faith application by the Board of the legal standard, and I think -- I'm asking you in my hypothesis. Yes. All right.
The hypothesis, there's no good faith, okay? The director of patent has a political desire for whatever reason to destroy this patent and many others. But -- Just hypothesize that, okay? In your circumstance, you're telling the Court there's no review of that decision, I believe, or maybe it's not a shenanigan even in your -- your view perhaps. Well, I think there is -- there is no review under -- under 314(d).
It may be that it's an appropriate case for mandamus relief if the circumstances are as egregious as you suggest in your hypothetical. How would it be if it's not -- if it's not reviewable under 314(b)? Well, mandamus is only available when there's no appellate review to begin with.
So the fact that there is no appellate review -- So we're going to just channel all these cases to mandamus? Is that -- is that the upshot of your position? No, because mandamus is a rare relief.
I mean, it would only be reserved for really egregious circumstances like your hypothetical.
The mine-run cases where the Board applies 315(b) and makes a determination would not be appropriate for mandamus relief. And part of the reason is, as I was alluding to, is that 315(b) is -- If the institution decision is not reviewable at all, how would it be mandamus-able? Well, if it's an egregious decision and where -- So it's not reviewable unless it's egregious? Well, mandamus is only available in circumstances where there is no review.
That's the first step -- first step for the -- mandamus.
If there's -- if you can review it on appeal, then mandamus is not available.
So I don't think that excludes mandamus. I think in the circumstance where the director says, for example, yeah, we think this is time-barred, but I want to kill this patent for political reasons, that may be egregious enough.
And the Federal Circuit has indicated in a couple of different cases that mandamus may be appropriate in truly egregious cases in the context as to -- Do you agree with those decisions? Yes. Okay.
If that's the case, what does the work of -- of the presumption of judicial review do here in -- in your view? Well, I don't -- surely, we don't dispute that there is a presumption of judicial review. Okay.
You agree with the government in the last case that it's based on separation of powers and it is designed to ensure people that they're not subject to whimsical executive decisions? Well, in -- in general terms, yes.
But I think it's important to recognize, as this Court held in Dalton versus Specter, that separation of powers requires this Court to respect Congress's withdrawal of jurisdiction to the courts as much as implying jurisdiction where it should exist. Here, it would be one thing -- it would be a different case, for example, like in the first case, where the ultimate merits decision Congress tries to put or may put or the question is whether they put beyond judicial review.
This is just a -- this is a forum selection provision.
The question is, are these parties going to fight in the agency or are they going to fight in court? It doesn't restrict the time-barred IPR petitioner's ability to challenge the validity of the patent in court, and it doesn't restrict the ability of the director of the PTO to institute other mechanisms that are available, ex parte reexamination, for example, under Section 303, to invalidate this patent. So it's -- What do you -- what do you do with the sentence in this Court's SAS decision that says 314(d) precludes judicial review only of the Board's initial determination under 314(a) that there is a reasonable likelihood that the claims are unpatentable? Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we -- we think that that's not a complete description of Cuozzo, and the reason is because SAS Institute, the rationale for why there was judicial review was completely different. SAS held that Section 318 prohibited the agency's practice of only reviewing some of the challenged claims and not all of the challenged claims. Section 318 is a step two merits statute.
And -- But it -- but just this sentence sounds like it's saying what 314(d) precludes, and it does say only a Board's initial -- initial determination under 314(a). I -- I agree that it sounds that way.
We don't think that's a complete summary of what Cuozzo said. So you -- you think that that was just a -- a wrong -- a wrong sentence? I wouldn't say it was wrong.
What I'd say is that the Court had no need to describe Cuozzo more broadly, analyzing exactly what institution stage step one decisions would be precluded from of you because that was not the factual circumstance of SAS. SAS clearly involved the question of whether the final written decision addressed all the claims that were being challenged.
So that's the reason why reviewability was allowed in 314. I think you are saying it's wrong, to pick up on Justice Ginsburg's question, at least the use of the word ""only."" I -- I think it's not a complete description.
I think that's -- let me, Justice Kavanaugh -- I think it's not -- that's not the only basis that this Court explained in Cuozzo.
I think that's -- that's a fair point. If we took it that -- sorry. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Ellis. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress established inter partes review as a quick and efficient means for the PTO to revisit issued patents and to cancel unpatentable claims.
It proceeds in two steps, institution and trial.
To prevent duplicative proceedings between the agency and the courts, Congress established a series of prerequisites to the institution of such a trial. But, to maintain the efficiency of the process and ultimately to -- to preserve the resources of the agency and the parties, it focused judicial review on the issue that matters most to the system as a whole, the final patentability analysis and the final written decision after trial. Respondents' argument to the contrary is inconsistent with the plain text of 314(d), with the structure of the Act, and with this Court's decision in Cuozzo, and, ultimately, would give 314(d) the exact same meaning as its direct predecessor in Section -- former Section 312, despite Congress's use of markedly different language. Section 314(d) on its face precludes judicial review of the determination whether to institute inter partes review.
Because Respondents' challenge in this case is directed solely at that determination, the Federal Circuit lacked authority to review. I think you have -- I want -- Chief. I want to pose for you the same question that Mr. Charnes was asked about the separation of powers. As I understand his answer, at least part of it is more or less that this is small potatoes.
It's just about timing for -- for the institution of the matter and that the basic issue of the patent validity is something you're going to get to.
You have a number of avenues to get to it. Is that your -- do you agree with that view? I -- I do largely agree with that view.
I -- I think that the -- the presumption of judicial reviewability is primarily about congressional intent.
And so I do think that in a case where you have an express bar on judicial review, you've gone a long way down the road. That doesn't mean that it drops out entirely.
But I also think it's important in this case, and it would mitigate any separation of powers concerns, that you do get review at the end of the day of the patentability analysis, the -- the issue that matters most to that system and to the parties themselves. And I -- I do think it's important to think about the fact that Section 315(b) isn't a limit at all on the director's ability to revisit the patentability of any particular patent. And so, Mr. -- Justice Gorsuch, when you offered a hypothetical about the director who was just bent on reviewing the -- the patentability of a particular patent, I -- I think one thing to address that concern is that you're going to get review, judicial review of the patentability, that is to say whether the director's decision is correct or not. But you're not going to get review, though, of the question of whether the director could institute that proceeding in the first place, are you, especially after -- I mean, as I understand it, this patent has been challenged four times before, unsuccessfully. Even -- And, here, it was challenged successfully only because it was filed out of time. Even -- well, I'm not sure that last part is -- is entirely true.
Even where -- I thought the government had conceded that the -- that the institution of proceedings here was untimely? That's right.
So 314 -- 315(b) -- And that there's no review of that decision in this proceeding at all? That's right.
And that -- but the reason that it doesn't mean that the director was precluded from -- from reviewing the patentability of that determination is what my friend alluded to, that 3 -- Section 315(b) doesn't bar the director from revisit -- or from revisiting an issued patent. They could -- could have -- the director could have taken the exact same materials that was submitted with a petition for inter partes review, decided that the review, inter partes review, was time barred but then instituted an ex parte reexamination. Sure.
There are a million other things that could happen, but this is what happened and we can't review it.
Right? I -- I agree, yes.
It's -- And nobody will. And the patent has now been killed.
And there is no way to review it on the basis of its timeliness. What was open for review was that patentability analysis.
Now Respondent opted not to challenge that patentability analysis.
But, if it had merit, that would be judicially reviewable and then the patent wouldn't be canceled.
I think that -- So how about a situation where it's only discovered during the proceeding that's been instituted that a privy of the Petitioner was served with a complaint alleging infringement in -- that would bar this action if it had been known at the time it was instituted.
Is that appealable? No, it's not.
I -- I think that the Board -- Why? Because 315(b) determines -- speaks only and exclusively to the determination whether to institute inter partes review.
And so -- No, it has -- it doesn't talk anything about whether to institute it.
It speaks in a -- in a prohibitive sense. An inter partes review may not be instituted if the petition requesting the proceeding is filed more than one year. So it doesn't talk about the director's decision.
It talks about barring the action if it is -- Well, with respect, Your Honor, it talks about barring of the institution of the action, and the only -- I don't see the word ""institution."" May not be -- you're right, may not be instituted. Okay.
So -- so it bars -- and the only actor who is authorized by the statute to institute inter partes review is the director.
So I think it fits very closely with 314(d) that makes clear that the determination -- So if he learns during the proceeding.
So this is not sort of a jurisdiction -- this is not an issue that he can determine based on the papers necessarily. So he -- the Board at -- at that point does accept a motion to terminate inter partes review on the basis of newly discovered information. If the Board finds that 315(b) should have barred institution of review, it can then vacate its institution decision. But, importantly, what it does is vacate its institution decision.
It does not issue a final written decision.
And then that is a determination whether to institute inter partes review -- Mr. Ellis -- -- that is not reviewable. -- I think you have a -- a -- a strong argument under Cuozzo.
But what do you do with the language that Justice Ginsburg read from SAS and how would you reconcile SAS with your position here? So I think, as far as reconciling the decision itself, I agree with my colleague that it just wasn't at issue in that case.
The -- the limit on the Board's authority in that case was 318(a), the provision that -- that dictates the -- the contents of the final written decision.
So I think 314(d) -- But why would it not be at issue? Why couldn't you characterize the issue in SAS whether it was proper to institute review of only some of the claims? To be sure, that's the way the government did characterize it.
The Court rejected that -- that understanding of what was at issue and said that 318(a), a provision that -- that speaks to the final written decision, had been violated in that stay -- case.
And it wasn't very hard for the Court then to conclude that 314(d), which only discusses the determination of whether to institute, wouldn't bar review of that. And I want to directly address this sentence that is -- that has been discussed about.
I do think that sentence is wrong, and I think it's incomplete.
I think it starts -- it's important to note the sentence actually says Cuozzo concluded that Section 314(d) only precludes the 314(a) determination. Cuozzo concluded more than that.
And I think, if you look at the decision, you'll see that.
I don't -- but the reason that's not a problem is that it just wasn't at issue in SAS. And nobody flagged that because the -- the -- the statute that was challenged or that was -- on which the Court's decision was based in SAS was not either 314(a) or a closely related -- Look at -- -- provision. -- look at Cuozzo, and look at SAS.
Everybody -- I think several of us have the same problem.
In Cuozzo, I mean, the object of this thing, those words, seem to be that -- that -- that, look, there is a Patent Office making a decision about this claimed patent, and the closer relationship between the appeal and the issue on which it's being appealed to this decision, the more clearly barred it is. But you could have a reason for throwing out the patent that is terribly important, that has all kinds of implications, constitutional, a different unrelated statute, or maybe there's some others which perhaps none of us could actually think of, but we could characterize them generally. All right.
Then SAS doesn't say that's wrong.
It's just nervous about the open language.
And so it tries to take that and -- and narrow it somewhat by focusing really on the heart of what that was about, which is this individualized decision, which we know is barred, and now we have a statute. And this statute, well, it's not exactly just about this decision, is it? But it's sort of close, isn't it? And so what do we do with this statute? Because this statute talks about the general problem of complaints that were dismissed without prejudice.
And do they fall or don't they fall within those words serving a complaint? And that is a general question, and it goes well beyond this -- or well beyond it? I mean, I don't know.
So I'm saying, if you were me and you read it that way, what would you say? Let's look at this statute.
Is it a statute closely related, Cuozzo, or is it a statute closely related under SAS? And SAS doesn't use the words ""closely related."" But that's what it -- I think it's driving at. So I do think that this is a closely related decision.
As we've discussed, it only speaks to institution.
And if you have doubts -- Yes, of course, it only speaks to institution, but you could have a statute that said anyone who's 6'2"" can't institute.
That would only speak to institution, all right? That would be an important statute or an important decision. And so I -- So -- so the fact that it only speaks to institution isn't quite catching the point.
The point is, how general and important is it above and beyond this particular proceeding, this particular claim? So if that -- if what you're driving at is sort of what was happening -- discussed in the first case this morning, that questions of law should be able to be reviewed, I just think, unlike the provision at the first -- in the first case, there is no basis to draw that distinction. So, if you, at the end of the day, conclude it's just too difficult to figure out, as my -- as Respondent says, it's unworkable to figure out how close is close enough, then what I'd urge the Court to do is apply the provision as it's written. Well, how about -- If it's about the determination whether to institute inter partes review, then it's not reviewable. Under this section. Well, how about -- how about -- under this section, yes.
How about that? How about the fact that, traditionally, executive branch agencies have considerable discretion in evaluating the merits of claims in deciding whether to proceed with enforcement actions, and, traditionally, statutes of limitations or repose were deadlines that are clear and written in law, tend to afford enforceable judicial rights to citizens? How about that? So, as I -- as I mentioned before, this is not a statute of repose.
This Petitioner could challenge in the courts.
This Petitioner could -- could join another IPR that was already proceeding.
The director could institute review on the behalf of any other person. There are other proceedings, I accept that, okay, but there's always like state proceedings.
We don't do double jeopardy between states and federal law anymore. I -- So there's always another proceeding available to -- to -- to -- there's always another way to skin the cat. But this is the exact same thing. But this is what Congress wrote in this cat for this cat.
And -- and -- and I guess I'm just wondering again, with Justice Breyer, in terms of close, how close it is, isn't there always a traditional distinction there that we recognize in our law governing judicial review? This -- maybe there -- there is a tradition, I agree.
And, actually, Respondent argues that his reading of 314(d) would do nothing at all; in fact, would just reinforce those provisions.
But I don't think that's a plausible reading of the statute. And to address the ""under this section"" language, that language is used throughout the AIA; indeed, throughout 314 itself. But ""under this chapter"" is used in the same provision.
If we had ""under this chapter"" here, that would solve your problem. I -- I don't think we need that.
I mean, I think if you talk about -- just look at the text before that, the determination whether to institute inter partes review, nobody doubts that the 314(a) determination is part of that.
But no one also doubts that there are other parts -- aspects that go into that determination. So, for example, if you were thinking about a decision -- a court's decision whether to grant a preliminary injunction, no one would reasonably say that the threshold merits determination on a PI, that whether there's a likelihood of success, is the determination whether to grant a PI, even if you say the determination whether to grant a PI under whatever authorization statute you're providing. And that's what ""under this section"" does.
It does it here and it does it everywhere else. All it says is the petition filed under 311, the response filed under 313, the -- the final written decision filed under -- under -- or issued under 318(a).
That's what ""under this section"" does here.
It does not -- they don't use this language in a way that isn't used -- it's not used anywhere else in the Act. And if you have any doubt about the scope of this provision, I would urge you to look at the former Section 312.
It's laid out in our appendix, but it's also block-quoted at page 8 of our reply.
Petitioner -- Respondents' reading of 314(d) is to -- exactly what 312(c) said, that the determination under subsection (a) is final and non-appealable. But, if Congress wanted to do that, there's just no reason at all for it to have changed the language and for it to have used a phrase that just doesn't sensibly describe only the threshold merits determination. So you really have a choice of giving ""under this section"" not a great deal of meaning that clarifies the authority, or you have a choice of giving a meaning that it has nowhere else in the code and then renders 314(d) largely superfluous in its entirety. We don't think there's a -- that the -- that the former would -- the latter, rather, would respect Congress's choice.
In this case, it's undoubtedly a choice to preclude judicial review. Do you think it's ambiguous? I don't think it's ambiguous, no.
I think if there was any ambiguity in this provision, it was the one that was addressed in Cuozzo, whether it only applies for interlocutory appeals or after final written decisions.
The Court decided that -- that question in Cuozzo, no one is asking to revisit it. I don't think -- and no one took -- it was taken as a given in Cuozzo that it would preclude 315(b).
Justice Alito in his dissent said as much.
And I don't think the -- the -- at the end of the decision he was going back on that.
He just said this is the problem, and I don't agree with the Court's decision. But maybe one way to read Cuozzo -- and I take this to be the point of Justice Breyer's question -- is that it -- it goes beyond 314 but that it only goes to questions that are closely related to the reasonable likelihood determination.
So, there, the particularity requirement was reasonably related -- was related, closely related, to that reasonable likelihood of patentability determination, but timing is -- is less so. So I -- I -- I grant you that's one way to read that one particular passage.
I think if you look elsewhere in Cuozzo, you'll see that what the Court says, for example, on page 2141, is that it's the questions that are closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes, plural, related to the Patent Office's decision to institute inter partes review.
So I don't think that's a plausible reading of what was going on in Cuozzo.
And I would point out -- But what about the -- -- that it was 312(a)(3) that was at issue there, not 314(a). -- the -- in Cuozzo, it was a particularity requirement, and that was described as a minor statutory tech -- technicality.
But, here, we're not dealing with a minor statutory technicality; we're dealing with a time bar. So does that expression in Cuozzo that it was a minor statutory technicality limit it so that a time bar is -- is -- is -- could not be characterized that way? Briefly, Mr. Ellis. No, Your Honor, it does not.
For one, 312(a) was a meaningful limit on the director's decision to even institute at all.
So we think it is -- to the extent that's a minor technicality, this one fits into the same bucket.
It doesn't actually preclude the director from reaching the final decision. And I take the point of that passage in Cuozzo to be that we shouldn't throw out the Board's final written decision on patentability. The major -- the major question on a ground that's completely unrelated to that decision, 315(b) is exactly that. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Geyser. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I respectfully waive my two minutes but would otherwise start by underscoring the truly extraordinary nature of the top side argument. As we've heard today, as my friends read this statute, Congress delegated the judicial function to an administrative agency, gave that agency the unfettered discretion to say what the law is, and then instructed that no Article III court at any time at any level may review the agency's interpretation of the statutory limits on its own power. Well, if you're going to waive your two minutes, I'm not going to sit back. (Laughter.) The -- the point's been made, and it's an important one, about the separation of powers.
And I -- I will repeat a question that has been asked this -- this morning. But is that really implicated here when you're talking about a -- a time bar on something that a party is going to get review of anyway? I mean, the question of patentability could be put at issue in any number of ways. And I wonder if those types of very significant concerns, concerns that it is importantly our job to be concerned -- to be vigilant about, really do come into play when it's simply a question do you go this route or can you go that route and that the fundamental question that's at issue about patentability is -- is going to be reached.
That's not being foreclosed. Well, the -- the ultimate question isn't being foreclosed.
That's true. But the -- the 315(b) bar, this is not a minor statutory technicality.
This is one of the substantive safeguards that Congress put into the Act in implementing this very new procedure that is adversarial in nature. And it understood that this is a significant protection for patent owners.
And it's a significant way to divide the authority between the courts on the one hand and the agency on the other. So this isn't the type of provision that just is out there and it doesn't really have any effect in the real world. Well, but, I mean, I don't think it's what we were fighting over at Yorktown.
I mean, it's just a question of whether -- (Laughter.) -- as you said, the ultimate question, the ultimate issue that affects the property rights in a patent, it's going to be reached.
It's just a question of whether you use one procedure or another. Well, Congress viewed it otherwise, Your Honor.
Congress definitely could have put in the inter partes review scheme, something like it did in Section 303(c), and so the director can institute sua sponte if it wants to.
Instead required a proper petition and it categorically cut off the agency's authority to act if the petition is filed after that one-year deadline in 315(b). Well, it does, but you don't contest, right, that one -- if this Petitioner is thrown out, somebody else can bring another petition, right? Oh, hypothetically, they -- they could, Your Honor, but you would need a hypothetical future party raising a hypothetical future petition.
It hasn't happened yet.
And there's nothing in the statute that says that -- Well, but it wouldn't be rare to have such a party.
Quite the opposite, it would be common to have another party who would pick it up. And what your solution would -- would happen is that we go through the entire process, soup to nuts, and then we get to the end and somebody says, you know, the time bar wasn't applied correctly.
We throw it all out and we start all over again on something that we know by now is an invalid patent. Well, we -- first, we don't necessarily know that it is an invalid patent.
The patent office -- Well, we know that the Board held that it was an invalid patent. And it -- and it is reversed a quarter of the time.
But I think the important point is that Congress did say that the agency cannot exercise its review power for inter partes review in those circumstances. And it may be true that there might be a future party, but we don't know that yet. Congress could have excluded that. Well, Congress also said that there's no judicial review of the decision whether to institute. And, presumably, Congress said that for exactly this reason, that once that decision is made and you go through the entire process and you get a merits determination, given that throwing it all out is just going to land you at square one doing the exact same thing, that it was, you know, a little bit silly to go back to square one. Your Honor, I -- I don't think that Congress thought that Section 315(b) was -- was insignificant.
I think it -- they wanted it to have teeth. And just to be absolutely clear, the petition that my friends are raising on the other side says that no court can construe what that language means. This is a provision that Congress used to calibrate important interests. But, if we're -- if we're in doubt about, we think it's ambiguous, doesn't the nullification of the determination that this patent is no good, that's out there, that's what the Board thinks, that this should not have been patented, and we wipe that out, then you get another challenger and where the Board has already made the decision that the patent is no good.
There's something unseemly about nullifying the determination on the merits. I -- I disagree, Your Honor, and for the reason that if the -- if the patent, in fact, is invalid, then it can be invalidated in a proper proceeding.
And, again, it's subject to judicial review on the merits. And so it's not entirely sure that that patent, in fact, is invalid.
What we do know is that Congress did not want the proceeding to start if the -- the petitioner is filing it after the year deadline. Often what happens -- and this is not just a question of wasted resources, although we would submit that construing this provision correctly will spare unauthorized future proceedings that will far make up any resources wasted in this individual case. Well, what is -- what is the -- the -- the analogy that floats around in my mind on this is that judges and agencies start down a road and then they say, oh, my God, I made a mistake. And -- and we give them lots of power in the law to call back what they did and correct the mistake.
The obvious example last week was Rule 59.
All right? Now a judge, when faced with a 59 motion, says, my goodness, you're right, I made a mistake, and he changes it.
Now, in fact, the party filed that 59 motion one day too late. Okay? Now can there be an appeal to an appeals court that this mistake which was recognized by the judge shouldn't have been recognized because the Rule 59 motion was filed a day late? My guess is the court of appeals will not consider that kind of thing.
You get one appeal from the ultimate thing. Now this is highly analogous.
You see, they're saying, oh, we think that -- we think that, given all the other ways of filing, getting this in front of us, this issue, of whether we made a mistake, it's not what Congress meant that we can't hear it when there is a -- when there is a complaint filed and the parties say throw it out without prejudice, that that shouldn't stop us from hearing it. They might be wrong about that.
But that's like filing the 59 motion a day too late. And we shouldn't have review of that kind of thing.
All it was was an effort to correct a mistake.
What do you think? Well, this -- this is what I think, Justice Breyer.
I think that this is the construction of a federal statute.
So the question is not how do we apply a given rule with a given construction on a given day for a certain set of facts. This is what does an act of Congress mean? And, again, this is -- Well, that's true, of course, or could be true in many matters governing instances where judges or agencies call back something they did because they think they did it wrong. Well -- Would that make it somehow more reviewable? Well, I -- I think what makes it reviewable is the strong presumption favoring judicial review.
Again, it is exceedingly rare for Congress to enact a highly reticulated scheme that's restricting the agency's core authority for significant policy objectives and then says, agency, you figure out what those provisions mean. No court -- Well, you're -- you're right, it is rare.
And that's why we have this presumption and we usually don't think that Congress wants it. But this language is pretty broad. It's the decision to institute is final and unappealable.
And you're going to tell me it's in this section.
And I'm going to tell you, I mean, in this section is just the decision to institute, is in this section, but the decision to institute is final and unappealable. Well, a -- a couple key points, Your Honor.
I am going to tell you that it says under this section, but I do think it says that for a very important reason.
And under my friend's reading, that phrase, ""under this section,"" has absolutely no meaning.
You can take it out of the statute and it means exactly the same thing. In fact, you can replace the word section with the word chapter.
These are two very different terms.
And Congress knows the difference because, if you look to 314(b), they used the phrase ""institute under this chapter."" Well, I don't want to interrupt the rest of your answer to Justice Kagan, but would it be possible for the director to institute inter partes review under some other section? Could the director say, I don't want to invoke 314, I want to institute inter partes review under some other provision of law? Can he do that? Well, this is -- and there's an oddity with this statute, Justice Alito, in that there is not an express provision anywhere in Chapter 31 that expressly authorizes the director to institute review.
It's not in 314.
The institution takes place implicitly under this chapter, which is why, if you look through Chapter 31, you'll see repeated instances. And I think 314(b), which is ""under this section,"" is a great illustration.
It talks about institute an inter partes review under this chapter.
It is not as my friend from the government says.
It's just describing where something happens. But, Mr. Geyser, I think 314(a) does.
I mean, it does it in a little bit of a backhand way, I understand that, but it says it gives -- 314(a) is what tells the director when he should institute.
And so it's 314(a) that authorizes the director to institute, and then 314(d) says the decision to institute under this section, in other words, under 314(a), is final and unappealable. I -- I almost agree, but there's a very important predicate step, and that's, in order to get to Section 314, you first have to clear the gateway prerequisites under 315, including 315(b). And as my friend from the government concedes in the reply brief, this is on page 6 of the government's reply, they concede that if the prerequisite under 315(b) is not met, the director has nothing else to do, which means that the director doesn't make any determination under Section 314. And you're right that Section 314(d) is linking the determination, under this section whether to institute, to that determination under (a), which is entitled to threshold consideration.
It's looking on the merits.
If you have an eligible petition, does it satisfy the -- does the director determine that the information presented shows that it's reasonably tolerable -- But, if you're right, Mr. Geyser, what does this unappealability bar really amount to? When does it bar anything that anybody would want to raise as an argument? Because, if you are right, it's just limited to the substantive determination at the threshold stage.
But, by the time this is going to get to appeal, the substantive determination at the threshold stage has been subsumed by the substantive determination -- the final substantive determination.
So, if you're right, you're basically saying, you know, there's this unappealability -- there's this bar on appeals that applies only to something that nobody would raise. Your Honor, what -- what I'm saying is exactly what Congress did in Section 303(c) -- Well, you're saying -- -- and in 312(c). -- that Congress wrote that silliest provision that the bar on appeals applies only to something that nobody would raise -- It -- -- because it's been totally mooted out. It's -- it's not silly because Congress has a good reason to make absolutely clear that people will not interrupt the inter partes review while it's going on with a disruptive interlocutory appeal.
And at the end of the day, they won't waste the court's time with that preliminary initial threshold decision. But, again, Congress is repeating the exact same pattern that it did in Section 303(c) and that it did in former Section 312(c).
This is one area -- Do you disagree with Justice Kagan that it does no work under your reading? No.
It clarifies what the likely outcome is, and I think clarifying does give it significance. But does the clarifying do any work? The -- I think that -- In the real world? Which is what I took to be the -- her question. This -- this is -- all I can say is that we know that Congress thought it was doing work because everyone agrees that is all that Congress did in 303(c) and 312(c).
So I'm not making this up. If you look back and see what has Congress done in the past in this very area, it's done exactly how we're reading 314(d).
And this is an area, again, that all -- I think all parties to this case agree, everyone agrees that 303(c) and 312(c), former Section 312(c), accomplish only what Justice Kagan has pointed out. I think Mr. Ellis would say, well, that's true, but those provisions were -- specifically said exactly that.
If you take a provision that's now written much more broadly and limit it to that set of applications, which is essentially nothing, I mean, isn't Congress's intent being flouted? I -- I don't think at all, Your Honor.
And, first of all, the language is not markedly different.
And I think one would expect that if you're going to expand an appeal bar -- which, again, we're -- we're in very rarified territory, as we heard both earlier today and in the top side of the argument, of cutting off the court's ability to say what a -- a provision of the United States Code means.
No court at any time will have the power to read this and say what it means. That's -- Can you give any real-world example of when the bar would do work? The -- the bar would do work if a party came -- let's say that a petition says I think that this patent is invalid, as -- as obvious, in light of a certain prior art reference A.
And then the agency says, you know what, we agree; we're going to institute review.
And then, in the course of review, they say, oh, my goodness, we were entirely wrong; that argument was actually frivolous, but you know what, there's actually a different argument that would invalidate the patent at the end of the day.
Then I could see a party saying, well, wait a minute, then institution was improper under (a), because they're conceding that, in fact, the petition should not have been instituted, there wasn't -- So you think that Congress wanted, in a case like that where the Patent Board has found a good reason why the patent is invalid, to go back and do the entire thing over again because its initial theory was not the one that it ended up with? Well, what I think, Your Honor, is that Congress was not focused in a single-minded way on a single objective when they wrote this statute.
These provisions were heavily negotiated.
And I think if you see the amici on our side, you can see why they thought that the 315 bar is a fundamental safeguard to protect patent owners from both harassment and abuse. It avoids a situation where someone litigates in district court, they test the waters, it turns out they don't like how it's going, and they try to uproot the proceeding to the agency after the fact.
This is very important substantive protections for a patent owner whose property rights are subject to review in an Article I tribunal. And my friends have even conceded that that tribunal is truncated.
It is not providing an equivalent process that you would get in a -- in a normal Article III proceeding. But -- So I think Congress didn't look at this as some minor statutory technicality. Well, it -- it doesn't have to be characterized as minor just because it's not judicially reviewable.
We presume that the executive officials are going to follow the laws set forth by Congress, whether or not there's judicial review. We -- we do presume that, but we also presume that -- that they're more likely to follow the law correctly when someone knows they're checking their homework. That's true in practice, I -- I grant you that -- And -- -- but it's not that it does no work without judicial review. I'm just pushing a little bit on that point. Well, Your Honor, I fully agree that we -- we -- we have every belief that the agency will exercise the utmost good faith in adjudicating cases under this scheme, but what we do know from Mach Mining and from other cases of this Court -- But that's a way -- sorry to interrupt.
But that's a way to make the whole thing do some work under the theory that it's an important provision, 315. It does work in telling the agency don't do this.
There may not be judicial review, but don't do this, and the agency is presumably going to listen to that. Then the appeal bar, though, also does some work under this in that it knocks out claims -- it says certain kinds of claims are not appealable at the end, even if they happened in the rare instance, or maybe not so rare, to violate that bar. So both provisions do substantial work then.
What's wrong with that, looking at it that way? Well, I think -- I think what's wrong with it, again, is that you're removing any ordinary, traditional, normal function of judicial review to ensure that the agency's constructing the outer limits on its own power correctly. And, again, that's not a small thing -- But, you know, you -- -- I would submit. -- you cited Mach Mining, but Mach Mining was very clear to say, again, we usually think that Congress wants the court to police a -- a -- a congressional statute, but sometimes Congress wants the agency to self-police because it doesn't think that the costs of judicial review, and there are some, are worth it, given the subject matter, given the fact that in this case there's going to be review of the principal question anyway, and, you know, in the end, this is not -- it's not unconstitutional if Congress wants to say that the decision to institute is not reviewable. And Congress appears to have said that. Well, they appear to say it with respect to something, but the question is as to what.
And, again, I think it's highly unusual that Congress put this no appeal bar in Section 314, said it applies to a determination under this section, and there -- there's a ready candidate for what Congress had in mind, and then is -- But, under this section, the only section that deals with institution of inter partes review, any -- any institution of inter partes review would be under this section because there is no other section that deals with institution of inter partes review. Well, again, Your Honor, though, in order to even get to Section 314, you first have to clear the gateway prerequisites elsewhere in this chapter, including Section 315.
And, again, we're simply reading 314(d) to say exactly what this Court in SAS said it meant, which is it is limited to only the initial patentability threshold in 314(a). Now my friend from the government now concedes that they think that was wrong.
I don't believe they've asked this Court to overturn SAS.
We don't think that the Court was wrong. Well, it's not a question of overturning.
It's just -- I think what they were saying is that SAS dealt with one issue in which it was unnecessary to recite Cuozzo's full test, but Cuozzo has a broader test than SAS quoted. Well, to be very clear, I -- I think that we win under Cuozzo as well, but I don't think that -- that the reasoning in that statement, which is a very plain statement in SAS, can be limited in that way. SAS was addressing the government's argument that 314(d) precluded any issue bearing on the institution decision.
That is -- that is taking on exactly the same contention that they're raising in this case.
Their contention ultimately is that this Court might have adopted a different rationale and ruled more narrowly in order to reject that argument, but that is an absolute part of the core holding of the case in rejecting what the government eventually framed as their primary submission in SAS. But I also want to be clear about how to reconcile SAS with Cuozzo because I think SAS has already given us the pathway on how to do that.
Cuozzo was absolutely clear that if you have a fundamental challenge to the 314(a) determination, but it is using the tools of other provisions of the Act that are designed to get information to the director to make that determination, then that's what's barred. And I think it's clear that when Cuozzo said it precludes the initial patentability determination and any other statute that's challenging that determination, it specifically used the phrase ""that determination,"" that patentability question, that's what's knocked out. And because the -- that's because the ultimate challenge is to 314(a).
And that makes good sense because no party in their right mind would say I have no problem at all with the reasonable patentability determination.
The threshold was met. What I'm really upset about is the way that the petition was written.
That's a claim that will fail every single time.
There's no conceivable prejudice to that.
But that is the opposite of what happens if someone is violating a strict statutory time bar that, again, is phrased very differently than the phrasing that you see under Section 314. 315(b) is phrased as an outright ban on the -- on the authority of the agency to institute.
It says an inter partes review may not be instituted if those conditions are met. When you look to 314, it's asking what does the director think.
This is something that the director has the power to determine. Now that's something that the director can do if the gateway prerequisite under 315(b) has been satisfied.
If it hasn't, then the director has no power to proceed, which, again, we agree with the government on this narrow point; on page 6 of their reply, they say plainly that if that prerequisite is not met, the director has nothing else to do. And at that point, the only determination made by the director is -- is not -- Mr. Geyser -- -- happening under 314. -- I -- I do have some sympathy for your argument that a petitioner should be given an avenue of judicial review on a legal question, like the timeliness of -- of the application, but some amici point out a potential problem under your view, which is, if the PTO agrees with you on the legal question and throws this complaint out, that the other side won't have an opportunity to challenge that because the only power to appeal is under 319, and 319 requires a full hearing for appealability. So what do we really -- one way or another, we're going to preclude judicial review, the argument goes. Let me state -- Of a legal question. Let me see if I can give you some comfort on that.
There are always two questions that come up in these cases.
The first is, is there a provision that affirmatively authorizes judicial review, and the second, is there a provision that affirmatively precludes judicial review? So we're talking about 314(d). Now our contention is that let's say the patent office misreads 315(b) to say it doesn't have authority when, in fact, it does. It -- it reads one year to mean six months, so it's cutting off lots -- No -- -- of time -- -- just this case. Or -- or -- It reads -- it reads it this way, and the other side says you're wrong -- Okay. -- for all the reasons it earlier gave, okay? So -- so our contention, again, is that 314(d) would not preclude review. The question is what is the affirmative power to review.
Now it won't come under 319, you're right, there's no final written decision, but that doesn't take away the -- the potential to raise this under the APA, which provides judicial review for decisions where there's no other adequate means of doing it. It potentially could get review under mandamus, depending on the egregiousness of the decision.
And there is a provision in Title 28, it's 12 -- it's 1295(a)(4)(A), that gives the federal circuit jurisdiction over a decision of the -- of the patent -- of the PTAB in -- in the inter partes review setting. So there are lots of different ways that someone who feels aggrieved by a misreading that cuts off power that otherwise exists, and I don't think that would also fall within the exception, just to make sure I'm rounding out the answer, for decisions that are committed to agency discretion, because, if the determination is we lack the authority to do something because they misread one of the outer limits on their power as opposed to we're declining to review, for reasons of agency resources or we just don't think this is important enough to spend our time on, that's a different type of question. So I think that the amici on the other side are wrong in that respect. So what's so terrible about reading the ""in this section"" to mean what it says, which is that where -- where the director -- where the director -- what is the exact word -- where the director decides to institute an inter partes review, under this section, that's it, you can't appeal that decision.
That's the norm. And, after all, the director could do this on his own, couldn't he? The -- the director could institute -- Yeah. -- an ex parte reexamination. So -- so this then is basically a way, a little complicated way, but of the agency saying: Oh, my God, we made a mistake.
And what that section has is about (d), subsection (d), is don't review the decision, oh, my God, I made a mistake.
Judge, you review whether it was a mistake.
You review whether the patent should have been canceled or not canceled, but it's up to the director, really, whether he decides to look at it once, twice, or three times. Indeed, how do we know the director didn't look at it 10 times before he ever decided to grant it? So that -- that's a simple way of looking at it. Well -- And that -- that -- that -- that leads you to pretty broad language about what's -- what's pretty broad category of what you can't review. Well, again, I don't think it is -- is so broad.
And I do want to make one thing very clear.
The ex parte reexamination under 303 does not proceed the same way that an inter partes reexam or inter partes review does. It -- it mimics the initial examination process, it gives the patent owner vastly greater rights.
They get to interact with the office.
They have additional amendment rights. Yeah, yeah. So the process looks absolutely nothing like inter partes review. It's not just that they can say, you know what, we made a mistake.
We'll just switch -- we'll scratch off -- Right. -- inter partes review and rewrite ex parte reexamination.
It doesn't work that way at all. And it's -- Well, it's -- it's different, I'll give you that, but, I mean, it's focused on the same ultimate question. Well, sure, Your Honor, but -- but Congress decided in granting this new procedure that has a potent -- you know, a potent danger to patent rights that the -- the patent owners are entitled to significant safeguard and the main safeguard that they implemented are the ones in 315. Well, I guess the question, though, that -- that we're struggling with is, so what's the big deal? If you're stuck going to ex parte review anyway, why should we care? What's your answer to that? Well, I -- I think you should care because inter partes review is a very different process than ex parte reexamination.
And, again, if Congress wanted -- But somebody else can -- Spell that out. Spell that out.
Why? It's because, instead of having an opportunity for a single response, truncated discovery, you're in an adversarial proceeding.
You're before a panel of three PTAB judges who might give you an hour oral hearing. You get a long, iterative process with -- with a talented patent examiner who can say this is what I think is wrong, and then you have lots of opportunities to show them exactly why that concern is unfounded. And, again, the PTAB is reversed a fourth of the time.
It's not like this process, because it's so truncated, I'm assuming, is perfect or without error. Well -- But, if it's not with this Petitioner, it can be another petitioner. And -- and if -- And, indeed, even when a petitioner drops out under this statute, the Board can keep the proceeding going without the petitioner.
So the fact that it's this Petitioner seems utterly unimportant under this statute. Not at all, Your Honor. And I think the key is that if Congress thought that the Board -- that the Board can do whatever it wants, it would have mimicked the same language it had in 303 saying they have a sua sponte right to institute review.
This is a procedure that is keyed directly on there being a proper, timely petition. You -- you don't deny that another petitioner can just step into the shoes of this Petitioner. If they file a timely petition, they can seek review.
I absolutely concede that -- And you don't deny that if a petitioner drops out for any reason, the Board can go on without any petitioner? Assuming that it was a properly filed petition in the first place.
We don't disagree with that.
But, again -- It just doesn't seem as though this Petitioner makes all that much difference. Well, Congress felt otherwise in this heavily negotiated process that produced 315(b) as a fundamental safeguard for patents. But, again, why would it have made that judgment, I guess is the question? Why does it matter whether it's one petitioner or another petitioner? Well, because Congress felt that it was important in this adversarial scheme. Why? To -- to make sure that you don't have someone gaming the system, waiting out over a year or even in this case 10 years before they seek review, where you don't have repeated inter partes review petitions filed by multiple people trying to hold up the patent and prevent a legitimate litigation in an Article III court seeking recourse for infringement. There are lots of reasons that Congress would have had in mind.
But, typically, the -- the way the system works is Congress passes a law, the agency gets to enforce it, but this Court ultimately gets to say what those provisions mean. Congress thought this was an important provision.
Congress could have said: You know what, it doesn't really matter if it's timely or not, do your best, agency, and then we'll -- we'll move on.
But they limited this, located it in a specific section, keying it to a specific determination, as this Court has already recognized in SAS, and it said that only that determination, the one under this section, not under this chapter, is a thing cut off from appellate review. So I -- I don't think it's enough simply to -- to throw up our hands and say maybe someone else could come along.
Maybe they can, but maybe they won't.
And, even if they do, they still need to mount a challenge that the director is willing to accept. So -- and I would like to say one other point about the statutory history.
Again, I do think that this is actually pointing in our favor, not my friend's.
It shows exactly Congress following a -- the same pattern in cutting off a similar type of appellate review. It's very narrow. And I think that it would be extraordinary to presume that Congress expanded that in such an oblique, indirect way as they did here. When Congress wants to cut off appellate review and say that the -- the usual Article III function is delegated exclusively to an agency, where no court at any time gets to look through any of these provisions that Congress took care to articulate to limit the agency's power, Congress presumably writes in a clear and unmistakable way. I would submit that I'm not aware of any case that this Court has ever decided that -- may I finish? Sure. -- that would find Article III review cut off entirely based on language as indirect as this. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Charnes. Thank you.
I'd like to make four points. First, with respect to the language under the section in 314(d), other provisions of the -- of Chapter 31 make perfectly clear that Congress viewed the institution decision under 314. For example, 315(c) says -- refers to ""the institution of an IPR under Section 314."" There's similar language in 316(a)(2). So -- so we believe that's all Congress meant by that, those three words, is that institution occurs under 314.
The title of 314 is Institution of Inter Partes Review.
And there's no other provision of the statute that could plausibly involve institution. The second point, my -- my friend referred to several times the Section 303 and former Section 312 and suggested that they're analogous to what Congress did here in 314.
But that -- that's simply not true. If you look at former Section 312(c), what it says is ""a determination by the director under subsection (a) shall be final and non-appealable."" If Congress meant to limit the preclusion of judicial review to the preliminary patentability determination in subsection (a) of Section 314, there is no reason it would not have used the language that was already in the statute, that it was replacing, when it drafted the America Invents Act.
It did not do that. It specifically changed the language.
And that change has to have some -- some meaning. Third, my friend also mentioned, when asked, I believe, what work Section 314(d) did, said that, well, it bans interlocutory review. Well, that rationale was specifically rejected by this Court in Cuozzo, where it said it was not limited to simply prohibiting, you know, interlocutory review.
In fact, it would have been superfluous if that was the purpose of -- of the statute -- of the -- of the provision. And, fourth, going to your question, Justice Sotomayor, we -- we disagree that there's not -- we think there is an asymmetry here if -- if Respondent is correct.
This Court in Cuozzo said clearly that denial of an IPR petition is committed to the agency's discretion. And that means it's unreviewable.
And that's how the federal circuit in several decisions has interpreted it.
In the Wi-Fi One case, which is the en banc case that was applied below, the court said that a denial cannot be reviewed.
And in the Saint -- more recently in the Saint Regis Mohawk case, it said the same thing. So I think you've got an asymmetry here, which is that legal determinations made by the Board in the course of granting review, if Respondent is right, can be reviewed after final written decision on appeal. But, if the -- if the Board denies review on the basis of a legal determination, that will never be reviewed. So here, for -- here, for example, if the Board came to the opposite conclusion, it would not be reviewable. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"The first case we will argue today is Case 19-715, Donald Trump versus Mazars, USA. Mr. Strawbridge. Before these cases -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The subpoenas at issue here are unprecedented in every sense.
Before these cases, no court had ever upheld the use of Congress's subpoena power to demand the personal records of a sitting President, and no committee of Congress had even tried to compel production of such a broad swath of the President's personal papers, let alone for the stated purpose of considering potential legislation. There is a reason that this is the first time a congressional committee has attempted such a gambit.
It has long been understood that because Congress's subpoena power is implied, it is auxiliary and subordinate.
And when that power is deployed against the President, it must yield absent any long-standing tradition or particularly compelling showing of need.
The committees can satisfy neither condition here, and that should decide this case. The committees contend that these subpoenas satisfy the limits this Court has always applied to congressional subpoenas.
But their arguments would render those limits meaningless.
For example, they contend that this Court should ignore the committees' avowed improper purpose so long as they simply tack on a broad reference to potential legislation. They claim that Congress can use subpoenas to uncover individual wrongdoing simply because that will always inform the sufficiency of existing laws.
And they challenge this Court's ability to even question the constitutionality of the potential legislation that they rely upon. The committees' obvious overreach is sufficient to invalidate these subpoenas even in a typical case.
But the Court simply does not proceed against the President as it does against an ordinary individual.
The committees have not even tried to show any critical legislative need for the documents these subpoenas seek. Now it is no secret the relationship between the House of Representatives and the President is frayed, but this is neither the first nor the last time that one House of Congress will be at odds with the President. The rule that the Court applies here will affect not only this President but the presidency itself.
The Court should deny the committees the blank check they seek and reverse the decisions below. Mr. -- Mr. Strawbridge, I want to make sure that I understand the scope of your argument. Your -- your brief begins by questioning whether the House has any power to subpoena presidential records, but you seem at the end of the brief to pull back from that. You say that such subpoenas ""press the outer limits of Congress's authority"" and that there is every reason to doubt whether subpoenaing the personal documents of the President is a necessary incident of lawmaking. Do you concede any power in the House to subpoena personal papers of the President? I think it is very hard to imagine that the House is ever going to have the power, you know, pursuant to its legislative powers, to subpoena the records of the President because, quite frankly, the House has limited powers to regulate the presidency itself. So I think it's very difficult to imagine a situation where its implied power to subpoena -- Well, that's another -- -- documents -- -- that's another formulation for what I was just focusing on.
Difficult to imagine, reason to doubt. In other words, is your position recognized -- does it recognize in a particular case that the Congress -- the House may have such authority and that in such a case it would be for the courts to decide whether it's exceeded any bounds in that situation? Yes, we have argued that, at a minimum, this Court should apply the demonstrated need standard that it has applied in other cases when -- when -- when there's an attempt to serve process that targets the President.
So -- Okay.
So -- -- the Court does -- -- so you say -- you say there is some power, in the House, you think there's a high standard.
I understand the House to concede there is some limit to its authority. So it sounds like at the end of the day this is just another case where the courts are balancing the competing interests on either side.
Is that the wrong way to look at it? Well, I don't -- I don't think that we're asking this Court to do anything different than it has to do in an ordinary case.
We're just noting that the -- the restraints upon the powers of Congress are emphasized in this case because this is a separation of powers dispute. And although -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Thomas? Justice Ginsburg? Counsel, in so many of these prior cases, there was a cooperation, for example, tax returns.
Every President voluntarily turned over his tax returns.
So it gets to be a pitched battle here because President Trump is the first one to refuse to do that.
And, initially, he said because an audit was ongoing.
Now it seems to be broader than that. But the aura of this case is really sauce for the goose that serves the gander as well.
So how do you distinguish, say, Whitewater, when President Clinton's personal records were subpoenaed from his accountant, or even Hillary Clinton's law firm billing records were subpoenaed? It seems that in prior cases -- you say this one is one of a kind, but it seems in prior cases there was a much greater collision of interests.
Take the Nixon tapes. How do you distinguish all of those cases, Watergate, Whitewater, the Nixon tapes case, the Paula Jones case? Well, Your Honor, we distinguish them in a number of ways. With respect to Watergate and Whitewater, obviously, those are cases of relatively recent vintage.
And in separation of powers disputes, this Court has generally, such as in Noel Canning, looked back for a much longer precedent for the type of issue that needs to be decided, examples of -- of the encroachment upon the separation of powers. And the recent examples, there are just a handful of them that the House identifies are two recent, you know, under that -- under that stricture, as the Court recognized in Southwest General. Now it's also important to note that almost all of those cases, I think all of those cases actually involve cooperative efforts.
And as the -- as the Court recognized below, consent is not the measure of constitutionality.
In none of those cases was there a challenge to the scope or to the -- to the power of the legislative committee in that case to request those documents. And I think Whitewater -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes.
Thank you, Chief. Counsel, the -- I'm very interested, do you think that there are any implied powers for the Congress to request or to subpoena private documents? I think that there might be limited powers in some cases for the House to subpoena private documents, although the Court has been very clear in Watkins and a number of other cases that Congress lacks any power to just inquire -- Okay.
Would you define what you mean by that limited power? Well, I think -- I think that we -- we don't quarrel with the general notion that Congress has some implied power to exercise its legislative powers.
And we don't -- and we recognize that in some cases Congress has been able to seek information that would be directly relevant to its consideration of potential legislation. But, as the D.C. Circuit recognized in Senate Select Committee and Judge Livingston recognized below, most often, that's going to take the view of forward-looking information, perhaps aggregated information, and not an attempt to, you know, reassemble a precise factual history -- Well, it said -- -- of precisely what -- -- in the D -- in the D.C. Circuit opinion, it says that this sort of information or subpoena should be requested under the impeachment power. What's the line between the -- a subpoena, a legislative subpoena, and a -- an impeachment-related subpoena? Well, in Kilbourn, this Court recognized that -- that -- that they're two very different powers and that -- and that when impeachment is properly pending before either body of the House, the ability to subpoena pursuant to impeachment is coextensive with that of a court.
Of course, court subpoenas are not unlimited. But that has no bearing on this dispute because the parties -- the committees have waived any reliance on impeachment.
And -- and -- and -- nor could they.
These committees don't even have jurisdiction over impeachment. So regardless of whether -- Justice Breyer? All right.
I'd -- I'd like to follow up on both Justice Thomas's and Justice Ginsburg's questions. As to Justice Thomas's questions, are you saying that Sam Ervin's subpoenas, which were done under the legislative power at the time of Watergate, which were fairly broad, are you saying they were unlawful, that a court should not enforce them? Yes or no? And as to Justice Ginsburg's question, I would like to know why, since in Watergate and other cases, Watergate particularly, the Court gave contested material involving the very workings of the Presidential office to the prosecutor, why isn't whatever standard applies to personal papers a weaker one, not a stronger one? Well, if I can answer that last question first, I think that the Court cannot refuse to see what others see, to quote Rumely, and -- and the -- the -- the threat in this case of subpoenaing, you know, decades worth of papers, not only of the President but of the President's family members, of his children, of his grandchildren, as the House has done in this case, poses an obvious problem with respect to harassment and infringement upon the ability of the executive to discharge his duties 24 hours a day. Unlike Congress, the President is never in recess.
And these types of subpoenas are -- are -- are going to be particularly troublesome and burdensome. Are you saying that a weaker case -- look, whatever it is, why wouldn't whatever standard applies to personal papers before the Presidency be equal to or weaker than the standard for material that is the workings of the administration at the time? Well, setting aside any executive privilege concerns, which I understand is not -- not the focus of your question, the answer is because Congress has -- or this Court has repeatedly emphasized in Kilbourn and Watkins and everywhere else that Congress lacks any power to inquire into the private affairs of any individual. And that's distinct from whatever interest it may have in informing themselves about the workings of government.
Now that informing power does not extend to the President.
It generally applies to lower executive branch officials and agencies. Thank you.
I -- I see.
What about the first question, are you saying that the Ervin committee subpoenas were unlawful? Yes or no? This case -- we do not -- we do not argue that and we do not need to address the power of impeachment because it's not at issue in this case. It wasn't impeachment. Justice Alito? Counsel, are there any circumstances in which a House of Congress can justify a subpoena for a sitting President's personal records on the ground that it wants to use the President as a case study for possible broad regulatory legislation? I -- I think it's difficult to imagine for a couple of reasons. One is, even setting aside the fact that it's the President, this Court has always required some showing that -- that -- that the information being sought is pertinent. And I think that the -- the -- the swath and the -- and the -- and the scope of the subpoenas that are at issue here create serious problems even in an ordinary case. But -- but, to directly answer the question, no, the President's personal papers are not related to anything having to do with the workings of government.
And to empower the committees to simply declare him a useful case study is to open the door to all sorts of oppressive requests. You could have subpoenas directed seeking all of Jimmy Carter's financial history simply because he used to be a peanut farmer and they want a case study on agriculture.
You could have all sorts of requests for medical records, for educational records, any imaginable detailed personal records because Congress does have the general power to legislate in lots of areas. Well, perhaps before my time expires I can ask you one other question.
I think you said that Congress has limited power to regulate the conduct of a President. Does Congress have any power to regulate the conduct of the President, which is an office that is created by the Constitution itself and not by Congress? The answer to that, I think, is clear from this Court's cases.
It's not very much, which is why it frequently applies avoidance principles to -- to avoid even having to decide whether Congress has -- has attempted to reach the President. Now the one example, obviously, in -- in recent history is the Nixon versus General Administrative Services case, but even in that case, it was a very limited right to -- to -- regarding presidential documents. One could imagine maybe some hypothetical where there'd be some limited personal papers that might be relevant to a question regarding custody of official documents.
But, of course, even in that case, what saved the constitutionality of that statute was the fact that it was not seeking the President's personal papers, and that control remained in the executive branch, neither of which -- Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, there is a long, long history of Congress seeking records and getting them, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, from Presidents.
And in some of those cases, we have said, especially Eastland and McGrain, that a congressional subpoena is valid so long as there is a conceivable legislative purpose and the records are relevant to that purpose. I see a tremendous separation of powers problem when you're talking about placing a heightened standard or a clear statement, your various formulations of this, on an investigation that a committee is embarking upon. Now I understand your complaint about the Financial Services subpoena on the money laundering issue, but are you disputing that the stated purpose of the Intelligence Committee subpoena at issue, investigation efforts by foreign entities to influence the U.S. political process and related to the financial records of -- of that, that those were irrelevant to that purpose and that's an illegitimate purpose by the investigative committee, by the Intelligence Committee? Well, taking -- taking the relevance question first, yes, even if you accepted that there was some legitimate legislation that could be had that reached the President because what we're seeking here is presidential finances, when you look at -- No, we're -- -- the face of the -- -- I'm sorry. Pardon, sir.
Not presidential finances.
We're asking for his personal tax returns before he became President.
Those are very different things.
And we're not asking him to produce it. And some of the subpoenas that Congress, through history as far back as 1792, have asked for personal papers of the President while being President.
This is before he was President. I -- I -- I don't understand.
It -- it is -- and they're not his papers in the sense of he's not in possession of them.
These are to private -- subpoenas to private entities. Okay, so there are a number of issues there.
With respect to the custodian issue, this Court, even going back to Eastland, has always recognized the ability of a person who stands in the President's whose records are in the hands of a third-party to come in and challenge them, and that's certainly the case here. Well, that -- those papers all have to do with executive privilege questions, and -- Not in -- -- they're not -- -- not in Eastland. -- personal -- they're not personal papers.
That -- all those cases have to do with papers that belong to the Office of the President.
Again, these are personal papers. Well, Eastland -- Briefly, counsel. Yeah.
Eastland -- Eastland was not -- didn't even raise that issue.
Eastland was, in fact, personal papers. But, with respect, I guess the main point I would make is whatever presumption this Court has previously applied in cases that involve separation of powers, it should not put a -- any -- any finger on the scale for Congress's asserted legislative power in this case. And, indeed, in numerous separation of powers cases, starting with Kilbourn, the Court has declined to extend any presumption that -- that -- that Congress had a legitimate power. That was also true below in the D.C. Circuit in Tobin, in the Senate Select Committee case, and even in the AT&T cases. Justice Kagan? Good morning, Mr. Strawbridge.
I think what strikes me about this case is, you know, this isn't the first conflict between Congress and the President, as many of my colleagues have pointed out. We've never had to address this issue, and the reason is because Congress and the President have reached accommodations with each other, and sometimes one has gotten more and sometimes the other has gotten more, but there has always been this accommodation-seeking. And what it seems to me you're asking us to do is to put a kind of 10-ton weight on the scales between the President and Congress and essentially to make it impossible for Congress to perform oversight and to carry out its functions where the President is concerned. And you're quite right in what you said before, that this isn't going to be the last such case, and I wonder whether that fact isn't a good reason to reject your proposed rule. Well, no, I -- I -- I don't -- I don't think that that's the case because -- well, and for several reasons.
One, the fact that this is the first time that Congress has attempted to -- to -- to subpoena this scale and this scope of documents from the President, and none of the other historical cases involved a direct subpoena for the President's documents in the way that this one does, I think requires this Court to draw a line. It is unfortunate that the House did not attempt to seek these documents directly from the President or engage in any negotiation but simply ran to third-party custodians and forced the President to bring this.
Among other things, it has the effect of limiting the number of defenses the President can bring. But, even on the test this Court has always applied in this scenario, these subpoenas fail every hallmark of a legitimate legislative investigation. But I -- I -- I -- And whatever -- Go ahead.
Sorry. I was going to say whatever power Congress has to conduct oversight of lower branch agencies or inform itself as to the workings of government, these documents are not relevant to that.
And that power does not extend to the President, who is a separate constitutionally created officer. Yeah, I mean, I think some former presidents might contest the idea that this -- these subpoenas go further than has ever gone before.
And this gets me back to what Justice Breyer had said, is that, you know, these subpoenas are for personal records, where the President is just a man. They're not for official records, where the President might have executive privilege, where we have to worry about the conduct of governance and about the way the executive branch operates. And as with Justice Breyer, I guess I would like to hear your views on why that wouldn't suggest that there is a lower standard here, not a higher one. Well, because I -- I guess -- I guess because the -- the fact that they seek personal documents doesn't mean that they're not targeting the President.
And, indeed, both the Oversight Committee and the -- and the Financial -- or, I'm sorry, the -- the House Intelligence Committee have identified the President in his role as President as one of the motivating factors for their investigation. Secondly, as this Court has note -- has noted, even in -- even in Clinton v. Jones, when it rejected a broader immunity argument, there's still a need to ensure that the President is not going to face undue harassment or distraction and there's a necessity to accommodate him. We think that that's best accommodated in this case at a minimum by applying the demonstrated need standard, in which -- Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I'd like to pick up right there where you left off.
You argue that there is no demonstrated need, no substantial legislative purpose.
The House is before us, and I'm sure we're going to hear from them that there is a substantial legislative need. Why -- why should we not defer to the House's views about its own legislative purposes? For several reasons, Justice Gorsuch.
To begin, the subpoena power is an implied power, and this Court made clear, most recently in NFIB v. Sebelius, that Congress cannot use its implied powers to challenge the structure of government.
And a subpoena targeting the President's personal documents is a challenge to the separation of powers. In -- in Morrison v. Olson as well, the Court did not apply a presumption on either side of that dispute precisely because it was a battle between the branches.
As Justice Scalia pointed out in his opinion, there's simply no need for a presumption on either side, whatever might normally apply in a case against an ordinary individual, because the President has his own powers that are created by the Constitution. And then, of course, this Court in a number of cases, as we describe, has recognized, going back to Chief Justice Marshall, that we do not proceed against the President as we do against an ordinary litigant.
And so whether that was in Cheney, whether that was the limiting construction given to the APA in -- Counsel, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I -- I guess my question was more practical than that. Why is this subpoena not provide -- supported by a substantial legislative need? Well, one -- I guess three answers.
Congress has not really identified any -- with any specificity what actual valid legislation it could enact that directly reaches the President.
Even if it had, it hasn't identified how documents going back upwards of 10 years in some cases, completely unlimited, and seeking the most minute financial details, not only about him but his children and his grandchildren, every credit card swipe, every check, has anything to do with some purpose that would actually be permissible legislation. And I think that any -- any allowance of the case study rationale that the House has relied upon, or the Financial Services Committee, is a door that opens to endless subpoenas and harassment anytime one party controls one House of Congress opposite from the President. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Strawbridge.
On your argument that the Nixon demonstrated specific need standard should apply or the demonstrably critical standard, explain for me how that would play out in practice in a case like this. Well, in a case like this, obviously, where Congress is -- is asserting its desire to enact general legislation, I think it's going to be very difficult. I don't hold out the possibility that they could meet the demonstrated need -- I mean, I don't -- I don't completely rule out that possibility, although I think it is telling that the House devoted all of one sentence to each of these subpoenas, attempting to just assert very broadly that they meet the demonstrated need criteria. But, if there was some situation in which Congress was actually -- you know, had -- had -- had put forth a statute for which they -- they needed some information to decide whether to enact a statute, the statute was valid, and for some reason the President's personal papers were necessary to inform Congress, then perhaps in that case it could meet the demonstrated need statute. I can't imagine that any of these subpoenas could come close, given how far back they look and how much of a dragnet they set up. These are the kinds of subpoenas that the Court in Watkins said raise specific questions about whether they're really attempting to expose alleged wrongdoing as opposed to achieve a valid legislative end. Secondly, following up on Justice Kagan's point about the future, on page 6 of your supplemental letter brief, you say that ""it is likely that civil litigation over the subpoenas would have been foreclosed had the committee issued them to the President."" And you say this case is different because the subpoenas were issued to a third-party custodian.
And there's an implicit assumption there that I just want to make sure of, namely, that absent a court order, the private custodians plan to comply with the subpoenas even if the client directs or requests them not to comply.
Is that correct? The -- the -- the recipients of these subpoenas have indicated that they consider it to be a dispute between the President and the House of Representatives, and -- and -- and absent some sort of court order regarding its validity, they feel obligated to comply. And this Court in Eastland recognized that it's not -- it's just not reasonable to expect in this situation the third-party custodian to risk contempt of Congress or other collateral consequences, and there needs to be a vehicle to let -- to allow for review, especially in this case, where the President is suffering a personal injury arising -- Thank you, counsel. General Wall? Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: These cases are truly historic.
Three different congressional committees have targeted not the official records of the President but his personal records, stretching back years before he was even a candidate for office. The potential to harass and undermine the President and the presidency is plain.
It's not much to ask that before the House delves into the President's personal life, it explain in some meaningful way what laws it is considering and why it needs the President's documents in particular. The subpoenas here don't even come close.
That creates two problems for the House. It can't satisfy any standard sensitive to Article II and the separation of powers, and, indeed, as in Rumely and Watkins, this Court should not decide a serious constitutional question the full House itself has not confronted. Counsel, you spend a lot of time in your brief documenting that the purpose of these subpoenas was actually investigatory rather than legislative.
And if that is a pertinent consideration, I -- I wonder how a court is supposed to look at it. Should a court be probing the mental processes of the legislators? Should members of House committees be subject to cross-examination on why you were really seeking these documents? No, Mr. Chief Justice.
I want to be clear.
I don't think any of that would be permissible. All we are saying is that you should review the subpoena on the basis of the contemporaneous objective record that is the basis for the legislative subpoenas themselves. So we have not in our brief turned to legislative statements.
We haven't said that they should be able to get discovery into their mental processes or anything of the like. We have said that Chairman Cummings' memo shows the objective purpose's wrongdoing, but more important, I would just point to the mismatch between the breadth and duration of the subpoenas and their asserted purposes. I think, with respect to all three, they -- they don't -- they're just -- they don't match up with what the committees say they're doing if you look at the information they're seeking. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Mr. Wall, what if, following up on the Chief Justice's question, what if it was clear from those statements that you reviewed that their intention was actually to remove the President from office rather than the sort of pretextual reason that it is for legislative -- pre-textual legislative reasons? I -- I do think, if you look at the statements, and we haven't urged that, but if you do, yes, I -- I think they make clear that the subpoenas are not in aid of valid legislation. That's the only enumerated power to which Congress has pointed here.
The House has not relied on impeachment.
And so you would simply just say the subpoenas are invalid. And to tie that into Justice Gorsuch's question earlier, I -- I think we're not asking to go back and look at -- at what they said or probe their mental processes.
I'm just saying, if you look at pages 46 and 54 of the red brief and you look at what they actually say about their intended legislative proposals and then why they need the document, it's paper thin. They don't give you any specifics on what they're thinking about doing or any specifics on why they need the documents.
And that's not an accident.
It's not the product of carelessness or thought -- thoughtlessness.
It is because the purpose here is to expose wrongdoing.
And the House has never really tried to substantiate why it needs these documents in service of its legislative powers. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? One must investigate before legislation.
The purpose of investigation is to frame the legislation.
You don't have the legislation in -- in mind.
You -- you want to explore what is the problem, what legislative change can reduce or eliminate the problem. So, for example, the Ethics in Government Act, Congress may decide that it needs to beef up that legislation.
It may also decide that for financial disclosure purposes, there should be disclosure of tax returns. So those -- those are legislative purposes.
Investigate to see if you need legislation of that sort.
And then, to impugn Congress's motive, I mean, even the policeman on the beat, if he stops a car and gives the reason that the car went through a stop sign, we don't allow an investigation into what the subjective motive really was. So, here, you're -- you're distrusting Congress more than the cop on the beat. Justice Ginsburg, I absolutely agree that Congress can investigate in service of what legislation might be needed. Our submission is much more modest, that when that legislative -- when that inquiry involves the President, that you need a somewhat higher standard with respect to purpose because the room for regulating the President is so much narrower than it is with respect to private parties. And on the need side, because of the dangers of harassing and distracting and undermining the President, and that's a common theme that runs through the Court's cases, that the President gets some measure of heightened protection because you can't proceed against the President as against an ordinary litigant. And all I'm saying is that Congress hasn't met that standard here. Justice Breyer? How did that work out in the Paula Jones -- Justice Breyer? Following this up, assume, as I do, that for reasons set out in an opinion by Judge Griffith, that we're not very good courts at -- at deciding disputes between two powerful political branches.
So it should be rare. But, if it is in front of us, why not apply the standard that is ordinarily applied to every human being in the United States in respect to, for example, grand jury subpoenas? Any human being in the United States, when he gets a subpoena, can go to a judge and say: Judge, this is overly burdensome, and then he has a chance to show it. And, here, if it's the President, the Court's already written in Paula Jones two or three paragraphs of the kinds of things that -- that a President has that are special, special need, not to take his time, et cetera, but would you object to a decision of this Court that says apply that, taking into account the special needs of the Presidency, just like other human beings sometimes have special needs? They might be an emergency medical worker, et cetera. I would, Justice Breyer, on two grounds.
First, the Court and the D.C. Circuit have rejected the analogy to grand jury subpoenas served by prosecutors.
These are legislative subpoenas, not subpoenas issued by the executive branch, for entirely different interests and they trigger different concerns. These subpoenas need to be in aid of valid legislation, not as a prosecutor's subpoena to probe wrongdoing. And the second is I -- I -- to take both your question and -- and I think what Justice Ginsburg was going to get at, we do think the analogy to Clinton v. Jones is actually helpful.
The Court there rejected an absolute immunity but said the President was entitled to some special protection. And we are here saying the Court should take exactly the same approach.
We're not saying the House has no power to get at the records of a sitting President.
We're saying that it needs to satisfy a heightened standard because, if it doesn't, these requests will become routine, and that weapon in the standing arsenal of the Houses of Congress will, I think, be routinely deployed in a way that -- that harms both the separation of powers and that undermines the presidency. Justice Alito? Could you apply the standard that you think is appropriate to the subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee? Sure, Justice Alito.
So, there, the Intelligence Committee says that it's investigating foreign -- foreign influence in recent elections.
But the subpoena goes back to 2010.
It doesn't link any way -- in any way to foreign transactions.
And it targets only the President. I have no idea why one would serve a subpoena that broad, both in breadth and duration, if what one is concerned about is a far more specific topic that would apply, I would think, to federal candidates more generally and more narrowly to foreign transactions and to more recent transactions. And there is nothing in the red brief that explains the mismatch. On the other side, the Financial Services Committee says it's investigating money laundering after the 2008 financial crisis.
But its subpoena only goes back to the middle of 2016, and, again, it targets the President. None of this makes any sense if what you are doing is in aid of legislation. Justice Ginsburg referred to legislation concerning disclosure requirements that would apply to the President, and there's also mention of conflict-of-interest legislation that might apply to the President. Does Congress have the power to regulate the President in these ways? I think it's very unlikely on the conflict-of-interest side, Justice Alito, that even the D.C. Circuit did not rely on that because of the serious constitutional questions it would pose if you disabled the executive from managing some part of the executive branch. I think the financial disclosures are the hardest.
And I guess what I would say is, if the House in its brief had explained with any specificity what it might want to do to the Ethics in Government Act and why then it needs the President's documents, we could have that debate.
I think the room is probably narrow. But we're not -- the United States is not saying there's no room, but we don't even get there because all they say is we might want to amend the EGA, ""see, e.g., HR 1,"" which was a bill the House passed before it even issued these subpoenas. And so it's very hard to sort of shoot at a target in the dark.
I don't know what the House wants to do with any specificity, so it's hard to say whether that's valid legislation. Justice Sotomayor? Mr. Wall, that's the issue, isn't it? Which is, until Congress investigates, A, it doesn't have a chance to determine what might be valid, and, B, we don't have a chance then to look at an actual law and say it may or may not be valid.
You're asking a court in the guise of a heightened review standard to speculate as to legislation that's not in effect yet. But I want to go back to the subpoenas at issue and their breadth.
You note that the Intelligence Committee goes back 10 years.
But I think it's fairly common knowledge that Mr. Trump, before he was President, was thinking about running for President for a very long period of time. Why is it that Congress can't believe that looking at long-standing relationships and how those relationships changed or didn't change is important to knowing what undue influence might be occurring? Justice Sotomayor, if it wants to do that -- our submission is just a fairly modest one -- it needs to do more than wave its hands about general purposes and say that the President would be a useful case study for prospective and generally applicable laws. Mr. Wall -- Again, I'm not denying -- -- Mr. Wall, in what other setting does any investigative body have to do more than what was done here? I would point to the prosecutor in Nixon -- For private -- for private records? Well, this particular question hasn't come up to the Court before in a constitutional context, but, in Nixon, of course, the prosecutor had to show, demonstrate a specific need.
In the Senate Select Committee case -- I'd rather that you -- -- the congressional committee had to show -- Mr. Wall, please, I don't want you to go to executive privilege cases.
I want you to go to papers that, indisputably, have nothing to do with Mr. Trump while he was a private person.
They're not asking for these records post being President. They're asking for these records pre being President. I think that makes the problem worse, not better, Justice Sotomayor. They're targeting the personal life of the President before he was a candidate for office. That raises, granted, somewhat different but deeply troubling and equally problematic constitutional concerns that you will harass -- Justice Kagan? Justice Kagan? Mr. Wall, I'd like to go back to your use of Clinton v. Jones because I -- I had read that case differently.
Of course, Clinton says that you're supposed to treat the President's requests with respect when the President says, like, I -- I need a deposition scheduled at a different time or can we have written interrogatories rather than a deposition? But the fundamental claim of presidential immunity or -- or even presidential difference was rejected in that case. And I suppose what -- if -- what I'd like to know about your argument -- I read your brief and I read the President's brief -- own brief, and no place do you make a case as to why these particular subpoenas place a particular burden on the President such that he will be prevented from carrying out his constitutional responsibilities. And that's what I took Clinton v. Jones to be saying, is that's the kind of thing a President has to come in and show, a sort of case-specific argument about burden on the President.
And are you making that kind of argument at all? Well, yes and no.
Not if what you mean by ""burden"" is sort of compiling and delivering the documents to the House.
Yes if what you mean by ""burden"" is what I think Clinton v. Jones -- in the Clinton v. Jones sense, which is harassing and undermining the President. Now exactly these subpoenas, well, I mean, I think you have to look at it -- Well, harassing and undermining the President -- I mean, the point of some of those suits is presumably to harass and undermine the President, and the Court let them go, let -- you know, let them proceed.
And it said the only thing we're going to be concerned about is if you come in to us and say, in defending those suits, you're going to be prevented from performing the responsibilities that we, the nation, need you to perform.
Are you making an argument of that kind? Yes.
In the courts below, when the House was pressed on the limits of its theory, it said that probably it could not draw the blood of the President or read his teenage diary.
The power that they are seeking and the burden they will impose in the aggregate on the President will, I think, reshape and transform the balance of the separation of powers. So, yes, we are saying that these subpoenas, and, certainly, these subpoenas taken in the aggregate, once the House has this weapon, will harm and undermine the presidency of the United States, not just this President, the institution of the presidency going forward. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I believe in earlier discussions with Justice Alito, you indicated that Congress might be able to regulate in the area of financial disclosures of the President, and that is one of the interests the House has asserted here. What more would you require the House to do to assert that interest? What -- what would be enough, in your mind, to demonstrate the heightened need you suggest is needed? I don't think it has to go provision by provision, Justice Gorsuch, or anything like that.
But I do think it's got to describe the possible legislation with enough specificity to enable meaningful judicial review. So we know the President's required to disclose certain things from the Ethics in Government Act.
If the House had said -- Well, let me stop you -- let me stop you there.
Let me -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but let me stop you there. Let -- let's say the House says we're considering legislation on whether to require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns for a set number of years.
Would that be -- would that be sufficient and, if not, why not? I think that might be.
And then the need -- then you'd have to look at what they were going after from the various campaigns. It wouldn't get you anywhere near these subpoenas or targeting the President, of course, but at least in your hypothetical, they'd be identifying with some detail, some specificity, what they were thinking about doing.
And then we could have -- then it would tee up what I think is the hard constitutional question of what's the space for Congress in regulating a constitutionally created officer like the President with respect to disclosures. And that's, frankly, a hard question. That's the hardest of all the -- the possible legislation they pointed to.
I -- I just -- I -- I don't see how we can have that debate in this case because they haven't even enabled meaningful judicial review.
And that's a fact that I think should cut against the House, not against the President. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Wall.
I want to make sure we touch on one of your procedural arguments.
You say that the full House needs to authorize the subpoenas.
The other side, the House, argues that Resolution 507 did so. What's your response to that? The response, Justice Kavanaugh, is that 507, if you -- if you look at its terms, it's both a rubber stamp and a blank check.
It -- it purports to authorize anything and everything that ever has been done or will be done by the committees. It falls short then even of the fairly meager resolutions in Rumely and Watkins, which at least described general purposes, general legislative topics.
This gets back -- gets back to my colloquy with Justice Gorsuch.
And, here, we're talking about the President. So I know that three committee chairmen understood what they were doing.
I don't think 218 members of the House have understood that they understand the gravity of the constitutional question they're teeing up. And so the Court also requires a clear statement from Congress when the separation of powers is -- is at issue.
We'd say the same thing here.
That's the -- that's the cleanest and narrowest way to dispose of this case. Second question: History and practice matter quite a bit in separation of powers cases, as you know. Justice Ginsburg earlier cited precedent from Watergate and Whitewater, as did Justice Breyer. Can you respond -- and -- and those dealt with legislative subpoenas.
Can you respond to those points about those precedents? Yes.
So, for the first 200 years of the republic, there's nothing like this.
The House's examples either didn't involve the President -- What about -- sorry to interrupt -- but specifically Watergate and Whitewater. So that's what I was coming to.
I think the Watergate subpoenas were for official records, and, obviously, they were subject to a heightened needs standard. The Whitewater subpoena is the closest analogy.
It's modern.
It was never litigated. But I'll -- I'll -- I'll -- I'll grant that subpoena looks very much like this one. I don't think that there's any historical precedent for it.
And the concern, Justice Kavanaugh, again, if we go down this road and the -- the Houses of Congress can weaponize the subpoena power in this new way, that's going to sit in the standing arsenal for years against the President and any other constitutionally created officer. And I don't think it takes much imagination to know where that road will lead or that we will regret having taken it. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Letter. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to jump right in and address some of the -- the very key points that have been made by my friends here. Mr. Wall, my very good friend, Mr. Wall, said that the legislation here doesn't match up.
Mr. Wall referred the Court to the wrong pages of our brief. If you look at pages 17 through 36, you see that we discuss in great detail the purposes of the investigations and the subpoenas.
And, indeed, the D.C. Circuit said that, in telling terms, the -- the House has put legislation where its mouth is.
We have specifically provided bills. Mr. Wall said that the full House did not confront the subpoenas.
Page 241 of the appendix, I refer you to, where the -- the House specifically referred to these very subpoenas, these specific ones. And I don't think Mr. Wall really meant that the -- to say that the members -- 218 members of the House did not know what they were doing when they passed that.
That obviously is not a valid argument to be made. Then we turn to something that came out in answer to Justice Sotomayor's question. Remember, the key records here, some of the key ones that we want, are ones that President Trump has not even seen.
We want records from third-party business entities that bear analyses of -- of, for instance, requests for loans.
So the -- these are documents that there's no privacy interests in, no constitutional liberty interests, et cetera. Next, we do have limiting principles. The House very much does.
This Court's precedents set those.
It must be pertinent to a legislative purpose, can't violate constitutionally protected liberty interests or privileges, and can't undermine the President's ability to carry out his responsibilities. And -- Mr. -- Mr. Letter, the -- let's talk about the standard you propose.
The -- the -- the quotes in your -- your brief is that concern is subject on which legislation could be had. Could you give me a plausible example of a subject that you think is beyond any legislation that Congress could write? Your Honor, I think the best I can do is refer you to the Court's decision in Kilbourn, where the Court there said that Congress didn't seem to put forward any possible legislation there.
It had to do with bankruptcy proceedings that Congress was looking into. Well, you don't think it -- do you think bankruptcy proceedings is -- is a subject on which legislation could not be had? Oh, no, obviously, bankruptcy could be, and -- but in the Kilbourn case, this Court thought that no such reason had been put forward.
But -- but, no, Congress's legislative authority is extremely broad, especially because of its appropriations -- Well, that's what I'm suggesting, that your -- your -- your test is really not much of a test.
It's not a limitation.
And it doesn't seem in any way to take account of the fact they were talking about a coordinate branch of government, the executive branch. Do you have any alternative to that limitless test that would take account of -- of the fact that you're dealing with a coordinate branch of government? Yes, I do, Your Honor. And I'm -- by the way, the test that I'm referring you to was the test that this Court had set about pertinent to a legislative purpose.
But, Your Honor, it's -- it's what this Court said in Nixon versus GSA and a -- and a number of other cases. Congress -- there would be a limit if Congress is interfering with the President's ability to carry out his Article II functions. No such claim has been made here, nor, obviously, can it be made given -- Justice Thomas? Yes.
Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Letter, I'd like you to discuss the -- how the power, the legislative subpoena power, is implied or how we arrive at that power, because I think that's part of why we're wandering around in the wilderness trying to determine what standards we are to use. Your Honor, this -- this Court has explained in -- in quite a few cases -- I think Watkins, Barenblatt, others -- that the Congress's legislative power, which -- I mean investigative power, which stems from the British parliament's power, is an obvious and integral part of legislation. We obviously can't have Congress passing legislation in -- in ignorance.
And this Court has said, for instance, most recently in Franchise Tax Board, that just because a power is -- is something to be implied doesn't mean that it's not important. For instance, this Court's power of judicial review, that's nowhere mentioned in the Constitution.
So the -- the power to investigate -- Can you give an example, another example of a power that -- a legislative power that is implied? The -- the -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm not coming up with something right now off the -- the tip of my tongue. That's okay.
The -- can you give me the earliest example you have of Congress issuing a legislative subpoena? The -- the Congress investigated the -- the St. Clair expedition. It didn't actually issue a subpoena in that case but its equivalent of the time.
And President Washington consulted with his closest advisors and decided to provide Congress with every single thing that it requested. So that was just several years into the -- What's the first example of Congress issuing a legislative subpoena to a private party for private documents? The -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
The -- the Watkins decision has a lengthy discussion of that.
I don't have off the top of my head the very first one.
But my memory is that this Court describes that in great detail in Watkins. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? The -- the concern has been expressed that Congress could be using the subpoena power to harass a political rival. So what is your answer to -- what is the principle, the limiting principle, that would say legitimate legislative purpose, yes, looking toward enacting a law, but not to harass a President from the opposing party? Two answers, Your Honor. First is this Court's decision in McGrain, which is -- is extremely important here.
Now McGrain was not seeking papers of the President, but, there, the lower court struck down -- said the subpoena was no good, the congressional investigation was no good because it was inspired by politics.
This Court absolutely and flatly and unanimously rejected that as a reason that it couldn't be done. And then the other is Clinton versus Jones, where this Court said, if there is harassment, the courts can take care of that. And that's the answer to the Justice Department's entire brief.
There is no -- no responsible claim here that all that's going on is harassment.
And if there is, this Court has said we're here. Thank you. Justice Breyer? Thank you. In respect to the authorization, was there proper authorization by the full House of the legislative subpoenas, two points.
One, Rumely says look at the subpoena and its authorization as of the time the subpoena was issued, here, perhaps, the time that it was challenged first before the later authorization in the full House was passed. Two, compare it with the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon.
Look at the authorization.
The authorization there is highly detailed, highly specific, and it suggests they could go after the information held by any person, presumably, including the President. This authorization, which came after the challenge, in fact, writes a pretty blank check for anything, without detail. Now those are arguments made by the other side.
I'd like to hear what you say. Thank you, Justice Breyer.
Several responses, and I'll try to be quick. First, McGrain, this Court said very, very clearly, you don't just look at the authorization.
There was no authorization there. Second, yes, Section -- Resolution 507 is, in part, broadly worded, but it is extremely specific in its third ""whereas"" clause.
Right there on page 241, it refers to these very specific subpoenas. And, in addition, authorization is much -- is much different now in the modern Congress.
The modern Congress has authorized committee chairs to -- has authorized committees to issue subpoenas, and those committees then have, in general, delegated that authority to its chairs. So the modern Congress, there clearly is authorization to committee chairs to issue these subpoenas.
And as I said, if there's any doubt at all about that, the full House ratified these very specific subpoenas. Before or after Rumely? I mean, before or after they were issued and challenged? This is after they were issued and challenged.
The issuance, as I said, is authorized by House rules, which this Court has said it -- it will not examine, and then the full House -- because there were arguments made, the full House said: Oh, no, we authorize these exact subpoenas.
We ratify the -- the issuance of these subpoenas. It is extremely clearly worded, page 241a of the -- of the petition appendix. Thank you. Justice Alito? Mr. Letter, I was somewhat baffled by your answer to Justice Ginsburg about the use of congressional subpoenas for purposes of harassing a president. Your final answer was courts can take care of that.
But that's the issue here, whether something should be done to prevent the use of these subpoenas for the harassment of a president.
So could you explain what you meant? Absolutely, Justice Alito.
This Court in Clinton versus Jones and in other cases, like Nixon versus GSA, has said we are here to protect the President if there is harassment from Congress or private individuals. And, here, there -- there clearly, though, is, we think, valid legislative purposes.
The four courts below all found that there was. So, I mean, I -- I don't want to cut you off, but I have very limited time.
So your answer is that the protection against the use of a subpoena for harassment is simply the assessment whether the subpoena is conceivably -- is relevant to some conceivable legislative purpose? Correct.
That's what the Court has said.
But also again Clinton versus Jones and Nixon versus GSA, it -- Well, that's not much protection.
In fact, that's no protection, isn't it? It is protection, Your Honor, if what -- what Congress is doing is interfering with the President's ability to do his job.
These subpoenas are to private parties.
The President does not need to do anything. Well, when you talk about interfering with the President's ability to do his job, you mean this is going to take up too much of his time, or do you -- does that include the potential for the use of subpoenas solely for harassment and political purposes? Your Honor, if they were solely for harassment, then they wouldn't meet the standards of they have to be pertinent to a legislative purpose.
So I think the combination of all of those provides ample protection, but there's no -- But you were not able to give the Chief Justice even one example of a subpoena that would be -- that would not be pertinent to some conceivable legislative purpose, were you? As -- as I said, Your Honor, the -- that -- that's correct, because this Court itself has said Congress's power is -- to legislate is extremely broad, especially when you take into account appropriations. Well, so the end result is that there is no protection whatsoever in your view, and maybe this is -- this is the correct answer, but, in your view, there is really no protection against the use of congressional subpoenas for the purpose of preventing the harassment of a president because the only requirement is that the subpoena be relevant to a conceivable legislative purpose, and you can't think of a single example of a subpoena that wouldn't meet that test? No, Your Honor, because, remember, there may be constitutionally based privileges or things like executive privilege -- you know, executive privilege -- All right.
Well, there might be congress -- there might be constitutionally based privileges.
Which constitutionally based privileges apply to a subpoena for records in the hands of a third-party? There could be, Your Honor, issues -- What are they? Would you name one? Well, it seems to me executive privilege could enter in.
State secrets privilege could enter in depending upon the specific circumstances, Your Honor. Let me ask you one more thing if I -- if I can and there's time. Are there any limits on the use -- on using a president's records as a case study relating to the need for legislation? So, for example, if the salary and the net worth of a future president before election was that of a person who would be regarded as middle class, and Congress says, you know, we want to study possible revisions of tax laws and the provision of services to members of the middle class, so we're going to subpoena all available information about the assets, income, expenditures, and services obtained by this sitting President and his family for purposes of considering that legislation, would that be permissible? It -- it certainly could be, Your Honor.
So, here -- that's a very good question.
Here, remember, the Financial Services Committee is doing an extremely broad investigation of a financial services sector, and there's massive public reporting that President -- that before he became President, President Trump's personal records and his businesses and his family have been heavily involved in those very activities.
And we're investigating numerous other banks and individuals having nothing whatsoever to do with the President. This is part of a much larger sector-wide, industry-wide investigation.
And President Trump is the -- Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, we have said that personal records would -- with the aim of making the President a case study threaten to run afoul of this Court's teaching that there's no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure. And your -- the other side points to some hypotheticals that are troubling: the President's transcripts simply to pass on educational reform legislation or subpoenas of his personal medical records simply to enact general healthcare reforms. Tell me what we say to ensure against those hypotheticals and against a proposed subpoena that might be just for the sake of exposure. Your Honor, a couple of answers.
One is, yes, you said just for the sake of exposure is no good, but the -- the -- this Court said that exposure involving government activities can be. Pertinence would be the key, pertinence to a valid -- a legislative purpose. And, here, the Intelligence Committee, the -- there's an obvious need to focus on the President's financial records to determine if the President is subject to foreign leverage. It's -- it's obvious that that ties in with that legislative purpose.
So pertinence -- Let me put -- let me put -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we're limited in time. On that issue of what laws are possible, I can see the argument on conflicts of law, but aren't there already a lot of disclosure laws in place? How could this investigation help improve those or change those? I assume what Your Honor is referring to is disclosure laws, disclosure laws by the -- the President.
And so we -- we would have to look to see what -- exactly what the oversight committee was looking at. Do we need better laws about conflicts of interest? Do we need better laws about, for example, a president dealing in contracts with government agencies? The -- the -- the Congress could limit government agencies' ability to enter into or -- or keep contracts with elected public officials. In addition, Congress maybe would want to provide for more, you know, exposure of -- of assets and conflicts of interest.
Maybe those -- One last question: Was the breadth of these subpoenas litigated below? Yes, Your Honor, those -- The breadth? -- those -- yes, Your Honor, those exact claims were made and they are discussed in great detail by the Second Circuit and the D.C. Circuit.
So those were fully litigated below. Breadth or -- Justice Kagan? Good morning, Mr. Letter.
In -- in -- in talking to the Chief Justice about the limits on congressional power, you said -- and tell me if I'm quoting you correctly -- you said that a subpoena couldn't impair the President in carrying out his constitutional functions. Is that -- is that right? Your Honor, there would have to be a balance there. Okay.
But that's what we should be looking to.
And then you said no such claim has been made or could be made. And I also took the briefs not to be making that claim, that this subpoena would impair the President in carrying out his constitutional functions, but Mr. Wall told me that he was kind of making such a claim because he thought that this subpoena would undermine the President in -- in -- in his job. And I guess I -- I would like you to comment on that. Your Honor, it's fascinating because I wrote a note specifically on that.
That -- that argument was not made in the Justice Department's brief, to my knowledge, anywhere. My friend, Mr. Wall, mentioned it here.
But there's no way that this could interfere with the President because he doesn't have to do anything.
This is a subpoena to -- to banks and an accounting firm.
And as I said before, in fact, some of the key documents we want the President probably has never even seen or doesn't even know that they exist.
We want to know banks' analyses of his -- his request for a loan, internal bank analyses. But, yes, Your Honor, that argument was not made in the briefs. Okay.
And if I could get you to talk about the history that some of your colleagues have talked about. What do you think the history shows us with respect to this issue? Your Honor, very briefly, what it shows is -- is -- ties in with a key principle of law that this Court has said of constitutional interpretation.
History can help inform what the Constitution means. There's a lengthy history of presidents either voluntarily or not voluntarily complying with requests for information by Congress.
And we went through -- it's -- it's, you know, Presidents Washington, Jackson, Buchanan, Grant, and in more modern times, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, and Clinton, all complying with in various ways either voluntarily or not. For instance, in the Nixon case, Nixon voluntarily provided certain tax returns.
He didn't provide all of them.
Congress then got more pursuant to statutory authority, like a subpoena, from President Nixon and his family's tax returns.
I don't think that either the Justice Department or Mr. Trump answered that hypothetical. History really matters here, and it shows that the arguments being made here by President Trump are -- astonishingly ask you to ignore a massive amount of history. Thank you. Justice Gorsuch? Good morning, Mr. Letter.
Normally, we use law enforcement investigative tools like subpoenas to investigate known crimes and not to pursue individuals' defined crimes.
That's a principle you're well familiar with from your time at the Department of Justice. And I'm wondering what limiting principle you offer us here that can prevent that danger.
The first one was it has to be pertinent to a legislative purpose, but I think, as we've explored, that's very, very broad and -- and maybe limitless, some would suggest on the other side at least. Constitutional privileges, if you're investigating someone in their private capacity, there are going to be few, maybe attorney-client privilege, things like that. And it can't be burdensome, I heard, was your third, but in an age where everything's online and can be handed over on a disk or a thumb drive, that -- that -- that much pretty much disappears too. So what -- what -- what is left to protect that important value that I know you share? I do share that, Your Honor.
And, by the way, burden here -- none of the subpoena recipients have claimed burden. Your Honor, I -- I answer it this way because, again, it has to be -- I'm going to stick with the pertinent to legislative purpose because, for example, Congress did a massive investigation of what happened at 9/11. Obviously, a lot of that had -- Well, let me -- let me stop -- let me stop you there if that's where you're going to go.
And I thought that might be, Mr. Letter, and I apologize for interrupting. But I would think a federal prosecutor might say that an investigation of an individual could be pertinent to a criminal investigative purpose too because there are so many federal crimes out there and it's possible this person jaywalked or failed to pay his taxes or whatever the -- whatever his concern is, that that's a legitimate investigatory purpose for sure. So what -- what -- what -- what -- what takes us out of that -- that realm and that concern? Your Honor, I think this will largely depend on the courts.
The only thing I can suggest that takes it out of that concern is, as we know, Congress can't prosecute, but, as we know, it clearly can look into criminal activity in order to figure out whether the criminal laws should be changed. The -- the most obvious example would be this Court's decision just a -- a -- a little while ago overturning a -- a key criminal conviction involving white-collar crime. Obviously, Congress could do a very thorough investigation of that to determine whether to pass a different criminal law statute that would actually make it a crime to -- to do what was done in -- in Bridgegate. So it's going to be very difficult to separate the two and say that what Congress is doing in looking into criminal activity for the purposes of determining if the FBI is doing a good job and needs more money or whether to amend the criminal statute, it's -- it's -- there's going to be an extremely rare case where that is going to be invalid on Congress's part. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Letter.
I want to follow up on the line of questioning that several of my colleagues have pursued, the Chief Justice, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Alito, Justice Kagan, and others, which I think come down to the idea of limitless authority and how to deal with that. The other side says that allowing these subpoenas and subpoenas like these, say, for medical records, would be a grave threat to future presidencies.
It would be open season, they say, on private records of anyone who is President and maybe other government officials too.
And they worry about the harassing nature of subpoenas like that. You say -- and Justice Gorsuch was just exploring this -- it's okay so long as it's pertinent to a legislative purpose.
But I think everyone has explore -- explored with you that just about everything can be characterized, in terms of a subpoena, as pertinent to a legislative purpose.
I don't think you could answer the Chief Justice's question about something that wasn't. And the question then boils down to, how can we both protect the House's interest in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency? How can the Court balance those interests? I guess the thing I would say is why not employ the demonstrably critical standard or something like that -- this is what the other side would say -- as something that's borrowed from a different context but that might serve to balance the strong competing concerns here? Your Honor, that's a very good question.
I have -- I have several responses. The first one goes to the last thing you said about why not employ a demonstrably critical test.
I -- I don't know how the Court would -- the courts would do that without violating the separation of powers. I was reminded recently by -- by the congressional leaders that often, they're doing investigations, they don't know where the legislation might go at that point.
So I don't know how you would force Congress to do -- to show some sort of demonstrably critical reason -- Well, wouldn't it be the -- wouldn't it be the same way that it's shown in an investigation where executive privilege is asserted and the demonstrably critical standard in that context has been the tried and true method for about 50 years? Because then, Your Honor, you could look at -- you could demand that the executive branch show that its reason for -- for seeking something over -- outweighs the executive privilege claim. But, here, remember, we're not dealing with executive privilege at all.
These -- these are financial business records.
It's -- it's difficult to see how these could ever come within that kind of -- of balance that -- that would override Congress's authority to do investigation. The one other thing I can suggest, obviously, is -- this Court has suggested, I believe, is -- is the voters, but also Nixon versus Fitzgerald, where this Court said that the President has absolute immunity from certain kinds of claims.
The Court said specifically that -- that one of the reasons that's okay is because we have congressional oversight of the President.
This Court specifically used that to justify absolute immunity for the President in other areas. And last is Clinton versus Jones. This Court -- Can I interrupt right there? What about medical records? Your Honor, medical records of the President would, I think, almost always be not pertinent to valid legislative purpose.
On the other hand, if you look at -- Why not? Can you just -- -- the Twenty-Fifth amendment, they would -- they certainly would be pertinent. Why wouldn't they be pertinent to, say, ethics legislation, healthcare legislation or the like in your view? Your Honor, I'm having difficulty thinking of a -- of a hypothetical where, if -- if Congress is -- is examining and deciding on amendments to the Affordable Care Act, how the President's personal medical records would be relevant to that. It -- if -- as I say, the -- the most important public health statute of many, many decades I don't think would be affected by that at -- at all. Okay.
Thank you. So I'm sure we can come up with some odd hypotheticals where presidential health would clearly be relevant, maybe changing the -- the statutes that involve the succession of when a president becomes incapacitated, something like that, I -- I suppose. But, in general, Congress -- there would be no valid reason for Congress to be asking for the President's personal medical records that I can think of. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Letter, I know you will be delighted to learn that we have time for additional questioning, so I think I'll begin with myself, and then we'll go through in order and just see how far we get. One thing that hasn't come up is the fact that we're dealing here with three separate committees, and we're concerned, as you've recognized, with the potential for harassment. And how does that play in? I mean, at what point does the number of committees investigating the -- the President's personal papers become a factor in an analysis of the issue of harassment? Your Honor, I am very pleased there's more time for questions. But, Your Honor, it -- it would seem to me that there are situations, again, you'd have to look to, you know, Clinton versus Jones, when does it reach a particular stage? We're nowhere near that here. And, in fact, the -- the subpoena by the Intelligence Committee matches the subpoena from the Financial Services Committee to Deutsche Bank because, specifically, Intelligence did not want to cause too much of a burden to subpoena the -- What about -- what about -- as -- as you know, very shortly, in the second case, we're going to talk about subpoenas from district attorneys.
How does that factor in? I mean, should those be counted in the balance in terms of when congressional subpoenas become harassment? Definitely not, Your Honor, since we -- we have nothing to do with such -- the subpoena in Vance.
We don't -- we have no -- we had no contact with the -- the -- the City of New York before that subpoena was issued.
And so I don't know how that would tell us about anything about what the House of Representatives -- What about -- what about the Senate? I suppose they can issue subpoenas too, can't they? Of course, Your Honor. Yes. So how do you balance that? You've got, in this case, three different House committees seeking subpoenas. You've got the district attorney in New York. You know, depending upon party composition of different bodies in the future, you might have the Senate joining in.
How do you measure harassment in a case like that? Your Honor, I think what you would do is, if these were subpoenas from the House and the Senate, a massive number of them, going to the -- the White House, then there certainly would be at a certain point where it would affect the ability of the White House and the President to function.
There's no doubt about that. But these subpoenas are to three private businesses involving -- Thank you. Justice Thomas, any further questioning? Yes.
I'd like to follow up on that, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Letter, the -- that's -- you know, at some point, there's a straw that breaks the camel's back, and it seems as though you're saying that we should look at these in isolation as opposed to in aggregate -- in the aggregate. Why wouldn't we look at all of them and look at the -- the full effect and whether at some point it debilitates the President? Your Honor, I'm sorry, I -- I must have misspoken.
I meant to answer the Chief Justice's question by saying, yes, if there are a massive number of subpoenas from the House and the Senate to the White House, and -- and the White House can come in and say: Look, we -- we can't do anything.
All we're doing is answering subpoenas all day long.
This is -- is impacting the ability of the President to do his job. Why would it be limited to the House and the Senate? I mean, it could be every grand jury.
It could be every prosecutor.
The concern that we had in the Clinton case is, at some point, this thing -- it gets out of control, as one -- one could be manageable, but 100 could be impossible. And Your -- Your Honor is right.
And, therefore, if there were -- if our subpoenas were on top of numerous others from grand juries around the United States, you could look at that.
But let me emphasize one more time, our subpoenas are -- the three are not to the President.
They are to private business entities.
Nothing is required of the President here to -- for these subpoenas to be fully complied with.
Not a single thing is required of the President or the White House. Justice Ginsburg, any further -- Well, I think we all know it's about the President. Justice Ginsburg, any further questioning? No, I'll pass. Justice Breyer? Yes, you emphasized it goes to a private person and it's for tax returns.
But the subpoenas that I've seen go far beyond that.
They apply to 15 Trump-affiliated entities.
They ask for all documents related to opening of accounts, due diligence, closing, requests for information by other parties, et cetera. Now that's a lot of information, and some of it's pretty vague.
And if somebody subpoenaed you for that information or subpoenaed your tax accountant or subpoenaed somebody in your business, wouldn't you at least want to know what was being turned over? Wouldn't you want to ask them? And might that not take time? And might that not take effort? So my problem is there may be burdens here, third-party or not, and not just political burdens.
The job of the House and Senate, in part, as the President, is politics.
That doesn't bother me. But the Clinton v. Jones information does bother me.
And the fact that what I hold today will also apply to a future Senator McCarthy asking a future Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman exactly the same questions, that bothers me. So what do I do? Justice Breyer, I fully understand that concern.
None of the subpoena recipients have complained about burden.
The reason these subpoenas go back a ways is because, as you know -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.
I'm not talking about their burden.
I'm talking about the President's burden in having to monitor, decide if there are privileges, figure out what his answers are to all those documents you are requesting which go, in my opinion, way, way, way beyond just tax returns. Two -- two answers, Your Honor.
Yes, we're -- we're -- tax returns, we're going far beyond tax returns, but no privilege claim has been made in this case.
No party, nobody, has raised a privilege claim. Second is we're investigating, for instance, among other things, money laundering. Money laundering requires looking at a whole range of financial activity.
What we're doing here is exactly the kind of thing that Senate and House staff do when they're looking at a financial sector and what kinds of reforms should be made to the banking industry. Let me say one more time: There has been no claim of privilege here.
There has been no claim that there is a burden.
No claim whatsoever.
So those may be relevant in different cases, but certainly not this one. Justice Alito? If one House of Congress were to subpoena personal records in the hands of a third-party regarding a member of the other House, let's say someone in a leadership position in the other House, do you think that the doctrine of separation of powers would impose any limitation on that subpoena? Very interesting question.
Your Honor, the -- the first thing that comes to mind, though, is wouldn't that violate the speech or debate clause.
Remember, no member of either the House or Senate can be questioned anywhere else. And so, if there's a -- a request for records, if it's tied in in any way to the legislative functions of that -- of that Senator or House member, that would be invalid. Well, let's say they're similar to the subpoenas here.
So they don't have anything to do with the performance of the legislative function.
They are records regarding the personal activities of this individual, purely personal activities.
And we can even say that they concern things that were done before the person was elected to Congress. Still -- and does part -- part of your hypothetical include that they would, nevertheless, be pertinent to a -- a legislative purpose? Well, pertinent to a legislative purpose. Then -- The committee wants to use someone in a leadership position in the other House as a case study for possible legislation. Then, if it met then your hypothetical, I -- I think that -- that would be a valid subpoena.
I'm not aware that it has ever happened in the history of the House or Senate.
I'm -- I'm not -- I don't know of anything that would be like that -- Justice -- Justice Sotomayor, anything further? Yes.
That's the whole point, though, isn't it? Justice Alito is raising this hypothetical because he says shouldn't then we look at history.
And it's only modern history where committees have asked for personal papers.
So he presumably would discount that.
And he would say shouldn't we respect the separation of powers, that what's personal to the President is similarly personal to a Congressperson? Justice Sotomayor, I -- I have to -- to disagree strongly with one thing you said, a key part.
No, the history -- we -- we have history of seeking, Congress seeking personal papers of Jackson, Buchanan, Grant, et cetera.
No, there -- there's been lots of seeking of personal papers by Congress for many, many decades.
This is not just a modern practice at all. So how do we get -- Justice Kagan? Mr. Letter, I'm wondering if I could ask you to comment on a potential difference between, on the one hand, the Oversight and Intelligence Committee subpoenas and, on the other hand, the Financial Services subpoena. The -- the first two subpoenas address the President directly, you know, the financial disclosures that the President makes, conflicts of interest, foreign involvement in Presidential campaigns, but the Banking Committee, Financial Services Committee, you know, was taking a much broader scope. And -- and when the -- when -- when that's true, when the Congress doesn't seem to be looking into the President but in a much broader topic, might there not be some heightened need for Congress to say why it is that they're focusing on Presidential records for that purpose? Your Honor, I think that still would get into -- would raise major separation of powers problems.
As a court would have hearing, the court would ask chairmans of various committees to come and testify as to what they were doing and why. You're certainly right in your description.
This is -- there are 11 subpoenas issued by financial services to members of, you know, banks, et cetera.
And -- and only two of them have to do -- I mean three subpoenas, two entities, have to do with the President.
This is a much, much broader investigation. And last is there's massive public reporting about the -- the -- the subjects of these subpoenas and their banking practices, and Deutsche Bank and Capital One have both been sanctioned many millions of dollars by banking regulators for failing to properly comply with money laundering laws. Justice Gorsuch, anything further? No, Chief.
Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Yes.
Thank you, Chief Justice. And, Mr. Letter, I want to follow up on Justice Alito's question, and this really goes to the fact, I think, that there's concern about what the limiting principle is here, I think, pertinent to a legislative purpose is almost no limiting principle at all, at least I think that's what some of the questions have explored, and his hypothetical about a committee would start subpoenaing members of Congress of the other House or of the other party, and you said, well, that hasn't happened. But isn't the whole point that once you start down this road and this Court articulates too low a standard, that something like that will start happening? That's the concern that I heard identified or that I took away from that hypothetical. So I want to give you a chance to respond to that hypothetical of why it wouldn't spiral. I -- I greatly appreciate that chance, Justice Kavanaugh.
Two -- two responses. First, remember exactly what this Court did in Clinton versus Jones.
And -- and, you know, I was on one of the losing briefs there.
But this Court said we're going to let this happen because -- and then -- but we will -- the courts will monitor the situation and -- and if there are abuses, the courts are still here. In addition, you know, Justice Alito's hypothetical, I also realize it -- it might be there getting into things like privileged information or information involving constitutional liberty interests.
And that's -- this Court has struck down criminal convictions, et cetera, for subpoenas that -- that do involve -- Well, if it was personal records exactly identical to the personal records here but for members of Congress, none of those would apply, presumably, at least under what you've articulated so far today. I -- I think that's right.
But, again, this -- I -- I come back to Clinton versus Jones.
You -- you -- this Court issued a very clear decision saying we're going to allow this one, but, obviously, the courts are going to monitor this. So, if, contrary to what has happened in the past over our -- our lengthy history, if there are situations when there -- the President's ability to do his job is being undermined, thank goodness the courts still exist and they are there to take care of it. Mr. Letter, would you like to take a minute to wrap up? Your Honor, I -- I greatly appreciate that. The -- I'm sorry.
Just flipping back to my notes.
I apologize. As -- as I was saying before, remember that some of the key records here are ones that the -- the President has never seen and never had anything to do with. And the -- we ask the Court to focus on the specific subpoenas in this case because we're not dealing with ""what if's"" here.
We're not dealing with situations where -- like a lot of the Justice Department argument focuses on. As I said before, fortunately, this Court exists to fix those kinds of situations should they arise. Thank you, Mr. Letter. Mr. Strawbridge, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. You know, my friend from the other side struggled with every hypothetical that he was given about his ability to set some sort of limiting principle or some category of information or documents about the President that would not be obtainable under his theory. And I think that's very telling because there are no limits to their theories. And, in particular, let's just consider the example that was given regarding medical records.
There is no reason under his theory why the President and his family and his grandchildren could not be declared useful case studies and, therefore, Congress could send out a subpoena for their medical records. For that matter, the President eats and drinks like everybody else and Congress naturally has the ability to regulate food safety. But that does not mean that Congress can subpoena medical records or even the President's DNA.
My friend refused to even rule out that hypothetical categorically below, and I think it's telling that -- that he can't provide any meaningful limit today. And I think that's consonant with the fact that they failed to consider what their actual legislative need is.
This is an implied power in aid of legislation.
It's not a free-ranging warrant to investigate wrongdoing going back 10 years. They -- he cites to a laundry list of legislative proposals, almost all of which were passed before these subpoenas even issued.
And at no point in the argument section of their brief or today does he try to tie any particular legislative proposal specifically to the President's finances, let alone the vast swath of documents that they seek here. This is not an attempt to preserve the separation of powers.
It's an attempt to eviscerate that. On that point, I wanted to note, in response to Justice Breyer's question, which I may have misunderstood, the Senate Watergate committee, in fact, did serve congressional subpoenas under the legislative power and, applying the heightened need standard, the D.C. Circuit invalidated it, just as this Court invalidated the attempt to hold in contempt somebody in Kilbourn when it violated the separation of powers, just as the lower courts every time separation of powers has squarely been presented have invalidated it. These subpoenas are overreaching. They are an obvious distraction.
They are going to multiply if this Court accepts the path that the House is attempting to lay.
The decisions below should be reversed.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-635, Donald Trump versus Cyrus Vance. Mr. Sekulow. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No county district attorney in our nation's history has issued criminal process against a sitting President of the United States, and for good reason.
The Constitution does not allow it. Temporary presidential immunity is constitutionally required by Article II, and, accordingly, the Supremacy Clause defeats any authority the DA has under state law as to the President.
The Second Circuit is wrong and should be reversed. If not reversed, the decision weaponizes 2300 local DAs.
An overwhelming number of them are elected to office and are thereby accountable to their local constituencies.
The decision would allow any DA to harass, distract, and interfere with the sitting President.
It subjects the President to local prejudice that can influence prosecutorial decisions and to state grand juries, who can then be utilized to issue compulsory criminal process in the form of subpoenas targeting the President. This is not mere speculation.
It is precisely what has taken place in this case and with the subpoena we challenge.
In the argument just concluded, we asserted that the subpoenas did not serve a legitimate legislative purpose and they were burdensome.
Yet, the DA copied almost verbatim the House Oversight Committee's subpoena, with an additional 13 words, which seek the President's tax returns. How revealing.
The exact same language utilized by two congressional committees would subsequently be copied by the New York County district attorney covering the exact same documents and sent to the exact same recipients yet purportedly for two completely different reasons. Under Article II or the heightened scrutiny standard under Nixon, the subpoena we challenge today cannot survive.
As the Second Circuit concluded and the DA represents, the President's being investigated for potential criminal violations in a state grand jury proceeding with a local DA issuing coercive criminal process against the President.
This, he cannot do. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, for all that, you don't argue that the grand jury cannot investigate the President, do you? We did not seek to have an injunction, as was the case involving Vice President Agnew, in enjoining the grand jury. We have targeted the utilization of the temporary immunity here to the subpoena.
That's correct. Well, in other words, it's okay for the grand jury to investigate, except it can't use the traditional and most effective device that grand juries have typically used, which is the subpoena. It can't use a subpoena targeting the President.
And under his Article II responsibilities and the Supremacy Clause, that, is our view, would be inappropriate and unconstitutional. So we have not challenged the -- I don't understand -- I don't understand -- your theory in terms of distraction and all that would seem to go much farther than resisting the subpoena. I don't know why you don't resist the investigation in its entirety or why your theory wouldn't lead to that. Well, our -- our position is that criminal process against the President -- and that's what we're talking about, that's what's before the Court -- criminal process targeting the President is a violation of the Constitution. We did not seek to enforce an injunction or seek an injunction against the grand jury investigating the situation with the President.
It was targeted -- You focused -- you focused on -- Yes. -- you focused on the distraction to the President, but -- Yes. -- I don't know why -- in -- in Clinton versus Jones, we were not persuaded that the distraction in that case meant that discovery could not proceed. And, you know, there are different things that distract different people, but I would have thought the discovery in a case like Clinton versus Jones, even though civil, would be distracting as you argue the grand jury proceedings are here. Well, Clinton versus Jones, of course, was in federal court.
This is in state court. Clinton versus Jones was a civil case. This is a criminal case.
And as this Court noted on page 691 of its opinion, if, in fact, the Clinton versus Jones case had originated in a state court proceeding, it would raise different issues than separation of powers, concerns over local prejudice, and in Footnote 13, this Court said that any direct control by a state court over the President may implicate concerns that are different than either branch disputes under separation of powers.
So it would be a -- Justice Thomas? Yes, counsel, just a couple of questions.
I'm interested in whether or not you can point us to some express language at the founding or during the ratification process that provides for this immunity. Well, there -- there's a couple.
There was a colloquy between Vice President -- well, ultimately, Vice President Adams and Senator Ellsworth where they talked about process against the President and they took the position that any process against the President would be constitutionally problematic. Thomas Jefferson, of course, wrote in the letters he had regarding subpoenas that were issued in the Burr trial that allowing local magistrates to banter about a sitting President from north to south and east to west would interfere with the President's responsibilities. And as this Court just -- in the previous argument just stated, the burdensome nature of this is categorical.
It's not -- you can't just look at the one subpoena.
It is the potential for 2300 DAs, or just 1 percent of them, 23 DAs, issuing process against a president. But the concern over interference from our founding with the President's responsibilities was discussed, and that's why in the Constitution there's process to deal with it. Does it make a difference when a subpoena goes to a third-party? Certainly not here. Number one, they've -- the Respondents have either forfeited or waived it.
They have conceded in their brief that they -- they are seeking the President's documents.
These are the President's documents.
He is the real party in interest, and he has the burden, including review with his counsel, over any existing privileges and what these documents might entail. Thank you. Thank you, Justice Thomas. Justice Ginsburg? We have said in the grand jury context that the public has a right to every man's evidence.
Is it your position that that is, save for the President, every man's evidence, save for persons protected by privilege, and there is no privilege involved here, these are non-privileged, non-confidential papers, so is the -- the grand jury right to every man's evidence, exclusive of the President, every man except the President? That's one question. And then I wanted you to answer specifically, Paula Jones held that the President was not immune from civil suits for conduct occurring before he took office.
If Paula Jones had sued in state court rather than federal court, would Clinton have had absolute immunity? Well, this -- to the second question first, if I might, Justice Ginsburg, this Court in Clinton against Jones said that if the case was brought in state court it would raise different issues of concerns over local prejudice.
It was different than the separation of powers issues at play.
It was issues involving the Article II and the Supremacy Clause.
So the Court said that on pages 691 and Footnote 13. With regard to everyone -- every man's evidence, this Court has long recognized that the President is not to be treated as an ordinary citizen.
He has responsibilities.
He is himself a branch of government.
He is the only individual that is a branch of government in our federal system. So, too, our position is that the Constitution itself, both in structure and text, supports the position that the President would be temporarily immune from this activity from a state proceeding while he is the President of the United States. Justice Breyer? Every -- every man's evidence excludes the President? If I may, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Ginsburg, it's not that it excludes every -- the President.
The President is not to be treated as an ordinary citizen. And this is a temporary immunity.
This is for while the President's in office.
And we think that is required -- Justice -- -- by the Constitution. Thank you. Justice Breyer? Well, you make a point of the 2300 district attorneys.
But, of course, in Clinton v. Jones, there might be a million, I don't know, tens of thousands of people who might bring lawsuits.
Perhaps all of them were unfounded, but they could file the paper. Well -- Why isn't it sufficient just to apply ordinary standards? I gather ordinarily any person who gets a subpoena can come in and say it's unduly burdensome.
And what counts as unduly burdensome for a doctor who's in the middle of an operation might be very different from a person who's a salesman, and similarly for the President.
All the factors you raise could come in under the title unduly burdensome. So why not just go back, let the President say, I'll show you precisely how this is burdensome.
I'm going to spend time, effort, working all these things out, figuring out what they mean, et cetera.
And if he shows undue burden and lack of connection, he wins, and otherwise not.
That's true of every person. That's Clinton v. Jones.
Why not the same here? Justice Breyer, the hypothetical you just gave, I think, proves the point.
By the time you were to prepare, review, analyze the various requests just in these two -- three cases that we have today shows the burdensome nature. And then to require the President of the United States, who, as you raised in your opinion, in a concurring opinion in Clinton versus Jones, that burden is being met just by us being here. But to require the President to have to respond to each and every state district attorney that would like to -- No, he would hire you and he'd hire a lawyer to list what the burdens are.
That wouldn't take a lot of time.
And then he wouldn't be burdened because you'd go in and say what the burdens are.
And if you're right, you win that case.
They're saying, the other side, there are no burdens here. Well, I would point the Court -- You say there are. I -- So send it back and let them figure out what they are. I think doing that establishes the problem with an analysis, a case-by-case analysis. For instance, in this very case in this subpoena found on page 118a and 19 of the Petition Appendix, there's a list of documents that are extensive. You would have to meet with the President of the United States -- I mean, could you imagine just for a moment, Justice Breyer, that I -- and you said he -- let's assume the President were to hire me -- that I'm going to call the President of the United States today and say, I know you're handling a pandemic right now for the United States, but I need to spend a couple, two to three hours with you going over a subpoena of documents that are wanted by, here, the New York County District Attorney.
I know you're busy -- Thank you, counsel. -- but you -- can you carve me out two hours. Justice -- Justice -- Justice Alito? Aren't there at least some circumstances in which the U.S. Constitution would permit a local prosecutor to subpoena records containing information about a sitting president? So think of this situation. Suppose that the prosecutor has good reason to believe that the records contain information that is not available from any other source about whether a third-party committed a crime, and suppose that waiting until the end of the President's term would make the prosecution of that crime impossible or at least very difficult. Would you say that at least in that circumstance it would be permissible for the grand jury subpoena to be enforced? In a -- in a state court proceeding, the -- the issues of time and burden are still there. Now, in U.S. v. Nixon, that was a case where the President was a witness and the documents were asked for and this Court said should be handed over.
But, in that case, it was very clear that the President was a witness, and the attorney, the independent counsel there, Leon Jaworski, specifically stated to this Court that the President was not a target. So, if we had a pure witness standpoint, while it's a different case, the same constitutional principles would be at play, but, here, we're talking about criminal process targeting a president. Well, was the answer that that would be permissible if the prosecutor were willing to say that the President was not a target, whatever that means? Well, it wouldn't mean that it's constitutionally permissible; it would raise different issues for the President to consider.
But, constitutionally, I think that we have to be -- I have to be very clear here. Constitutionally, under Article II and the Supremacy Clause, as to a state court proceeding here, we think even as a witness it raises serious issues.
Obviously, a very different case than this, but serious issues nonetheless. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, it seems that you're asking for a broadness of -- of immunity that Justice Thomas pointed out is nowhere in the Constitution. And, in fact, the Constitution protects against presidential interference with state criminal proceedings.
It doesn't allow the President to pardon offenders for state prosecutions, for state criminal convictions. And yet I -- I find it odd that you want us to rule that there's essentially an absolute immunity from investigative powers, the height of a state's subpoena -- police powers, and that we would permit a civil damages case by a private litigant, which we did in Clinton. Prosecutors have ethical obligations with respect to grand jury investigations.
They have to keep those investigations secret.
They can be prosecuted if they leak that information. Don't we usually presume that state courts and state prosecutors act as they should and in good faith? Even if you were to assume that -- And doesn't -- if you let me finish. Yes, please. And doesn't the President always have the opportunity to show that a particular subpoena, in fact, was issued in bad faith? The President was given that opportunity here.
And a affidavit, I understand, was filed under seal setting forth the reasonable grounds for the investigation. I -- I -- I'm not sure why he's entitled to more immunity for private acts than he should be for public acts. Well, he's the President of the United States.
He is a branch of the federal government.
He's the -- We only give -- we only give judicial officers and congressional officers immunity for acts within their official capacity.
If they don't, if judges sexually harass someone, we've said that's not within judicial functions, they can be sued.
If congressmen do the same thing, they can be sued. So my question still comes, you're asking for a broader immunity than anyone else gets. Well, we're asking for a temporary -- You have time for -- you have time for a brief answer, counsel. I will.
We're asking for temporary presidential immunity.
I would point out that under New York state law, witnesses before a grand jury are not sworn to secrecy.
They can state that they testified and what the nature of their testimony was.
I'd also like to point out that there are hundreds of members of the United States Congress and 100 members of the United State -- States Senate, there is one President. Thank you. Justice Kagan? So, Mr. Sekulow, you've said that a number of times and made the point, which we have made, that presidents can't be treated just like an ordinary citizen.
But it's also true and, indeed, a fundamental precept of our constitutional order the President isn't above the law. You know, from our first days, Chief Justice Marshall told Thomas Jefferson that he could be subpoenaed, he could be examined as a witness, he could be required to produce papers. And so I guess going back to Justice Breyer's question, why isn't the way to deal with these two things, that the President is special but that the President is like an ordinary citizen in that he's subject to law, is to say the President can make these usual objections that a subpoena recipient can make about harassment or about burden, and the courts in reviewing those, of course, should take seriously the President's objections and treat those with a certain kind of sensitivity and respect due to somebody who is a branch of government. Why isn't that the right way to do it? For two reasons.
First, and I think the case here is the perfect example, here, the district attorney copied verbatim the House Oversight Committee and Ways and Means Committee subpoena verbatim.
So -- and we were just discussing in the previous case the nature of that burden. For counsel, the President hiring counsel for each time he could be subpoenaed as a witness or, in this particular case, as a target, would raise a serious impact on the President's Article II functions.
So we think a categorical approach -- and it's very specific here -- state process as to the President -- targeting the President's documents in a criminal proceeding should be prohibited. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I -- I'd like to return to the question of Clinton versus Jones and how you would have us distinguish it. Yes, it took place in federal court, but it was a civil case, and as has been pointed out, others -- there could have been multiple versions of that in multiple different districts across the country. So what's -- what's different about that? How do we avoid the conclusion there that the President wasn't subject to some special immunity but here is? I think -- I think the nature of the case that we're dealing with here is not in a vacuum itself.
There are other cases that the President is dealing with at the same time. So what may have been a situation for President Clinton with a lawsuit, we have multiple litigation going on, including with the New York attorney general.
So I think the Supremacy Clause issue and the Article II issue here is pronounced, as this Court alluded to in Clinton against Jones, for that very reason, this idea that local prejudice would impact the President. So the idea that we would wait until there's more of these, we're already here on four subpoenas or three subpoenas, three cases involving multiple subpoenas, much of which covers the same documentation.
So I think it -- it, in fact, Justice Gorsuch, proves the point. We're here because the House has asked for documents that now the district attorney is asking for.
So we are seeing that in real time -- How -- -- the burdensome nature of what's happening here. -- how is -- how is this more burdensome, though, than what took place in Clinton versus Jones? I -- I guess I'm -- I'm not sure I understand that. Well, I mean, there's a big distinction between a defendant in a civil case and a principal in a criminal case, here by the state district -- or the local DA. Let me stop you there. Yes. Yes, there -- there -- there, they sought the deposition of the President while he was serving.
Here, they're seeking records from third-parties. But they're his records from third-parties, Justice Gorsuch.
The third-party is simply the agent custodian of the President's tax returns, on the President's statement of financial conditions.
So these are the President's documents that they're asking. And what's to stop them from seeking a deposition of the President or, for that matter, asking the President to appear before a grand jury? Because, if the official versus unofficial was the deciding factor, and our view is that the initiation of process here interferes with the President's official duty, but, if there was going to be this unofficial/ official distinction put in place, well, then what stops the -- the local district attorney from having the President testify, having the President -- President tried? Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Sekulow. Good afternoon. Just following up on Justice Gorsuch, just explain, if you can, the rationale for having one rule for criminal and another rule for civil.
Just assume there's one criminal investigation.
That's it. Well -- And just explain the rationale for a different rule there. Well, it's not that it's a different rule because, in this case, because it's within the context of a state proceeding, you have Article II concerns and the Supremacy Clause issues, as this Court alluded to in Clinton against Jones, that create the issues of concern about local prejudice.
But the -- the criminal nature of it creates a burden very distinct from a civil case, to be clear. Someone that is targeted -- Why -- why is that? Well, the idea that you are the subject or a target of a criminal case being brought against you is very different than a civil suit, where, at the end of the day, it results in monetary damages, not -- not a loss of liberty. So there's a big distinction between a civil case and a criminal case in that regard. And I think that impacts the -- the standard upon which this Court should be looking at the President's temporary presidential immunity. We're talking about stopping a process targeting the President, this subpoena targeting the President.
That's what we're talking about here.
It is that burden that is our concern. I think the other side says that the position you're articulating is a bit more consistent with Justice Breyer's concurrence in Clinton versus Jones than with the majority opinion.
And in his concurrence, he said that judges hearing a private civil damages action against a sitting president may not issue orders that could significantly distract a president from his official duties. It's pointed out that that language was not in the majority opinion. What do you think about how we should assess that -- Well, I think that civil discovery -- -- that part of Clinton versus Jones? -- versus criminal process is -- are two very distinct processes. And in a -- in a civil context, in a civil proceeding, there's a -- we have the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the federal court that govern how that process goes forward, and federal judges can take into various considerations, especially dealing with the President. This is a state proceeding initiated by the local district attorney against a sitting President of the United States.
So the -- our concern here is the nature of the proceeding itself is why we view categorically that a subpoena targeting the President and his records here -- How do you deal -- -- would be violated -- Sorry to interrupt. No, please, How do you deal with statute of limitations issues? Well, statute of limitations issues, of course, are decided under New York state law, and under New York state law, there would be procedures that could be utilized if, in fact, the DA were to elect to -- to start a process like that or if there were to eventually be action. But I -- I need to say something. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Yes, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General Francisco. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At a minimum, a local prosecutor should have to show he really needs the President's personal records to subpoena them for two reasons. First, as the Court suggested in Clinton against Jones, state proceedings can pose a greater threat to the presidency.
The 2300 prosecutors across the country necessarily place more emphasis on local interests than national ones.
A special needs standard ensures that federal courts balance the prosecutor's local need for information against national interests, including the President's need to do his job. Second, ordinary grand jury rules are not designed to protect Article II interests. That's why, in Nixon, the Court held a federal prosecutor had to show a demonstrated specific need for the information sought.
A local prosecutor should at least be required to meet the same standard. As the Court has repeatedly said, in no case of this kind would a court be required to proceed against the President as against an ordinary citizen.
And, here, the district attorney hasn't tried to meet the special needs standard. General Francisco, we -- we just heard Mr. Sekulow argue in favor of an absolute standard, no circumstances, no how.
Your position is that, as you say, at a minimum, the special needs test must be met. Of course, Mr. Sekulow is representing Mr. Trump.
You're representing the United States.
You're arguing for a more flexible standard.
So what was wrong with Mr. Trump's position? Your Honor, I actually think that Mr. Sekulow makes a very strong argument on the immunity issue.
We just don't think it's one that the Court needs to address, at least until the prosecutor argues and attempts to meet the special needs standard. Here, since the prosecutor hasn't argued and isn't arguing before this Court that he meets the special needs standard, there's no reason for the Court to address the broader immunity question, and -- and -- and it's the Court's ordinary processes to try to avoid those broader and more difficult questions when possible, and, here, we think that the special needs standard would fully resolve this case at this stage of the proceedings. Well, in a -- in a typical case, with adequate allegations to say that the standard's implicated, you would say that it goes before a court and the court will examine whether or not the criteria you -- you talk about, which I gather is the test under Nixon, are met, and, under Mr. Sekulow's standard, the -- would not immediately go before the court.
He was looking for a ruling from us saying that he's absolutely immune, so the Court would have no business addressing such a case. That's a very significant difference. Well, Your Honor, I think that in both instances the argument would be available to an article -- you -- you would be able to make that argument to an Article II federal court.
Under our argument, if the court found that the prosecutor hadn't met the Nixon special needs standard, it wouldn't need to address the broader immunity question. If it did find that the special -- that the district attorney met the special needs standard, it would have to then address the broader immunity question.
And all we are saying is that, unless and until the special need issue is addressed at the threshold, there's no need to address the broader immunity question in this case. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes.
General Francisco, the -- you mentioned the level of threat to the President or burden on the President.
How do we determine that, when it's too much? Well, Your Honor, here, I think there are a couple of things that you can take into account. First, the fact that we're in state court, I think, is quite significant.
Local prosecutors are necessarily going to put more emphasis on local interests than national ones. It simply reflects the manner in which they rise to office through elections by local, relatively homogenous political communities. And in New York State, I would also add that the trial court judges are elected in a similar way. So, there, you've already got this risk of local prejudice.
And so what the special needs standard does is -- is that it ensures that there's a federal court that's available to balance the local interests against the national ones, including the President's need to do his job. And then, secondly, it also has to do with the ordinary grand jury rules that would apply to a local prosecutor exercising his authority.
Those rules were not designed to and they're not sufficient to protect Article II interests since, under ordinary grand jury rules, a district attorney never has to make a particularized showing of need. Instead, the burden is on the witness to show that the subpoena can have no conceivable relevance to any plausible subject of an investigation. Now that is a perfectly appropriate standard in the ordinary case, but the reason why Nixon applied the special needs standard above and beyond the ordinary rules of criminal procedure was because the Court recognized that the President is the sole person in whom all Article II powers are vested. And so he is entitled to a measure of protection above and beyond the ordinary rules. And the special needs standard is one of those measures of protection. To put -- point back to Justice Breyer's very persuasive concurrence in Clinton against Jones, I think Justice Breyer correctly predicted that this Court would need to develop special protective procedures precisely for the President in the context of litigation like this. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? You stress that the states are subordinate sovereigns, so -- and so they are subject to the Supremacy Clause, but you don't give any credit at all to the Tenth Amendment and the reserve powers of the state. That's one question that I have. And the -- as far as the impact of the President is concerned, I think there's no case more dramatic than the Nixon tapes' devastating impact on the President.
He resigned from office.
But yet that was okay. So I really don't get it. So, Your Honor -- Yes. So, Your Honor, in -- in terms of the Tenth Amendment, all we're saying is that Article II vests all executive power in a single President of the United States.
He is the sole person in whom all executive power is vested. And so that necessarily implies that there are limits on what others can do to unduly burden him in his ability to do his job.
So all that the special needs standard does is ensure that a prosecutor really needs the President's information before he can enforce that subpoena, since, if he can't even show that he really needs the information, he's necessarily imposing an undue burden on the President and creating a serious risk of harassment. And if you multiply that by 2300 prosecutors across the country, I think that the risk to the presidency is quite obvious. In terms of the Nixon case, we are actually arguing for the same standard that the Court applied in the Nixon case, the special needs standard.
We're just saying that a local prosecutor in state court should at a minimum be required to meet the same standard that the federal prosecutor in Nixon had to meet and show that he really does need the information that he's seeking, since, again, if he doesn't, it's unnecessarily burdensome -- May I -- Yes, Your Honor. The grand jury is an investigatory body.
It doesn't make at the outset specific charging decisions while the investigation is under way.
It investigates in order to determine should there be specific charging decisions, but you would have them make charging decisions before they investigate, and that seems to be backward. Your Honor, respectfully, no.
I would simply urge that you apply the same standard that Judge Wald applied in the In Re Sealed Case, which was a grand jury subpoena issued to the White House, where she concluded, properly in our view, that Nixon's special needs standard ought to apply to grand jury subpoenas. It's not -- you don't have to make a charging decision, but you do have to show a demonstrated specific particularized need for the information pursuant to which you are issuing the -- the grand jury subpoena. Justice Breyer? Yes, thank you. General, I -- I think that the Nixon tape case has one thing for you, one thing against you.
The thing against you, I think it was a case where executive privilege was asserted. But what's for you and I think might be more relevant is -- is, in that case, the Court said, well, there has been first a weighing of the burdensome nature, et cetera -- a lot of other things in that -- in the lower courts that have decided that it is appropriate to go forward. Now what I don't see is why you need a special standard more than that here, the ordinary standard.
You would need -- Your Honor -- -- you would need a decision by us that it's reviewable in federal court.
I understand that.
But I don't see why you have to go beyond that where the things you're talking about would be taken into account. Your Honor, you are absolutely correct that, at a minimum, we would need federal court review.
And in that regard, I would note that the district attorney here agrees that there are Article II limits on what he can do and that those Article II limits are in federal court. But, respectfully, I would suggest that Nixon stands for more than simply some kind of weighing of interests.
Nixon applied the special needs standard and it said that the prosecutor did, in fact, have to show a particularized need for the information.
That's all that we are suggesting ought to apply here. Well, wasn't that in the context of the assertion of executive privilege? Excuse me, Your Honor? Wasn't that in the context of an assertion by the President of executive privilege? Yes, Your Honor, it was, but litigation about private conduct is also burdensome.
And as the Court recognized in Clinton against Jones, the President might well need more protection in state court than he gets in federal court precisely because of the risk of local prejudice.
And that's why the Court reserved judgment on that question. So I think, when you put those two things together, it does make it entirely appropriate to hold a local prosecutor in state court to the same standard as the federal prosecutor was held to in the Nixon case. And, indeed, even if you were to take the district attorney's own case-specific test, I think you would need the special needs standard.
After all, we don't typically get discovery into a grand jury proceeding. So the only way to assess at the front end whether the prosecutor is issuing an unduly burdensome subpoena or issuing a subpoena in bad faith is to require some kind of showing of special need. After all, why would a local -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito? General, could you explain in more specific terms how you think this showing of special need would be carried out in district court? I assume that the prosecutor would have to make some kind of -- would have to reveal what was being investigated and why this particular information was needed for or essential for the investigation. Now would that be done -- would that be reviewed by the judge ex parte? Would it be available to whoever the sitting President is to object to that, to review it and object to it? Your Honor, it's difficult to answer that question in a vacuum because I think it would very much depend on the particular case, but let me make my best stab at it. I think that in order to have meaningful judicial review, you would need -- the prosecutor would need to make public as much as could responsibly be made public so that the President would have an opportunity and the President's lawyers would have an opportunity to make their case on the particular facts. If there is a certain amount of evidence that really cannot responsibly be made public, then I think it would be appropriate to consider ex parte proceedings or filings under seal. In all events, we think that that's the type of assessment that needs to be made when you're talking about subpoenas, unprecedented subpoenas like this one, that are from state and local prosecutors targeting the President of the United States. The other place I would point you to is, again, Judge Wall's -- Wald's very good opinion for the D.C. Circuit in the In Re Sealed Case, where she does walk through in some amount of detail and unpack how the special needs standard applies to grand jury subpoenas. How essential must the information be in order to meet this special needs standard? Does it have to be absolutely indispensable, not available from any other source by any conceivable means, or simply very useful? Your Honor, it's probably somewhere in between those two things. I think it's got to be -- I think it's got to be critical to the charging decision, so it can't just be marginally useful or, you know, merely duplicative or -- or interesting to a tangential side issue.
It does have to be critical to the charging decision. If the information is readily available elsewhere, I don't see how a prosecutor could meet the special needs standard.
And if the information he has -- he currently does have is sufficient for him to make a responsible charging decision, I also don't think he -- how he could meet the special needs standard.
So I think I would put it somewhere in between. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? General, there's always danger in taking a doctrine adopted for one set of needs, and that has to do with needs that are balancing what is clearly recognized in law as executive privilege versus the needs for the proceeding at issue, and transplanting it to a situation that's totally different, where we're not talking about a claim of executive privilege, and we're not talking of executive immunity; we're talking about private activities that predated the President's tenure. So why are we using all that transplanted language, and why don't we get to a standard that takes care of what you're worried about, which is harassment and interference, and simply ask whether the investigation is based on credible suspicion of criminal activity and whether the subpoena is reasonably calculated to advance that investigation, a standard that looks to whether there is a good-faith basis for the state prosecutor's actions and whether the subpoena is reasonable in its scope and burdens? I don't understand why that sort of standard is inadequate, especially for a proceeding that involves secrecy, like a grand jury subpoena. For two reasons, Your Honor.
First, for the reasons that I think Justice Breyer did persuasively explain in Clinton against Jones, even litigation about private conduct can be quite burdensome, and that is particularly so when you're talking about private conduct that's being litigated in state court pursuant to state procedures.
So I think that's why he correct -- correctly predicted that this Court would need in future cases to develop special protective procedures precisely in this context. And, secondly, I think that the special protective procedure that we are proposing here is necessary even under Your Honor's general approach.
After all, why would a prosecutor take the unprecedented step of issuing a subpoena to the President of the United States for personal records from a local prosecutor if he can't even show that he really needs the information that he's seeking? If he can't make that showing, I think there is a pretty good reason to be a little bit suspicious.
After all, very few prosecutors -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? So, General, a couple of times now, in response to Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor, you've explained why we should use the standard from executive privilege cases by saying, well, litigation about private conduct is also burdensome. But the point about executive privilege cases is not that it's burdensome.
I mean, the critical factor is to weigh the interests that a president has in communicating with advisors on official matters, often about national security, often about military matters, and -- and -- and the need for confidentiality in that, and that's why the Nixon standard was developed, not because of generalized ideas about burdensomeness, which can be dealt with in other ways. So, again, why should that standard be used here? Respectfully, Your Honor, because I think that there are parallel interests.
Executive -- executive privilege, you are right, is meant to protect the confidentiality of communications, but Article II, more generally, is meant to protect the President from being unduly burdened in his ability to carry out his responsibilities. And so -- and I think that's particularly necessary when you're talking about state court proceedings by the many, many, 2300 local prosecutors across the country, who, again, are more responsive to local political constituencies and local interests than national ones.
So I think that -- But, again, General -- -- when you look at Article II -- -- you don't need the -- the -- this heightened standard in order to take account of burdensomeness.
Burdensomeness is something that can be addressed in any subpoena, and I'm sure that courts, when it gets to the President and the special responsibilities of the President, will address those interests with respect, with sensitivity, especially if we tell them so. So why would you need this heightened standard that is meant to protect confidential communications about official government business? For two reasons, Your Honor.
First, because, under the ordinary grand jury rules, the only question as to burdensomeness is whether the subpoena has any conceivable relevance to any plausible subject of investigation and, therefore, is unduly burdensome. And, secondly, I think that judgment has to be made by federal courts, not state courts, because state courts, like local prosecutors, are going to be more responsive to local interests.
After all, in New York State, trial court judges, like the district attorneys, are elected in partisan elections. So all we're saying is that this is the type of assessment that needs to be made in federal court, and the most appropriate and easy-to-apply standard is the standard that you've already been applying for 50 years under the Nixon case. And we think that that is an -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I -- I'd like to just explore a little further how this standard would -- that you're proposing would play out in practice. I -- I suppose you'd have a local prosecutor saying, I'm investigating a tax infraction, and the best and maybe only evidence of -- of -- of that potential infraction are the tax records in the possession of the -- of the potential defendant. Why wouldn't that meet the special heightened test that you've proposed in every case? And if that -- if that -- if it does, then what -- what have we achieved? Well, Your Honor, I think it would depend on who the potential defendant is.
If the potential defendant is the President of the United States, here, the district attorney doesn't contest the fact that he cannot indict the President of the United States until after he leaves office.
So he wouldn't be able to show that he needs the information now in order to indict the President of the United States. Of course, if the potential defendant is somebody else, then it might start looking closer to the Nixon case itself, where the special counsel was investigating a third-party. And I think that would, in fact, be a relevant consideration under the special needs standard. I -- I guess I didn't follow that last portion of it.
Let's say the infraction is by a corporation or some entity and we need the -- the prosecutor's going to say we need these materials in order to determine whether there is an infraction. Right. Why wouldn't that qualify under your standard? I think that would certainly be a relevant thing to take into account under our standard.
And if he actually met the special needs test with respect to the information and found that it was really necessary in order to bring charges against that third-party, he may well meet the special needs standard.
And then you'd have to address the broader immunity questions. How much -- In this particular -- -- how much showing of special need is required under your -- under your standard? A prosecutor says, I have some -- some reasonable suspicion that there's a tax deficiency by some entity.
Is that enough, or would more be required? Your Honor, I think it -- I think it's more than that.
I think he's got to show that the information he's seeking is critical to him responsibly making a charging decision, that he can't get that information from somewhere else, and the information that he does have is insufficient. It's essentially the same standard the Court applied, this Court applied in Nixon, the D.C. Circuit applied in the In Re Sealed Case. You know, it's not like it's a hard and fast bright-line rule, but it is an administrable rule that courts have been applying for some 50 years now. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good afternoon, General Francisco. Good afternoon, Your Honor. I want to follow -- I want to follow up on Justice Thomas and Justice Kagan and really zero in on what the Article II interest is before we talk about what standard. And I think, in Justice Breyer's concurrence in Clinton against Jones, he referred to the interest in time and energy distraction, which he drew from Nixon versus Fitzgerald, a different Nixon case, as an independent Article II interest that is distinct from distortion of official decision-making, which would be more the executive privilege kind of interest. Is that the Article II interest you're zeroing in on, or is it something else? Well, Your Honor, respectfully, I think it's both of them.
And as I read Justice Breyer's opinion, he likewise understood it to be both of them. The whole idea is that Article II vests all executive power in a single person. And that necessarily means that others can't unnecessary hobble or debilitate that person in his ability to responsibly carry out his duties. So the whole point of the special needs standard is to ensure that others, including prosecutors, can't unnecessarily impede the President in carrying out his responsibilities. So, at a minimum, they have to show that they really need the information that they're seeking, since, if you have 2300 prosecutors that are unnecessarily hitting the President with subpoenas and none of them can actually show they really need that information, you're necessarily going to be undermining the President's ability to effectively carry out the Article II duties that the Constitution entrusts to him and to him alone on behalf of the entire country. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dunne. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two principles at issue in this case.
One is the central role of the President in the functioning of our national government and the need to avoid interfering with the President's ability to carry out those important duties. The other principle is that under our Constitution, when a President acts as a private individual, he or she has responsibilities like every other citizen, including compliance with legal process. In particular, this Court has long held that American presidents are not above having to provide evidence in response to a law enforcement inquiry. We're mindful that as a state actor, our office cannot investigate a president for any official acts and that we cannot prosecute a president while in office. But, here, we're talking about a subpoena sent to a third-party concerning private conduct by a variety of individuals and businesses.
Yes, one of them is the President, but no one's been targeted or charged with anything.
There's no claim of any official acts or any executive privilege. As the courts below found, the subpoena imposes no Article II burden whatsoever and was not born of any political animus or intent to harass.
Instead, it was fronted by public reports that certain business transactions in our jurisdiction were possibly illegal.
Given those allegations, our office would have been remiss not to follow up. In response, the President asked the Court to overturn 200 years of precedent by declaring he has a blanket immunity while in office from any legal inquiry, even for his prior private acts, even though that could result in a permanent immunity for him and the other parties if the statutes of limitation expire, and even though it could prevent the discovery of evidence that could exonerate the individuals involved. Finally, his novel claim also asks the Court to presume that state actors have a ""reckless mania"" that will cause them to ""relentlessly harass presidents and that state and federal courts will allow prosecutors to do so."" Of course, there's no historical support for this claim, which flies in the face of federalism.
The supposed floodgates have been open for generations and there's never been a flood.
The only thing new here is the subpoena comes from the state.
But absent a constitutional burden, that shouldn't leave the Court to abandon its long-standing respect for state criminal proceedings. Thank you, counsel. You know, we've had the cases this morning and this case and they are in many respects very similar in -- on -- in the case of the subpoena itself, they're identical, but I think in other respects they're really quite different. The separation of powers case this morning involved entities in an ongoing relationship, the House and the President.
And issues of this sort, although always very important, come up with some regularity. There's often disputes between the White House and Congress over documents, and almost always they're -- they're worked out because each of those branches have authorities and powers that affect each other. You know, if the Senate asks for documents from the White House and the White House doesn't give them, then the Senate says, well, we're going to, you know, take our time confirming your nominees and -- and back and forth. But, with respect to local prosecutors, you don't have that ongoing relationship.
So the possibility of working something out is -- is far less evident, and, if you're doing that, the -- the stakes are -- well, it's just a little more difficult because there isn't that ongoing relationship. So shouldn't there be a higher standard before we permit the district attorneys from around the country -- there are also more of them than the two Houses of Congress, 2300 of them -- shouldn't there be a higher standard than in the case of the separation of powers dispute? Your Honor, I think our answer to that is yes.
And putting aside its relationship or not to the separation of powers analysis, I'd like to address the -- the DOJ's proposed heightened showing standard because we -- we see that -- let me put it this way. We see that there are three reasons, I think, why the DOJ's new heightened showing proposal doesn't work.
And a number of questions in the last argument, I think, touched on some of these concepts, if I might. First, one problem is that the -- the approach that they're suggesting really reverses the Court's prior approach to fact-finding in these types of cases in a way that I think would harm the grand jury process, which I can explain. So, again, we agree there -- there should be a heightened showing requirement, but my point is only after a president has already established an actual Article II burden. Otherwise, there's nothing for a court to weigh in the balancing of Article II interests against the need for legal process, which -- and that balancing and that sequencing, frankly, was both -- central in both the Nixon and Clinton cases. Here -- Would you articulate for me precisely what standard you think should apply in your case and in what sense is it more rigorous than that would apply in the dispute between the White House and Congress? Yes.
I -- I -- I think we believe that a prosecutor, if there's been an -- an affirmative showing by -- by a president of an Article II burden, and, of course, the courts have below held that there has not been such a showing here, but if in a different case there was such a showing made, we believe a prosecutor should be required to show, one, an objective basis for the investigation and, two, a reasonable probability the request would yield relevant information. We think language like that would be more consistent with past cases of this Court and with the realities of a grand jury investigation. And, frankly, the courts below also already found that we've met that standard here. The -- the problem is that the alternative of requiring a state prosecutor to get permission first from a federal judge for any request relating to a president's business activities would undermine this Court's prior rulings, like the one in R Enterprises that a grand jury shouldn't be burdened by procedural challenges and delays because it's a confidential process and not an adversarial proceeding.
And the DOJ's new standard just ignores that. The other problem -- Justice -- Justice Thomas? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Dunne, you were about to say how DOJ's approach would harm the grand jury process.
Would you finish that? Yes.
And I think I was just addressing that, Justice Thomas.
That is, you know, to require us in any given case to run to -- across the street to federal court and say, by the way, we have an investigation underway, it happens to touch on a president's prior business transactions in which he and others were involved in, and we'd like to get permission to send a subpoena for records that are in either the possession of a president or maybe the president's agents, like his accounting firm here, again, it completely upends the way that a grand jury process is supposed to work. If I might, the second big problem I think with the DOJ's analysis is that the language that they've chosen just doesn't work, contrary to why as to what I just set out, because it only applies in the context of a trial subpoena. It calls for a ""stringent showing"" that the request is ""directly relevant to central issues at trial and charging decisions."" Again, that language just doesn't apply in the context of a grand jury when no charging decisions have been made. So that's why the -- the formulation that we've suggested, I think, would be more consistent with what's needed in a grand jury context.
But, again, we think that is utterly unnecessary here to apply in our case because, A, there's already been a finding of no Article II burden, and, B, we have already met the standard by the -- by the district court's finding that our -- our investigation is well-founded and brought in good faith. So I don't think this -- So what -- what limits a grand jury process in -- in New York? What are the limits? Well, the limits are, I think, the same basically as they are in federal court and most other states, Your Honor.
I mean, yes, a -- the recipient of a subpoena who has a basis to argue either a privilege or a burden of some sort has the right, as the President did here, to go into court and make those factual arguments that it's -- that's -- that either it should be quashed or -- or constrained in some fashion.
It is -- there is -- there's a grand jury judge who supervises all grand juries and their activities, who's always available here. But I think the more important point perhaps, Your Honor, is that, obviously, given the decision of the court of appeals below in this case, and to address that concern in that footnote in -- in -- in -- in Clinton, at this point, it's clear that a president, in particular, who has a concern about this kind of impact on Article II duties now always has the ability to go into federal court and not into state court, which was the main concern in that footnote in Clinton. What if you thought it was -- the President said it was impossible for him to do his job, as opposed to just being burdened? Would that -- would we have a role to limit or somehow end the grand jury process? Absolutely, Your Honor.
I mean, I think that's -- that's the point of the case-specific analysis, is -- is that it gives a -- a court, and here a federal court, to hear a concern like that expressed, and if the concern is -- you know, if somehow this shuts my office down or is -- is a real burden, it's not just a speculative mental distraction claim, then, yes, the courts are empowered to impose a wide variety of limitations, including, if necessary, to shut an investigation down or to shut a subpoena or a litigation down. That's the beauty of this Court's prior decisions in Nixon and Clinton and others, which have decided consistently to apply the case-specific analysis and -- and -- and have rejected the notion that this is best treated with a categorical prophylactic rule. I just think that that's not appropriate here when it's all so case-specific. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? The principal objections that have been raised is that when you're dealing with federal prosecutions, it's all controlled by the attorney general.
But, here, you have 2300 district attorneys, each armed with grand jury subpoena power.
So the control exists in -- in federal courts with the attorney general at the helm and no one controlling all of the state district attorneys. I understand, Your Honor, and I think really what that gets centrally to is the consistent argument here about the parade of horribles, if you will.
And if I could address that, I think there's several answers to that concern. First of all, there's really no empirical basis in -- in history for this -- this apocalyptic prediction.
The same claim was made and rejected by this Court in Nixon and then in Clinton.
That, of course, was decades ago, and there's not been a flood of subpoenas or litigations or prosecutions of -- of presidents by -- by states or federal prosecutors. Second, as a practical matter, you know, this notion that there are 2300 prosecutors out there writing with their subpoena pads open, there's just no basis to think that an army of local prosecutors like that would even have jurisdiction over a president, especially for private conduct, in the first place. Here, New York City, of course, has a particular connection to the Trump Organization and its financial transactions because it's headquartered here.
It's not likely that -- that more than one or many states, much less two -- 2300 counties, would ever have that kind of connection to a president's private conduct. Third, I -- I think, as -- as -- as, Justice Ginsburg, you mentioned in the last argument, this view that people -- that the -- there's a reckless mania by local prosecutors contradicts this Court's long-standing presumption in favor of regularity and deference to state proceedings. And so, to finish off, the limitation, I think, that you're asking about really comes in the -- in the form of the case-specific showing that past cases from this Court have established, because, if there is a concern about the behavior of a local prosecutor, any president, when necessary, but it's been few and far between over the decades, can run now not just into state court, which Clinton thought could be problematic, but can run into federal court and raise exactly the kind of claim that the President has raised here.
That's the limitation. Thank you. Justice Breyer? Well, thank you. What -- what -- I agree with you that the two basic principles you said at the outcome are there: every man's evidence versus the constitutional statement that the President is the executive, Article II.
And they conflict, just as in the first place -- the first case, the power of Congress, Article I and Article II conflict.
All right. Your Honor, I -- I think that I would say they don't conflict, but, yes, they're in tension in our view. They're in tension. Fine.
All right.
Now a possible solution is to say no absolute rule but just send it to the ordinary system for weighing the needs versus the burdens, and the different sides have to say what they are, and then have that reviewable in federal court.
And because of the nature of it, and we could list in an opinion the kinds of things that might not be or might be relevant, depending on the case.
And eventually, with the President, we might review it. All right.
Now all that would take time.
The time itself would discourage prosecutors from doing this, which might be good.
And time itself would encourage House, Congress, President to work things out in a non-judicial way.
All right? I don't put that as being wedded to it.
I want to know your reaction. Well, Your Honor, I think what you're describing is exactly what this Court held in -- in Clinton, and it's exactly, frankly, what has happened now in this case, which is, yes, in this case, the -- the President decided to pursue his -- his claim of immunity in federal court versus state court, which is fine and now available, I think, in the future to all presidents. But I think the -- the fact that that is, you know, what happened -- should happen in the ordinary course and which can happen in the ordinary course is, again, the solution and the limiting principle here, because it does -- it'll make it clear that there is a remedy and discourages, I would have thought, bad-faith impulses by any state or local prosecutor who might harbor such an impulse and provides an outlet that makes sure that it -- it can't get out of control. But, again, that's the beauty of the case-specific analysis.
I don't think these things lend themselves to categorical prophylactic rules.
And that's been the approach from this Court from day one. Thank you. Justice Alito? As I understand your proposed standard, there would be available review in federal court, and the prosecutor would have to show an objective basis for the subpoena and the relevance of the subpoena to the investigation.
Is that correct? Basically, Your Honor, language like that.
I -- I said point two was a reasonable probability that will yield relevant information, but, yes, that's the concept. Okay, reasonable probability.
What would be your objection to a somewhat more demanding standard? So the prosecutor would have to show that the information can't be obtained from another source or would be very -- it would be very difficult to obtain it from another source, and the information that -- unless the information is obtained right now, as opposed to at the end of the President's term, there would be some serious prejudice to the investigation. Your Honor, I, frankly, don't think that any of those concepts are foreign to the standard that I -- I articulated. And I think they are relevant, in fact, to the objective basis and -- and relevance points. You know, here, for example, and -- and -- and, again, I think the court -- the court below, the district court in particular, you know, heard our explanations, and including the fact that, you know, the reason why we went to Mazars is not to do an end run around negotiations with the President's lawyers. It's because Mazars, as the outside accounting firm, is -- is, as far as we could tell, the only repository of what might be the most important documents in an investigation like this, which are not just the tax returns but the surrounding accounting materials and work papers, et cetera, which shed light on the good faith or not of the transaction. So my short answer, I'm sorry, is that I think those -- those concepts are -- are -- are -- would be fine and not unduly burdensome in the -- in the context of the standard that I set forth. Can I ask you one other thing? Do you think that the adjudication of this in all cases of a similar nature would depend in any way on state law and practice regarding grand jury secrecy? In federal court, the rules of grand jury secrecy are, of course, very strict. States have different rules.
Suppose a particular state imposes no restriction on the revelation by a member of the grand jury or perhaps even by the prosecutor of the information that is supplied in compliance with a subpoena. Well, Your Honor, I'm not aware of any other states having that kind of lax or nonexistent grand jury secrecy rule.
I can assure the Court that in New York State our grand jury secrecy laws are at least as strict as under the federal system. But putting that aside, if, in fact, the -- the fact pattern presents to a judge the prospect that the information, in fact, will become public and the President were -- were to persuade a judge that the -- that publication of the documents at issue would themselves impose some sort of Article II burden or other -- other interference with his executive duties in that given state, you know, I suppose that would be part of the case-specific analysis that the court could -- could understand and take into account in deciding whether that there should be some limitation or -- or even a quashing of the subpoena itself. I think that's part of the case-specific analysis. I mean, we both know that prosecutors have different -- that -- that there are prosecutors who leak all sorts of information, including grand jury information, to all sorts of media sources, including specifically The -- The New York Times. If -- if there were a showing that that was a risk, would that have a bearing on this? Your Honor, it's hard for me to -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not aware of any kind of real pattern or practice of leaking of actual grand jury materials that are covered by grand jury secrecy. Yes, in all -- all different kinds of offices there are at times, you know, leaks of status of cases and that kind of thing, but I -- I am not aware, and -- and -- and our grand jury secrecy rules really prevent prosecutors, I believe, from, you know, actually turning over confidential grand jury secrecy materials to -- You're not aware -- you're not aware of this ever happening? Your office is never requested by media in the New York City area to disclose confidential investigative information? No.
Well, they ask all the time, Your Honor, and the answer is consistently no, at least as far as I can represent. But what I'm trying to draw a distinction between is people commenting to reporters all the time off the record, that kind of thing, versus turning over actual materials, like, you know, the voluminous tax returns or other sensitive documents that have been gathered and which are covered by grand jury secrecy.
That's -- that's what I just don't see happening here.
And I think history supports that view. Justice Sotomayor? When you are making an Article II burden, does that include the burden of harassment, the burden of using subpoenas for political purposes? Yes, Your Honor, I would certainly include that there.
And, again, there's been an express finding below here that there is a -- the investigation was well founded and that there was no harassment or bad faith in our bringing of these -- of the subpoena. Thank you. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, did I understand your answer to Justice Alito to be that you are in agreement with the SG that we should impose a heightened need standard, a special need standard? No, Your Honor, I was -- I was -- I think we're all now calling it the heightened showing standard or, in the DOJ's lexicon now, the heightened need standard, but I think what I'm articulating is a very different standard in terms of the actual language to be looked at and -- and imposed. Again, I think that -- Wait.
If you can, counsel, because I want to be very precise, if your standard includes what the heightened need standard has, then why not call it what it is, heightened need? There has to be a reason you think we shouldn't call it that, and you -- I don't know that I understand what difference you're proposing. I'm -- I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.
The -- the -- the concern I have with the DOJ language is, again, calling for a stringent showing that a subpoena request is directly relevant to central issues at trial and other concepts like that. What I'm trying to propose is something I think which is not so strict and which is not limited to charging and trial-related concepts but which would be workable in the context of a grand jury subpoena. And, again, whatever the standard is that we're articulating, I -- I want to stress that I believe that we are -- our office has met that standard here, even under the DOJ's proposal, because of the findings by the district court. All right.
Tell me why the heightened standard would interfere with the grand jury process. Well, I think, Your Honor, among other things, the -- the DOJ's proposed application of its standard, if you read its brief, would confer the same absolute immunity the President is seeking here.
What they say is, since you can't indict while in office, you don't need the documents while he's in office. And, frankly, that's an outcome that would apply in every case.
No subpoena could pass that test because they basically say, you know, you have to wait until he's out of office before gathering information be -- be -- because you don't need it in the meantime. And so their definition of heightened need says you don't need it while he's in office.
Well, that's not workable here. Why not? Because -- well, obviously, Your Honor, if we were to wait until a President was out of office in a situation like this, first, it would risk the loss of evidence, the fading of memories, and unavailability of witnesses, which is exactly what the DOJ Moss memo, of course, specifically contemplated that a President could be subject to a grand jury while in office to avoid losing that kind of evidence. Secondly and equally important here, no one should forget that we've got an investigation that -- that is, you know, looking at the conduct of other people and businesses. And waiting like that would benefit those other participants.
They could all end up above the law if the limitations period expires. So delay here is the same as absolute immunity and absolute permanent immunity for the President and others if -- if a statute of limitations expires.
That's -- that's the -- that's the problem with a delay. Well, but the other side says the statute would be tolled against the President.
But you're right, it wouldn't be tolled against other people who may or may not have committed crimes that he may or may not be a part of, correct? Correct.
And -- and that's important, Your Honor, for the third-parties.
But just -- just to address the -- my friend on the other side's comment about the tolling, I'm not aware in -- in state law of any doctrine of -- of implied tolling that would apply here to -- to protect the state's interests in -- in investigating and potentially prosecuting, if necessary, down the road. I don't know where that concept comes from.
But it's never been articulated by this Court.
There's no act of Congress which permits that kind of tolling here.
And so, for us, the statute of limitations is a big concern. We've -- we've -- frankly, we've already lost nine months of time in this investigation due to this lawsuit.
And, again, you know, this -- to -- every minute that goes by is, you know, basically without even a -- a decision on the merits here, granting the same kind of temporary absolute immunity that the President is seeking here. Justice Kagan? Mr. Dunne, you've been talking about how to analyze these burdens in a case-specific way, the burdens both in terms of the President's time and in terms of any possibility of harassment of the use of a subpoena for political purposes. Mr. Sekulow said that the burdensome nature of these subpoenas is categorical.
That was his term.
And I take him to mean that -- that any subpoena interferes with the President's responsibilities or undermines the President in his handling of the office. So what's the answer to that? Your Honor, I -- I -- may I make three points? I think the fact is that this -- the Court addressed this question, I think, in Clinton and concluded that a President can't realistically be shielded from every sort of private distraction, including some forms of legal process, especially in our modern age. So that's why it's up to a court to evaluate and protect the President, depending on the circumstances, on a case-by-case basis. Secondly, here, the claim of, you know, the possible mental distraction is extreme -- completely speculative really.
It's based on the notion that the President might be, you know, worried and distracted about where an investigation might lead someday. It's not based on any actual Article II burden or interference of the sort the -- the Court was asking President Clinton to demonstrate in Clinton v. Jones. And, third, I'd say, if -- if that's really the concern, I think it's wrong to think that even a categorical rule here would provide comfort to a distractable President like that. So, for example, nobody suggests here that we should be barred from continuing to investigate his, the President's, prior colleagues.
So, if we now gather documents from them that reflect past communications with him while he was CEO, are we then supposed to be stopped because it could create a fear in him that the investigation of others might lead him to be accused of something someday? Again, my point is that this speculative mental distress standard is not an appropriate basis to draw a constitutional bright line.
That's why the case-specific approach is more appropriate. And -- and speculative mental distress -- how about if they really mean political undermining? Well, I mean, if -- that -- that's beyond the ken of our office, Your Honor, and -- and as, again, the district court found, there was no bad faith intended by virtue of our -- our subpoena. So I don't know -- we've -- it's already been determined here there's no intent to politically undermine, so I don't know how a court could try to evaluate that, and I'm not sure that would be appropriate, unless -- unless it's -- Mr. Sekulow -- Mr. Sekulow suggests that you've shown your bad faith by taking the language of the House Oversight Committee's subpoena. Yes, Your Honor, and I think we've -- we're tried to address that.
I mean, the simple fact is that, in 2018, when our investigation started, and -- and thereafter, as we've spelled out, there were a series of public disclosures in the -- in the press about possibly illegal transactions involving tax and other financial improprieties.
And at the time of the House subpoenas and then our subpoena, it was clear that both our office and the House committees were looking at the same public allegations in that regard. In a situation like that, once the House subpoena became public, it's not unusual for an office like ours to model our subpoena language on that which has already been made public from a different source, when it's going to the same recipient.
It makes it easier on the recipient in the process. There was absolutely no communication between our was office and the House about this. There's nothing sinister about it, Your Honor. Thank you. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I'd like to return to your colloquy with Justices Alito and Sotomayor, because I guess I'm uncertain what the daylight is between the test you're proposing and the test the Solicitor General has suggested. It seems like both of you agree that these questions should be resolved in federal court, and you've suggested that there is -- prosecutors should have to be -- demonstrate an objective basis for the investigation and that there's at least a reasonable probability that the information sought will be helpful to that investigation, that it can't be obtained elsewhere and that it's needed now rather than at the end of -- of the President's term because of some serious prejudice that might take place in between. As I understood your discussion with Justice Sotomayor, you -- you suggested that the difference is the Solicitor General thinks there should be an absolute immunity until the end of the term.
I confess I didn't read the brief that way.
I -- I read it as suggesting the district attorney has to show why there's a need for the President's records now rather than at the end of the term. And I -- I understood your discussion with Justice Alito to agree that that would be a relevant consideration.
What am I missing? I think, Your Honor, putting aside the -- the language differences, which I tried to highlight, I think the most important distinction is what I -- I tried to note at the outset, which is the sequencing of the showings that need to be made, because what the DOJ is proposing, as I understand it, is that in the first instance, it has to be the -- the prosecutor who goes to court, goes to federal court in this instance now, and makes an affirmative showing that there -- that the standard has been met, that there's some objective basis and -- and it's -- it's -- it can't be obtained elsewhere, et cetera, et cetera.
And only after such a showing has been made by the prosecutor, according to the DOJ, does the burden then shift to the President to show Article II burden. And I think that's what's completely backwards and inconsistent with Nixon and Clinton.
I think it's much more appropriate for the -- the President, as the moving party, as here, to be required to make a showing as any other litigant would -- would be the case, again, here, we're talking about purely private conduct, to -- to explain why this -- this request somehow impacts not just on, you know, a need to gather documents, which is not the case here, but on an actual Article II burden. And only once that showing has been made should, I think, the burden shift to the prosecution, consistent with past cases by this Court, to explain why, nonetheless, it's still necessary to permit the Court at that point to conduct the -- the balancing of apples and apples in terms of coming to the right conclusion in a -- in a specific case. To me, that's -- So, Mr. Dunne -- so, Mr. Dunne, am I correct in thinking then that you agree that the forum should be federal court, you agree on all the relevant considerations, the necessity of the information, that it can't be obtained elsewhere, the timing issues, all are relevant considerations; it's just who -- who bears the burden? Yes, Your Honor. Is that what you're fighting over? Well, I'm -- maybe with the DOJ there's more -- there's less daylight between us -- than us and the President's lawyers, but I think the important point that I would want to leave the Court with is that, even if one were to adopt that standard or even, frankly, I think the DOJ standard, the fact is we've already met that test given the findings of the courts below. Well, I -- I know you think you win no matter what.
I'm -- I'm just -- we have to write a rule that's presumptively of -- of some value going forward and isn't just about one President, but it's about the presidency. And I'm just trying to understand what daylight actually exists.
And is it fair to say that the only daylight that exists between you and the Solicitor General is who bears the burden of proof? That's right. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.
I'm -- I'm trying to understand. No, Your Honor, I think it is the burden and the difference in the language which I've pointed out to Justice Sotomayor.
I think that language, different -- those differences are important because I don't think that the DOJ's language works in a grand jury investigation. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Dunne.
On that last point that you were talking about with Justice Gorsuch, the difference between the Nixon heightened need standard, you said it doesn't work in a grand jury.
What do you do with Judge Wald's opinion in In Re Sealed Case, which took Nixon and did apply it in a grand jury context? Yes, well, Justice -- Justice Kavanaugh, as I think you mentioned in the earlier argument, the fact remains that In Re Sealed Case was, indeed, applying the Nixon standard as the Nixon Court contemplated to a claim of executive privilege.
And as has been pointed out earlier today, I think that that's a very different analysis to be undertaken for a very different purpose.
And I don't think one can just simply, you know, import that language and apply it to -- Well, let me -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
Let's -- let's leave that for a moment.
But the point on the grand jury versus trial, just on that point, Judge Wald's opinion did take Nixon and apply it in the grand jury context. And -- and, indeed, in -- even in the grand jury context, when we're talking about a privilege analysis, I think that language is appropriate. Okay. Because, at that point, you already have -- once there's been an affirmative showing that established that -- that there is a privilege to be -- to be addressed, then, of course, like with an attorney-client privilege, for example, it's necessary for the Court then to turn to the demand or the request and the documents that are at issue and evaluate them in -- you know, in light of -- Let's -- let's, if we can, move on to the Article II issue then. Do you acknowledge that there's an Article II interest at stake here? Yes. And what do you think it is? I think it's -- it's the Article II interest to be free from unreasonable burdens on the duties and obligations of the presidency.
And that's, you know, the same analysis that was applied, you know, in Nixon and in Clinton. And do you think time -- what Justice Breyer referred to as time and energy distraction are appropriate Article II interests? Well, yes, as a matter of degree.
Again, that was -- that was the Court's analysis in Clinton.
Recall there that, although this Court allowed the litigation to proceed, of course, appropriately, as I think is the case here, there's a need to make sure that the -- the courts that are overseeing this kind of objection are undertaking an analysis of what -- you know, what the burdens are, including at a very practical level. I think the Clinton Court hypothesized that, perhaps, you know, a -- a request for actual in-person testimony at trial by a President might be inappropriate in -- in -- And I think the other side made two distinctions with Clinton, and I want to make sure you have an opportunity to address them.
One is the federal/state.
The other is the civil/criminal. On the civil/criminal, I suppose one thing I'd like to hear you address is, in a civil case, and the Court emphasized this in Clinton versus Jones, there's an individual person at stake who has a claim.
There's not the same in a criminal context.
Obviously, there are different and very important interests there but not the individual interests. Is that -- can you address that? Well, that's -- that's one distinction, Your Honor.
I -- I suppose on the other side of the coin, there is the important difference that, you know, there are, you know, potentially thousands or -- or many more potential private litigants out there who are not bound by the kinds of ethical and jurisdictional and other constraints that prosecutors are bound by and to which this Court has long paid deference. I think that the -- the reason for concern in a -- in a civil context is actually much higher than it should be -- And then -- I'm sorry, if I can get my last question in. On the federal/state, if there is an Article II interest at stake, and you said that there is, it's different, of course, from the executive privilege interest, but there's some Article II interest at stake, I think the other side says it would be odd if the standard were easier to meet for a state prosecutor than for a federal prosecutor.
And I just want to give you an opportunity to address that. Yeah.
Frankly, Your Honor, I don't really understand that distinction.
I think under the analysis that this Court has applied before and the one we're talking about now, the -- the same analysis would apply in terms of a case-specific evaluation in the context of -- of the particular facts of a particular request. So you -- Whether -- Just to stop you there, you're okay with whatever standard applies to a federal prosecutor in a case where there's an Article II interest also applying to the state prosecutor? Well, I -- I'm not sure exactly what you have in mind, Your Honor, but I -- I think the -- Well, I guess the Nixon standard.
You're -- you're not okay with the Nixon standard, I don't think, but I just want to explore that. No, because of the -- the fact that that was applying to claims of executive privilege. But I think, to get to your point, I -- I -- I think what it comes down to is that, you know, in the -- in the Nixon and Clinton cases, we're -- we're talking about, you know, Article III versus -- we're talking about separation of powers analysis. Here, the analogy is we're balancing federalism and Tenth Amendment concerns about police power of the states against the Supremacy Clause.
So it's a different analysis perhaps, but it's very analogous. Thank you. Counsel, we have time for a little bit of a second round, and I guess the thing that I would like to focus on first is this question of how you examine the burden on the -- on the President or the presidency. I just don't understand how it works in terms of you or -- or the President being asked to devote a certain amount of time to reviewing, for example, in this case, the -- the -- the 10 years of documents or whatever. I mean, what is it -- is -- is there supposed to be a hearing where he says, here's what I'm doing, I've got this pandemic thing, you know, China's causing all sorts of trouble? You know, most Presidents throughout their term have a pretty long to-do list.
And I'm just wondering how it's ever going to be any different in evaluating what that burden is.
It seems to me that it would be the same no matter what.
You really wouldn't need a particular hearing on that. Well, I guess, Your Honor, when we're talking about, you know, in -- in the context of a particular subpoena, like this one, or a litigation or what have you, like in -- in Clinton, again, this Court has already decided that you can't shield a -- a president from any sort -- every sort of private distraction. And I just want to emphasize here, again, that -- That was in the -- that was in the civil context.
The question is whether or not a criminal investigation might be a little bit more distracting. Well, I'm -- I'm not sure, Your Honor.
I mean, I'm not sure whether the stigma of, you know, a -- a simple secret grand jury investigation, even if it becomes publicly known, is more distracting and stigmatizing perhaps than being accused even civilly of sexual misconduct, which was, of course, allowed to proceed in the civil case involving President Clinton. So I'm not sure that, again, the abstract concern about, you know, possible mental distraction or even public stigma under this Court's prior analysis is sufficient to adopt a new bright-line constitutional rule that forbids any kind of process like this, given the -- the history. It's a little bit of a -- it's a little bit of a -- that is what the President's personal lawyers advocated. It's not what the Solicitor General advocated, not an absolute rule. Yes, I know, Your Honor. And -- and, therefore, the answer in that case is what's happened here, which is a case-specific analysis before a court, which, as they do all the time, is able to balance and listen to arguments about burdens. And, as here, when the court finds there's no Article II burden whatsoever, after an opportunity to be heard, that should be the answer.
And -- and that's what's happened here. Justice Thomas, anything further? One brief question, Mr. Dunne.
There's been much discussion about burdens on the President.
I'd like from you a couple of specific examples of what you think a burden would be that actually counts in your analysis on the part of the President. Well, I guess, Your Honor, again, hypothetically, because our -- our subpoena imposes, we say, no burden whatsoever. I understand that. But I -- I -- I think I would -- I would again point to this Court's language in the Clinton analysis where it -- it was -- you know, it was observed in passing in the opinion, I think just as dicta, but it was relevant that, you know, if -- if a president was asked to actually appear and testify at trial someday someplace outside of the White House, that might be the kind of thing that you'd say really shouldn't have to happen. I would suggest there along those lines too that if -- if there -- if a president were to be -- were -- were to be asked to produce -- show up for multiple days of consecutive deposition testimony or something like that, those -- those kinds -- those are practical burdens, or if -- if the demands were that he show up at a particular time or place that is -- you know, where there are conflicts and that kind of thing, again, since we're talking here about private conduct and no executive privilege, what we get to are really practical concerns about impositions on -- on presidential activities.
And that's, I think, what we're talking about. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg, anything further? Nothing further. Justice Breyer? No, thank you.
Go ahead. Justice Alito? One quick question.
I don't know how good this Court is about predicting the consequences of some of our decisions, but would you say that the -- the Court's prediction in -- in Clinton versus Jones that the decision wouldn't have much of an impact on the Presidency has been borne out by history? I guess, Your Honor, I -- I -- my view of the chronology in Clinton v. Jones, I'll try to be brief, is that I -- I think, contrary to some people's view of history, I think that the -- the -- the district court, following this Court's decision, kept a rather close rein on discovery in that case and, don't forget, later granted summary judgment in favor of the President long before trial. It was only that it came out later, of course, that it turns out that in his brief deposition in the case that the President committed perjury, which is what led to the impeachment proceedings and other travails he had. So I don't think it was this Court's opinion or the litigation itself that led to those problems.
Frankly, it was his decision to lie under oath. So I -- I -- I don't -- I think that this -- this Court's conclusion in both Nixon and Clinton that they could not -- you could not, you know, accept the notion there's going to be a parade of horribles, either in a particular case or across the board, still has borne out over history. Justice Sotomayor? I'm not sure that I understood your statement earlier that the only difference between you and the SG -- well, there are two differences, one in -- in the articulation of special needs or heightened standard, but you said it's the burden of proof. But you've already conceded to -- to one of my colleagues that there is an automatic burden on an article -- on the Article II clause by subpoenaing a sitting president, period. No, I've not -- I've not, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, but I have not -- I have not conceded that. All right.
What then are you conceding when you say there's a burden? I'm -- I'm conceding -- And -- and what kind of burden are you talking about? And, number three, articulate more precisely what problems you have with the heightened standard that Nixon set in its grand jury subpoena. Yeah, I guess, in my response, I think, to Justice Gorsuch, my concern -- my -- what I acknowledged was that, yes, a subpoena like this implicates Article II issues and potential burdens, and it's those which have to be weighed in a case-specific analysis. I wasn't conceding that the mere fact of a subpoena imposes ""an Article II burden."" I think that's -- that's the distinction I would -- I would -- I would draw. And, again, getting back to the language question, I -- again, it's the DOJ's language that calls for a stringent showing that a request is directly relevant to central issues at trial and specific charging decisions. And, again, very simply, as a practical matter, no court and no prosecutor could -- could meet that standard because, in a grand jury, one is not thinking about charging decisions or central issues at trial.
And that's why I think the simple language that the DOJ is -- is applying in its new heightened showing standard is just not workable. Justice Kagan? Mr. Dunne, on -- on the question of a possible distinction between state prosecutors and federal prosecutors, the President's lawyers have urged that there's a legal difference arising from the Supremacy Clause.
And I don't think we've talked about that argument yet. What -- what is your response to that? I think the response, Your Honor, is -- I alluded to it before.
But I think all it means is that there is a -- a balance to be struck between, in this case, the state prosecutors, the Supremacy Clause concerns, against the rights of states under their police powers and the concepts of federalism and the -- the requirements of the Tenth Amendment to allow the states to exercise their -- their rights, especially in the criminal context, which, you know, are -- are so important. So I think that that's the parallel to the -- the balancing in the -- in the federal prosecutor context, but I think it's even more important given the federalism concerns and the fact that, you know, state prosecutors, of course, not only do they have the reserve police power of the states, but in -- in context of criminal investigations, there, a large body of criminal conduct is only prosecutable by the states.
So that's the thing that has to be balanced here. Justice Gorsuch? Nothing further. Thank you, Chief. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. I just wanted to ask again, deferral of the investigation until after the presidency, assuming statute of limitations issues were solved -- which is a big assumption, I understand -- can you tick off the concerns you would have about that so that we have those clear? Yes.
Yes, Justice Kavanaugh.
Again, it's -- point number one would be the -- putting aside statute of limitations concern, which I don't think one can discount here because I don't think it's been addressed, you know, ever, obviously, by this Court in -- in this context, and that's what we're -- that's our paramount concern, to be honest, at this point because the clock is ticking. But even if that were to be addressed somehow, the risk of -- you know, over time by waiting, of losing evidence and losing witnesses and that kind of thing is a very real risk. Again, I think the OLC Moss memo addressed that expressly in -- in saying that a grand jury proceeding should be allowed to proceed. But, secondly, here -- and it's not unusual -- since there are other third-parties at issue in the investigation, requiring us to delay because a president is still in office as to those third-parties in -- in gathering important evidence could yield them being above the law if the statute of limitations runs as to them. Thank you. Mr. -- Mr. Dunne, would you like a minute or two to wrap up? Yes, Your Honor, thank you. Your Honors, the issue presented here today is extremely narrow but extremely important.
We have a state investigation that's well founded, implicates no official conduct or executive privilege, involves a variety of third-parties, faces serious time constraints, and has been found to impose no Article II burdens. These facts put our subpoena well within the scope of legal process permitted by this Court for generations, indeed, back to 1807.
Past decisions have consistently found that courts already have robust tools to protect presidents from abusive claims or demands. There's no need here to upend precedent or to write a new rule that undermines federalism, especially when such a rule would create a risk that American presidents, as well as third-parties, could unwittingly end up above the law. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sekulow, you have two minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start with this, and there's some agreement.
The New York district attorney, New York County district attorney, acknowledges that their subpoena implicates Article II issues and burdens.
They also agree that there is harms that could arise to the presidency.
We say those harms have actually existed. The other aspect of this is the ordering, who carries the burden here.
That seems to be the issue that's left open.
This Court's decision in Cheney answered that very clearly, that said that the exacting standard is carried by the party requesting the information. So it would be carried by the Respondent in this particular case. There has been no showing and no findings of heightened need standards being met here.
That -- and I think it's again also important to remember -- and I think this came up in the context of earlier questioning -- there's a different stigma that attaches to criminal process than civil litigation.
And I don't think that stigma should be ignored in a case like this. But the irony of all of this is that the House of Representatives and the district attorney issued essentially the same subpoenas to the same custodian for the same records. The House said it wants the records so it can legislate, not for law enforcement reasons.
The district attorney says he wants the same records for law enforcement reasons; he has no legislative authority. But what's really happening here could not be clearer.
The presidency is being harassed and undermined with improper process that was issued, in our view, for illegitimate reasons.
The copying of the subpoena speaks to that. The framers saw this coming, and they structured the Constitution to protect the President from this encroachment. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",0.0
"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-46, United States Patent and Trademark Office versus Booking.com. Ms. Ross. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is a fundamental principle of trademark law that no party can obtain a trademark for a generic term like ""wine,"" ""cotton,"" or ""grain."" As Judge Friendly explained and as the Lanham Act confirmed, a generic term is never entitled to trademark protection no matter how much money and effort the user has poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what success it has achieved in securing public identification. In other words, secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness is simply irrelevant to generic terms.
That principle controls here. It is undisputed that ""booking"" is generic for the hotel reservation services Respondent provides.
Respondent thus could not federally register ""Booking."" Nor could Respondent register ""Booking Company"" or ""Booking Inc."" In Goodyear, this Court held that the mere addition of an entity designation like ""Company"" or ""Inc."" to an unprotectable term does not create a protectable mark.
That is because those terms indicate only that parties have formed an association or partnership to deal in the relevant goods.
By prohibiting a first adopter from obtaining a trademark in a phrase like ""Booking Inc.,"" Goodyear ensured that no party can monopolize a generic term. The same result should apply to Booking.com.
The addition of "".com"" is the on-line equivalent of ""Company"" or ""Inc."" It conveys only that Respondent provides its services via a commercial website on the Internet.
There is no sound reason for Respondent to be able to federally register ""Booking.com"" as a trademark when it couldn't register ""Booking, Inc."" Registration would effectively give Respondent a monopoly on the words ""Booking.com"" and would interfere with competitors' ability to use similar domain names.
That's particularly problematic because it's how the Internet works. Only one entity can obtain the contractual rights to a domain name at a time.
So Respondent already enjoys significant competitive advantages that brick-and-mortar equivalents like ""Booking Inc."" would lack. That same feature of the Internet also means that if Respondent's survey evidence is enough to obtain federal trademark registration, that nearly every generic.com business can do the same.
Because domain names are one of a kind, a significant portion of the public will always understand a generic "".com"" term to refer to a specific business, even if it is not familiar with the particular business at issue -- Counsel -- -- thus resulting in -- -- counsel, you mentioned the Goodyear case, but you did not quote the language from the trademark statute that is at issue here.
That language says that the primary significance of the mark to the public shall be the test for determining whether the mark has become generic. Now the Goodyear case had a different test, an absolute rule.
And it seems to me that, in trying to decide what Congress had in mind, it makes more sense to follow the language that Congress chose in the statute rather than a 130-year-old case of ours. So, Mr. Chief Justice, two points on that.
The first is that the Lanham Act actually preserves a distinction between generic and descriptive terms.
And so generic terms, it confirms -- and this is both in the definitional provision and then again in Section 1025 E and F -- or 1052, excuse me, E and F, confirms that generic terms are never susceptible to trademark registration even when they acquire secondary meaning, and descriptive terms, merely descriptive terms, may acquire trademark significance when they acquire secondary meaning.
So I think the Lanham Act preserves sort of the underlying principle of Goodyear. Now, moving to Section 1064(3) specifically, the cancellation provision that you note, that's on page 11-A of our appendix. It says the primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public, rather than purchaser motivation, shall be the test for determining whether the measure -- the registered mark has become the generic name of goods or services. I think it's significant here that that provision was enacted in 1984.
Respondent has pointed to no case and no source before its own brief suggesting that it overturned this Court's -- It was enacted -- -- decision in Goodyear. -- it was enacted in 1984, but that's a lot closer to today than the Goodyear case, which was 130 years ago.
So I don't know why we would focus more on the statutory language than that -- that old -- old case. But more -- more to the point maybe, that if this is a generic term, Booking.com, that means that it describes a category of goods or services.
But, when you talk about other companies in that category, whether it's Travelocity, Priceline, or whatever, nobody refers to those as -- as Booking.coms. Booking.com is not a generic term to describe that type of -- of service. So, again, a few points on that, Mr. Chief Justice.
The first is that we agree that in the ordinary case, one might use the term ""generic"" to refer, or to understand it, how the -- the consumers generally refer to a class of goods, but I think it can also be used, as this Court's decision in Goodyear used it, for how a specific entity or how the public would understand a specific term. So, for example, in Goodyear, the Court held that Goodyear, Inc. could not be, or Wine, Inc., for example, could not be trademarked, and that's true even though nobody refers to a class of Wine, Incorporated. Thank you -- The point here is -- -- thank you -- -- that the decision -- -- thank you -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes, Ms. Ross.
The -- a couple of questions. The -- could Booking acquire an 800 number, for ex -- that's a vanity number, 1-800-booking, for example, that is similar to, for -- 1-800-plumbing, which is a registered mark? So, Justice Thomas, under the Federal Circuit's decisions, yes, it could. Those decisions, I think, may -- are -- are sort of debatable under Goodyear and the principles that we think control here, but the Federal Circuit -- the PTO, rather, does follow those decisions because of the right of direct appeal to the Federal Circuit from PTO decisions. Now I think it's significant that those are distinguishable in the sense that the core problem with Booking.com is that it allows Respondent to monopolize booking on the Internet because of the fact that longer domain names of Respondent's competitors, like ebooking.com and hotelbooking.com, can include Booking.com.
That is not as obviously true of something like 1-800-booking. Well, the -- that -- that -- that could be true, but the -- I'd like you to compare this to Goodyear.
In Goodyear, you had a generic term, but you also had added a term such as company or inc., which any company could use. Now, with booking, here, there can only be one domain address "".com."" So this would seem to be more analogous to the 1-800 numbers, which are also individualized. So, Your Honor, you're completely correct that only one Internet entity at a time can hold the domain name rights to Booking.com.
I think that actually works in our favor rather than Respondent's for a few reasons. The first is that Respondent doesn't actually argue that every domain name should get a trademark, as I think would be the consequence of Your Honor's position there.
I think the reason that Respondent doesn't do that, again, is because, if that's good for Respondent, then it's good for ebooking.com and hotelbooking.com, and then I think the risk of confusion analysis on the back end would also have to account for the fact that each of those is unique.
And so Respondent would wind up with a very thin trademark protection. Putting that to one side, in the usual case of trademark, what a register -- what a registrant wants is the ability both to exclude others from using the same name and to -- to exclude others from using names that are confusingly similar.
Because of the functional nature of the Internet, Respondent already has that first advantage. So others can't use Booking.com on-line, and their competitors won't want to use those -- those terms in their promotional materials because that will direct customers to Respondent's website rather than their own. So the point here -- and this, you know, is why generic .com terms garner so much money on the Internet.
The point, I think, of this case, what really matters, is the second type of usage, the ability to block out competitors like ebooking.com and hotelbooking.com.
And I think that's exactly the type of anticompetitive concern that this Court expressed in Goodyear, that if you allow one company to have Booking, Inc. or Booking Company, it's going to preclude others from calling their goods by their name and from marketing themselves as what they are. Now I think, you know, the -- Judge Wynn explains this very well in the court of appeals dissent at pages 28A to 29A of our appendix.
What Respondent wants here is something it couldn't get in the brick-and-mortar world.
So usually we require businesses to decide whether to adopt a generic name upfront, and that allows them to get easy recognition from consumers who automatically understand what they sell -- Thank you, counsel. -- but we don't allow the space for -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg? Two questions.
The first question is, if you're right that .com doesn't make a generic term non-generic, how many marks, already registered marks, would be subject to cancellation? I take it there are dozens of "".coms"" that have been registered.
Is that so? So, Justice Ginsburg, I think Respondent suggests that there are far more than there actually are.
If I can make just a few points on this.
The first is that the TTAB, which is how the PTO speaks precedentially, has been consistent on this point, and the examiner decisions in our appendix as well as the courts of appeals other than the court below. So, by and large, our rule is being followed out in the world, so I don't think that there is going to be this huge change. Now Respondent does point to some examples, but I think those examples show a few flaws.
One of those flaws is that Respondent seems to think that on our rule, the combination of any two nouns or any noun and an ""ng"" designation is always going to be generic. That's simply not true.
You always have to look at how the two terms are being used. So, for example, Respondent looks at the Cheesecake Factory, but, of course, that's not a literal factory producing cheesecakes. It's a restaurant.
So I don't think Cheesecake Factory -- I wanted you to focus on cancellation.
Who could apply to cancel an existing registration? So I do believe -- If we -- if we rule in your favor, would the PTO itself endeavor to cancel these marks? I don't believe so, Your Honor.
I think that competitors could, under Section 1064, file petitions to cancel registrations.
And, of course, the fact that it was generic would allow registration -- or, excuse me, cancellation at any point. Now I think that those same entities could have brought cases previously based on, again, the binding law of the Federal Circuit and the TTAB, which is and was consistent on this point.
So, again, I think, because Respondent's appendix sort of greatly overstates the number of marks that actually have been incorrectly registered, we don't have a fear that there will be a huge backlash if the rules change. And -- and to explain a little bit more why I think that's so, Respondent points to not just examples like Cheesecake Factory -- I'm sorry, I have another question I wanted to ask you, and it's a follow-up to Justice Thomas. Your answer to the telephone number question, 1-800-Booking, was, well, that's the Federal Circuit precedent.
But it would be our job in this case to deal with that if the Federal Circuit is wrong. Do you have another distinction for the 1-800, say, Mattress or Booking, that would distinguish it from the domain name? Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
So I think the other distinction is that, again, Booking.com can be encapsulated in longer domain names in the -- in a way that 1-800 booking or booking itself really couldn't be in longer phone numbers. So there's sort of a -- a sort of de facto reason why the same competitive risks aren't there.
I think it's also worth -- Thank you -- -- taking a step back -- Thank you, counsel.
Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer? The same question as Justice Thomas's question.
Good morning anyway. And to Justice Thomas's question, Justice Ginsburg -- what do you want to say about that? You can have a -- a trademark that is an address, 1418 35th Street or something.
You have a trademark that's an address.
You can have a trademark that's a telephone number.
So why can't you have a trademark that's a "".com""? So, again, Justice Breyer, and good morning, I -- I think that it is clear from Goodyear that Goodyear balanced these competing objectives that are always true in trademark law in this very similar context of ""Booking Company."" We think ""Booking Company"" and ""Booking.com"" are essentially equivalent. All ""Booking.com"" tells you is that there is a website on the Internet for booking.
It tells you it's a type of service that's sort of a classic generic usage.
And we think that that follows from Goodyear. Now Goodyear, as I was saying, sort of balanced these two competing interests.
On the one hand, we want to make sure that consumers understand that the good they got last time is from a particular brand, and so we want strong brand identification, and we protect trademarks for that reason. On the other hand, we want to avoid monopolization of language.
And I think that's exactly the concern that Goodyear had with ""Booking dot"" -- or, excuse me, with ""Booking ""Company"" and ""Booking Inc."" or ""Wine Company"" and ""Grain Company"" and ""Grain Inc."" in the words of Goodyear.
And it's exactly the same concern that we have on the Internet here because, again, by using Booking.com and by getting a trademark on ""Booking.com,"" Respondent necessarily must want to be able to block out ""ebooking.com"" and ""hotelbooking.com"" and similar names.
I think, again, because Respondent couldn't do that in the brick-and-mortar world, there's no reason why it should be allowed to do it on the Internet. Now you noted that you could have sort of a street address as a trademark, but I think that's fundamentally different because, of course, that's not telling you anything at all about the services.
So the -- the registrant there would still have to work to build up its brand recognition in the same way that a person who uses a inherently distinctive mark like Amazon has to do.
They don't get this sort of up-front benefit from using a generic term where everyone now knows that they provide, in Respondent's case, on-line booking services and all of the concomitant benefits on the Internet that go with that, such as, again, the fact that other competitors can't use that name and the consumers will go to Booking.com expecting that to be a site for booking -- for on-line booking even if there's no particular knowledge on the part of the consumer about that website. Thank you. Justice Alito? What do you think I should do if I think that Goodyear is a case from a different era and doesn't control here but also think that the Lanham Act, similarly, was enacted in a different era, namely, in the pre-Internet era, and that the case law on which Ms. Blatt relies belongs to that era? How can a rule that makes sense in the Internet age be reconciled with the language of the Lanham Act? So I think, Justice Alito, it's pretty easily reconcilable with the Lanham Act.
And I want to go back to the Chief Justice's first question about the primary significance test. Again, the primary significance test is sort of cabined necessarily, in the statute at least, to cancellation of a mark that was already considered distinctive, so this comes up in cases like Teflon and Kodak and things where it's a coined term. And so the -- as Respondent concedes in their brief, it's a very narrow rule.
In 1984, Congress passed this amendment to overturn a specific Ninth Circuit case that had applied a different test in the cancellation context. Now it is true that other courts have applied similar analyses in other places, but that's because of the preexisting common law. So, for that reason, we think Goodyear continues to control for the same reason that this other preexisting common law does. But even taking a view sort of outside of Goodyear, as I take your question to suggest, even without Goodyear, you have this very basic trademark policy that has always been true, which is that generic terms simply are not susceptible to appropriation by a particular business, even when there's secondary meanings. This Court recognized that in Two Pesos following the Lanham Act, citing Judge Friendly's quintessential sort of categories of terms, and I think it remains true on the Internet, just as it remains true in the brick-and-mortar world.
Again, I think trademark is always trying to make this balance between competition and brand recognition on the one hand and fear of monopolization on the other. And I think the fear of monopolization side here really speaks very strongly to our position because, again, Respondent's view would allow them to monopolize any term. I think it's worth noting, on pages 6 and 8 of Respondent's brief, their test actually requires them, I think, to hedge as to whether the words ""Oranges"" or ""Oranges, Inc."" or, I presume, ""Oranges.com"" would be generic.
So, on their view, ""Oranges"" remains generic if and only if a survey shows that the public continues to think of that as ""the spherical fruit of the same color."" I think that would be a surprising outcome under trademark law, whether in the brick-and-mortar world or on the Internet. Now the other point that Respondent makes with respect to the -- the codification of the primary significance test, you know, I don't think it's actually the primary significance test that's the core of Respondent's argument. Respondent's argument is much more that that test must always and in all circumstance require looking to survey evidence and giving that survey evidence dispositive weight. I think that's not true under Goodyear, which I think is wholly reconcilable with the primary significance test, because Goodyear itself, on page 602 of the opinion, rejected evidence as legally irrelevant that one particular defendant had sort of the best claim to public association.
Again, that's consistent with the Lanham Act -- Counsel -- -- in Section -- Justice Sotomayor? Justice Sotomayor? I'm sorry, Chief. Ms. Ross, picking up on where you were right now, is it your position that the primary significance test to the public is never to be used in determining what's generic and what's not, or is it -- and if we don't use that test at least in whole or in part, however much you want, what other things would a PTO examiner look to? Justice Sotomayor, it's not our position that the -- the courts and the PTO can never look to the primary significance test outside of cancellation.
Again, I think that the reason why courts and the PTO do that is because the Lanham Act didn't overturn preexisting common law, and that, again, speaks to why we think Goodyear remains good law. But I think what courts should do in this instance is look to other sources to figure out what, again, a generic term -- whether something is a generic term, which usually means whether it is going to indicate the type of good or service. So dictionary definitions are very helpful in this regard, the use by other competitors, like, again, ""hotelbooking.com"" and ""ebooking.com"" here, and similar sources.
What I think you should -- what courts and the PTO shouldn't do is give dispositive weight to survey evidence that, as the trademark scholars' brief by Professor Tushnet explains, is going to cause some issues in these particular circumstances. So, again, because of the functional nature of the Internet, because everyone understands that a certain -- that only one entity at a time can hold the domain name ""Booking.com,"" surveys are going to misrepresent the number of people who actually understand that Booking.com is a business as opposed to only infer that because of the way the Internet works. Now I think -- Ms. Ross, may I -- -- if we really did -- Ms. Ross, may I? Let me stop you there for a moment. Of course. I looked at your definitions of ""booking"" and, basically, one definition said booking a hotel, but this service is much broader than that.
You can book a hotel, you can book leisure, you can book travel, you can book cars. So that may be a problem with my looking at ""booking"" as generic, but my point being that if I look at all the evidence you point to, ebooking, car booking, hotel booking, that a finder of fact could well conclude that Booking.com is, in fact, related to one entity and not to a -- a -- has become more a descriptive word than a generic phrase. Justice Sotomayor, I think I -- I think this was not presented here and I disagree on the merits.
So I think it's not presented here in that Respondent has acknowledged -- is no longer contesting that ""booking"" is generic for the relevant class of services here, and that's the hotel -- the on-line hotel reservation services. To go to your broader point, you know, I think this actually speaks to the problem with a lot of Respondent's examples, which is to say you're always looking at the particular category and the particular -- for which the goods or -- or services are being registered and the usage. Now, on this idea that -- Thank you -- -- while maybe it -- -- thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Good morning, Ms. Ross.
A couple -- one short question first. I'm -- I'm right in saying that you're advocating for a categorical rule here, am I not? In other words, you're not saying that trademarks of this kind will rarely be registered -- registrable; you're saying that they will never be registrable.
Is that correct? I think it depends a little bit, Justice Kagan, on what you mean by ""trademarks of this kind."" We think that when you're simply appending .com -- Generic .com, Bookings.com, Booking.com. Sure.
So Booking.com and other -- other phrases where the combination doesn't add any additional meaning, so like I mean to distinguish cases like the courts of appeals have hypothesized, like tennis.net, where there's sort of an interplay between the two words on either side of the period.
We don't think that those would necessarily -- that those could necessarily never provide for trademark protection.
We just don't think that's really presented here. But -- And am I right -- is that why -- you know, the PTO takes a much less categorical position.
It says, well, those .coms will typically not add source identifying significance, but it doesn't say never.
Why is that? What's the -- why -- why is there a difference between what the PTO examiners' manual says and what you say? So I don't think there actually is a difference, Justice Kagan.
I think what the PTO is leaving open, again, is this category, this very narrow category of rare cases that the Federal Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have recognized. I think what Respondent would do is to expand that category.
I mean, Respondent has tried to say that this is sort of the rare case, but, as I was explaining earlier, I think basically every generic .com case is going to have this type of evidence because of people's knowledge of how the Internet works. So I think we're not asking -- Ms. Ross, in -- in your brief, you say, you know, you're -- you're -- you're not making the argument that people go around talking about Booking.coms, but you're instead saying that Booking.com is generic -- and this is on page 44 of your brief -- because customers would understand the term to convey only that the -- the company provides on-line booking services and the term conveys no additional meaning that would distinguish Respondent's services from those of other providers. And I guess, when I think about that test, I think, well, maybe or maybe not.
If -- if the test is what you say, is what is a consumer going to understand and does the term convey additional meaning that would distinguish the Respondent's services from others, I kind of think, well, may -- maybe it would.
Well, so how does that test go along with a categorical rule? So I think, Justice Kagan, to the extent that you think it could convey to consumers some additional meaning, that additional meaning -- and really the only additional meaning that Respondent has ever pointed to -- is this idea that it points you to a particular website. So that, I think, both because it's a functional feature of the Internet to which we don't usually give trademark protection and for all of the competition-based reasons I was noting earlier, I think that can't be enough to get them over the line. They've never made an argument -- again, the -- the -- sort of the key distinction between generic and descriptive terms is that a generic term identifies the type of good or service, whereas the descriptive -- a descriptive term tells you something about a feature or a characteristic of the service. So, for example, apple pie, generic for pies, but descriptive for rooms, rooms -- But suppose, Ms. Ross -- sorry to interrupt.
Suppose, Ms. Ross, that you lose on your argument on a categorical rule. Is there something else that the Court would -- that you would like the Court to include in an opinion about how to evaluate registration claims for generic .com marks? In other words, if categorical is a -- is a bridge too far, is there -- is there something else that we should be thinking about in terms of saying when it is that generic marks are registrable? So a few points, Your Honor.
I think, first, we obviously think that the Court should follow Goodyear.
And so I think what Goodyear said was that generic company terms ""without further specification"" won't be enough to get trademark protection.
I think that that is essentially the rule that we're asking for here. Right.
But you're not -- they're not. Brief -- briefly, Ms. Ross. Sure.
I think we would want the -- at -- at a bare minimum, the risk of confusion analysis on the back end to be extremely sensitive to the fact that what's driving the intuition is the uniqueness of the domain name.
And so that equally applies to Respondent's competitors. Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I'd like to follow up on that and -- and just give you another minute to -- to continue answering that question. Suppose we -- the Court does not accept your bright-line rule.
How would you advise the Court to write an opinion that draws on and points to the sensitivity necessary in this area? Sure.
So a couple of points, Justice Gorsuch.
The first is that I think, again, even if the Court did not think that Goodyear firmly controlled here, as we do, I think it is very indicative of the right type of analysis in terms of the concern with monopolizing language. As I was saying earlier -- Let's -- let's put Goodyear aside for the moment.
Okay? Again, I -- I -- I know you want us to go there.
But put that aside for the moment.
What would you have the Court say? Certainly.
So I would want the Court to recognize, as the Lanham Act, I think, commands, again, in Sections 1052 E and F, that generic terms generally are not susceptible to trademark registration based on secondary meaning. And so Respondent, like all generic .coms, would have to come forward with some evidence other than simply this secondary idea that, yes, this is a -- a term that just tells me that it's an on-line booking agency, but consumers have come to understand it as something else. I think blurring that distinction can have really bad consequences outside of the .com context.
So, again, the oranges or Oranges, Incorporated example where everything is now subject to survey evidence. So I would want the Court to make clear -- I -- I guess that -- that leads to my -- my next question, and that is, why aren't existing doctrinal tools under the Lanham Act sufficient? Because we do -- always, in every case, not just this area, would take very seriously questions about consumer confusion. And it seems to me a lot of your argument on -- on competition law policy issues is concerned with consumer confusion.
The Lanham Act accounts for that.
And then it seems like you're also concerned about the use of a generic term, but fair use doctrine is designed to account for that. So why aren't there sufficient doctrinal tools to address the concern, the competition law concerns you've raised, and why isn't this just another example of where intellectual property and monopolization concerns intersect and we have to respect the judgment Congress made in this particular area? So, Justice Gorsuch, there's a lot in that question.
I think that, you know, my first-line answer, of course, is that we think that the tools are sufficient. They just point in our direction. Now I -- I think that the fact that generic terms can't be trademarked even upon a showing of secondary meaning under the Lanham Act is itself enough to resolve this case. Now, moving on from there, you know, you mentioned the risk of confusion analysis.
I think it's notable that Respondent in their brief says we should get a -- a trademark on Booking.com, but if ebooking.com comes -- and a large part of that is because we're unique -- but, if ebooking.com comes along, we should win in a risk of confusion analysis because we were here first. Now I think if it's sort of good for the goose, good for the gander, if ebooking -- or if Booking.com gets trademark protection because it's unique, then it seems as though ebooking.com should get equal protection because it, too, is unique.
So I -- I don't think that sort of the -- the competition concerns are necessarily resolved under existing trademark law.
I think you would actually have to -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Ross.
Respondent says there's no threat of monopoly with domain -- domain names because they're unique, and they say they wouldn't, in fact, be concerned about ebooking.com or similar names in their brief. So what are the real-world practical problems you foresee if .coms could obtain trademarks? Thank you, Justice Kavanaugh.
So, again, I think the real-world practical problem is, one, I don't read Respondent actually to say that they wouldn't think that ebooking.com were infringing.
They say, sure, go ahead and register it, but, if it turns out consumers are confused, then we think we -- we get the -- the territory and you don't. So I do think there is a very real risk of monopolization in that sense.
The other risk, though, I think, is that, you know, Respondent is already getting, as I mentioned earlier, these huge first mover advantages from the fact that it and only it can control Booking.com on the Internet.
And so it is asking for this privilege that no business would have in the real world of both getting the really exacerbated first mover advantages of using a generic name and then also getting the back-end trademark protection. And I guess I don't see why the Internet context should permit that, again, given that it already gives Respondent these huge advantages. I also think this is sort of a -- a -- maybe a lesser level, but, you know, if it's true that Booking.com and presumably every other trademark -- or, excuse me, every other domain name can get a trademark, then you're going to have this problem where the trademark system is basically becoming a domain name registry system.
It's just duplicative of that.
And I'm not sure why, rather than following sort of bedrock trademark principles like generic terms can't get trademark protection, no ""Booking Company,"" therefore no ""Booking.com,"" the Court would go in that direction of essentially just having a quasi DNR for -- for Internet generic "".com"" names. Respondent also points out that there have been registrations of ""Booking.com"" in other countries, the EU, the United Kingdom.
Can you respond to that? Sure, Justice Kavanaugh. You know, I think that may well be true.
I don't think it's particularly relevant here. Obviously, those other countries aren't focusing or aren't constrained by Goodyear, as we think this Court is.
And -- and they're not constrained by the Lanham Act, as we think this Court is.
And, obviously, again, I think the Lanham Act preserves that core understanding of Goodyear, which is no company can obtain a trademark on a generic term, even if it shows that the public has come to associate it with its goods.
And that's all Respondent has argued for here. Thank you. Ms. Ross, why don't you take a minute to wrap up. Sure.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. So I think our basic points are simple.
We think our rule flows directly from Goodyear.
"".com"" is simply the on-line version of ""company,"" and it tells you only that Respondent operates a commercial website via the Internet where bookings can be made.
We think it's consistent with the Lanham Act's preservation of this distinction between generic and descriptive terms and with long-standing trademark policy. Respondent's rule, by contrast, would require overturning Goodyear, blurring the Lanham Act's line between generic and descriptive marks, and permitting the monopolization of generic terms on-line.
And for all of those reasons, we would respectfully ask that the Court reverse. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about how to tell the difference between descriptive names the Lanham Act protects and generic ones the Act does not. There are three reasons this Court should hold that the answer is the primary significance test, that is, whether consumers primarily think the name is a genus or a potential brand. First, the Act mandates this test.
Second, the Act abrogated Goodyear.
And, third, this test furthers the statutory purpose to let consumers decide which marks deserve trademark protection. First, the text.
The Act has always required, in Sections 1052, 1091, and 1127, trademark registration if a mark helps consumers distinguish among brands.
In other words, the Act protects descriptive names, which consumers find useful, but it excludes generic ones, which consumers think just refer to a genus.
The Lanham Act thus codified the law of unfair competition, which had protected descriptive but not generic names. And right before Congress passed the Act, this Court in Kellogg adopted the primary significance test under unfair competition law to distinguish between generic and descriptive names.
For the past 70 years, courts have embraced this primary significance test to tell the difference under the Lanham Act. And it was against this universal backdrop that Congress later codified the primary significance test in Section 1064 to overrule a decision departing from this test in the cancellation context; 1064 thus reflects Congress's ratification of the primary significance test to define a generic name in all contexts.
The government has no other test for the dividing line other than primary significance. Second, Goodyear did not survive the Lanham Act.
The Act repudiates, root to branch, any per se rule that an island of words are generic as a matter of law regardless of consumers' views. First, Sections 1052, 1091, and 1127 necessarily define generic names as ones that do not help consumers distinguish among brands, because everything else must be registered.
And the factual question about what consumers think is the antithesis of a per se rule. Thank you -- thank you, counsel. You rely heavily on the primary significance test, but that is only in the provision of the statute dealing with cancellation of marks.
And, of course, this is not a cancellation case; it's a registration case.
So why should we assume that the primary significance test carries the weight that you would give it? Sure.
So, like I just said, the -- 1064, we think, is a ratification of the law as if you're looking at the dividing line between what's a generic term and what's a descriptive term.
And the specific amendment was to overrule a decision that had come up in the cancellation context, so it was targeted to that Ninth Circuit anti-monopoly case. In terms of the primary significance test, though, if you ignore Section 1064, there is still no other test than other than one that decides -- that looks to what consumers think of the mark, because three provisions, regardless of 1064, require registration of marks that help consumers distinguish among brands.
So, by definition -- Well, maybe one reason that Congress put this in the cancellation section and not in the registration section is because they appreciated the significance of Goodyear with respect to registration of marks. That -- that -- I don't think that can be right because, again, Goodyear is a -- Goodyear is a common law rule.
Let me just talk about Goodyear. Goodyear is a common law rule that is based on the principle under common law that no mark could be trademarked if competitors could, with equal truth, hypothetically say that about the mark.
And so Goodyear, by its terms, interchangeably uses the word ""generic"" and ""descriptive"" marks.
And that was true because common law didn't care.
Both were off limits. And so the Court in Goodyear specifically said ""Wine Company"" is no different than ""Lackawanna coal"" and ""Pennsylvania wheat,"" which are descriptive terms.
And the Court said both are off limits. Now this Court in five -- five cases at the time right after Goodyear described Goodyear as not only a case about descriptive terms, but two cases, Lawrence Manufacturing and P.D. Beckwith, which are cited on page 28 of the government's brief, for the equal truth principle, and that's where the government -- I think it didn't mean to -- but it basically says bookyear -- ""booking"" does not deserve a trademark because everyone with equal truth could be a booking company.
And we know -- Counsel, there -- -- the Lanham Act -- -- there are a lot of companies that use booking in their -- the second-level domain, ebooking.com, hotelbooking.com, eurobookings.com, travelbooking.com. If you succeed in trademarking Booking.com, then these competitors will be impeded from using that term, which is an accurate description of the services and goods that they -- they provide. So I -- I don't think that's correct. Isn't that something that we should take into consideration? Sure.
And like you should take into consideration with all marks that are descriptive.
I mean, our bottom-line position is that "".com"" marks should be treated the same. But there are three reasons why you shouldn't worry about what the government's -- their -- their sort of, you know, concerns about anti-monopolization.
First, the concerns are just in a brief.
They don't give you a single, not a single, example of harm, despite the ubiquity of generic-word "".com"" marks and the fact that Booking.com is registered in 85 other countries, including ones that -- Could you quickly note what your second and third reasons are? Yes.
So let me get to the third reason, which I think is the legal reason in terms of why it doesn't crowd out.
The more descriptive a mark is, the harder it is for that mark to show a likelihood of confusion, a requisite element in any infringement claim. And the ease with -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Thank -- thank you, Chief. The -- just getting back to the Chief's question, Ms. Blatt, you -- you seem to rely almost exclusively on the primary significance test.
Do you need that test in order to prevail here? No, because, regardless of what you think of our test, the government can't be right because three statutory provisions that don't mention primary significance test overrule, repudiate, abrogate, and completely eradicate any notion that you could have a per se rule that would ignore what consumers think, which is why the Court in Qualitex didn't need some primary significance test; it just said you look at -- you don't have the common law per se bar against trademarking colors; it's just a factual question about what consumers think.
Do they find the mark useful? And so we -- we win under three provisions. I think the other problem, even putting aside those three provisions, Justice Thomas, is that there's a whole separate problem the government has, that there are two provisions that require courts to look to how consumers would view the mark as a whole and not its component parts. And so you can't just think because ""Wine Company"" -- ""wine"" is generic, ""company"" is generic, ""Wine Company"" is generic.
And that's the same, you know, with the word ""container"" and the word ""store."" You put the two together.
""Booking"" or "".com,"" you put the two together and you have to -- you have to look at the way consumers would view that as a whole. That also abrogates a per se rule. So you don't even need to mention primary significance to know that the government is wrong.
It just so happens that every court has always said the primary significance test governs. Yeah. The PTO's manual says it. It's the test that was applied in this case. And if I could turn to something that I think is pretty devastating for the government, is their appendix. Their appendix of rejected marks is not based on Goodyear.
It's based on the primary significance test.
Go look at the records in ad.com, bedandbreakfast.com, bookkeeping.com, limousine.com, newspaperarchive.com.
There's no Goodyear. It's the primary significance that looks at extensive evidentiary record about how consumers would perceive the mark. Now our appendix is not -- it's the same.
It's not based on mistakes.
Weather.com, tickets.com, dating.com, wrestlingfigures.com, and another bed and breakfast mark, the PTO looked at extensive evidence.
It wasn't some lazy PTO officer.
It was someone looking at the primary significance test and saw, wow, I'm seeing that consumers really see weather.com as distinctive, it deserves registration. So the status quo is the primary significance test.
And that's what has been -- you know, I think this also should give the Chief and Justice Thomas some comfort that most marks flunk the primary significance test, but some don't. So do you make a -- the government relies on Goodyear, and you say that, of course, there's been a sea change in trademark law since Goodyear, particularly with the Lanham Act. Would you just explain briefly how you think the Lanham Act has expanded the trademark law and what is protected and what is not protected? Sure, Justice Thomas.
So it's a basic overhaul in the sense that -- and, again, these are the five Supreme Court cases that are cited on pages 37 and 38 of our brief, and all the old chestnuts, Elgin and Canal Company, these are famous trademark cases that are all about the bar on descriptive marks. You cannot, could not, may not trademark Lackawanna Coal or Pennsylvania Wheat or Elgin Watch or whatever the typewriter was in the Howe case.
You just can't do it because everybody has an equal right to say they have that particular characteristic or that particular -- Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Justice Ginsburg? If you have the same name, Ms. Blatt, then the consumers will know that the word com, .com, will get you a particular thought, not all sellers of a given sort of commodity but one particular thought. And yet you don't argue that generic.com is always potentially trademarkable.
So when must a generic .com remain generic? So, in terms of when it flunks the primary significance test, in addition, I can talk -- I'll give you some examples, but the -- the cites that I gave you from the government appendix are good examples of how generic word .com marks flunk it.
But let's just -- let's look at -- well, there are several examples. So, in our survey, the majority, overwhelming majority found that washingmachines.com were generic, and yet an overwhelming majority found that Booking.com referred to the travel website that's used around the globe. Another example, just sort of a common sense example I can give you, is that sometimes people think of generic word .coms generically. I have searched every grocerystore.com looking for toilet paper.
I have now started looking at every hardware.com.
I am using fooddelivery.com for all of my takeouts these days.
Those are generic -- generic usages of a generic word .com. And I think the examples on the PTO's database versus our examples just show you where -- and let me just correct for the record here about survey evidence.
Survey evidence is never dispositive.
You always look at any and all relevant evidence about consumer usages. And if there's evidence from newspapers, consumer surveys, dictionaries, trade journals that give you reason to suspect a survey is either unreliable or just you don't have to credit it, then don't credit it.
Then the dot -- the generic .com mark loses as a factual matter because the evidence is over -- otherwise overwhelming that the mark flunks the primary significance test. It's just that, here, the government dropped -- it tried to argue the survey was unreliable, but it -- it waived that in the court of appeals.
And so we -- and the -- the district court said, I'm not just relying on the survey, I'm relying on all the evidence about Booking.com and the lack of PTO's evidence. But other cases will turn out differently. May I ask you another question? And that is, if passing off another service as your service is what you're really concerned about, why does an unfair competition law afford you adequate protection? So mainly the reason is because, you know, we're a business.
We want the same competitive rights that every other travel agency has to federal registration.
But, specifically, .com marks need Sections 1125(d) and (d)(2) in particular because it allows in rem proceedings. So, if you have a cyber scam, they largely arise overseas, and the person is beyond the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts, and what the Lanham Act does, if you're -- if you're a trademark, it allows you to sue the domain name and basically shut it down. And spoofing, typo -- typosquatting and all those other cyber -- cyber scams are prevalent on the Internet.
But I do think, even if you didn't have the Internet-specific reasons, they're not second-class citizens. They deserve the same trademark registration rights as any other company to protect against outright counterfeiting and infringement. Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer? Thank you.
I'm going to -- going to -- directing your attention to Professor Tushnet's brief and McCarthy on trademark, which is against your position, it's a combination of -- of four things. One, the trademark law is supposed to give the company the advantage that grows out of a commercial identification.
It's not supposed to create monopoly power or market power beyond that. Mm-hmm. Here, the power of the trademark, your trademark, is exactly growing out of the fact that everybody knows there's one com with one name.
And if you can do it in the future, you don't have to worry about searching the Internet for toilet paper from grocerystores.com.
There will only be one. Grocerystores.com will recognize one and only one.
There will be pizza.com, there will be cookies.com, there will be flowers.com, et cetera. Now, second, the problem is maybe not so bad if that was the only thing that they could use.
But there are going to be lawsuits when it's ipizza.com because that's Italian pizza, or fflowers.com because that's fresh flowers, or ebookings.com.
So we're creating an area of exclusivity that goes well beyond the name. The third thing they bring out is that, in fact, the identification that you talk about flows simply from the fact that loads of people now know that each Internet company has one name. So the interesting thing about your survey is not the 73 percent of the people who think that Booking.com is a single company but the 33 percent of the people who think that washingmachines.com is a -- is a -- is a trademark special company, which it isn't.
And they do that because they know about the Internet.
So you're taking Internet power, not just advertising or commercial product power, and multiplying it. And the fourth thing is what Justice Ginsburg said.
There's another way to achieve your result: unfair competition law. All right.
Now that's a lot.
But I want to hear your answer to those points. Sure.
It's not really a lot.
It's first there's the statute, that the statute decided the policy decision in our favor.
If we meet the definition of a trademark, we get registered. Second, as a policy matter, the Tushnet brief is just wrong.
If you look at the page 94 of the trial court record, read -- that was the government's expert's story, their narrative, the judge rejected it, and if you look at pages 164 and 167 of the Joint Appendix, our expert trashes that methodology and makes fun of it and says, if you -- okay, take out, go ahead, remove every single person who erroneously thought Washington -- washingmachines.com was a -- was a trademark, and you still get a 64 percent, which is huge brand recognition for Booking.com. Third, the government's appendix just destroys this argument.
They reject these marks day in and day out.
They don't get registered. Fourth, reality destroys their argument.
Where are the lawsuits? Where are the complaints? Nowhere.
I don't see any.
Our brief at pages 27 and 28 cites rent.com, tickets.com, and travel.com, and then sites like -- and I lost -- we just ran out of room to put them all.
123rent.com, rentusanow.com, forrent.com, it's endless. The notion that anyone is being crowded out is just silly.
It would be one thing if they could explain someone complaining. But the ubiquity of the travel marks and the ticket marks and the rent marks is nuts. And so this -- Thank you, counsel. Sure. Justice Alito? What would your client's position be if companies that had -- that took Booking.com but made very slight variations sought trademark protection? Yeah, that's -- that's fine.
And that's why ebooking -- we don't object to ebooking. ebooking is not a problem. And I think it's for the two reasons -- if I could finish -- it is what -- exactly what Justice Gorsuch said. It is the fair use defense allows under Section 1115(b)(4) that anyone can use the registered name -- here, it would be Booking or Booking.com -- to describe their services, no -- no liability. And also -- and McCarthy has a huge -- a huge thing on this, that the more descriptive the names, these lawsuits just don't -- don't work.
And that's true with the -- it's not just .com marks.
Alzheimer's has a foundation. You would not -- your client would not object to the registration of any trademark that simply made a slight variation in Booking.com? That would be fine? All of those companies could register their trademarks? They are, because there's a million booking registrations already. Yeah.
Would you just answer the question? Yes.
They -- Would your client object to that? They don't and have not and would not.
Now, if there was fraud and somebody ripping off the goodwill based on Booking.com, I'm sure they'd want to sue, but it -- it would be very hard to bring that lawsuit. Very hard. My concern with your position is exactly what I think Justice Breyer just suggested.
You are seeking a degree of monopoly power that nobody could have had prior to the Internet age. I take it a company could not have registered ""booking company,"" but because of the Internet, you have Booking.com, which gives you an advantage over other companies that are in that business.
And now you want to get even more advantage by getting trademark protection for that. So if I could turn to the company situation.
This is just not true.
The Wig Company, which is registered, is celebrating its 50th year anniversary.
It's called The Wig Company.
There's also The Wig Shop and The Wig Store and The Wig -- Wig Mart. And so it's not like Wig Company has crowded out wig companies.
There are many places that sell wigs just fine.
It's not like any generic word .com has crowded out -- weather.com exists with accuweather.com. Law.com, there are so many law.com variations that are registered and not suing each other and no one's complaining that you just type in law.com into the database and you'll see it. There's just a lot of registered names. And that's fine in terms of saying, well, that's just, you know, what the PTO does, but the fact that -- that they don't have any anticompetitive harm seems to me telling that you wouldn't want to -- you wouldn't want to write an opinion destroying the -- the -- the billions of dollars of goodwill that's been built up in not just .com marks but in company marks. And if you extend Goodyear past corporate designation, it just -- the government cited it.
It said ""company"" means an association or a partnership.
Well, .com is not an association or a partnership.
It's a store to buy stuff.
And so -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Ms. Blatt, I am troubled, as Justice Breyer and Justice Alito are, about the monopoly situation, but I'm also troubled by what's the rule that you want the PTO to follow? They can't trademark under law generic names.
Are they required now to run their own consumer perception surveys before they determine that a particular name is generic? How -- are you okay with the existing rule that I think Justice Kagan read before, which is that there is no per se rule but that -- what is it -- how is it going to change PTO practice, and won't it lead inevitably to the registration of every single common name of every business and then a expensive legal fight on whether it's become generic or not? So I -- I 100 percent agree with Justice Kagan.
It -- our view is the status quo, which is the primary significance test, it's what the PTO's manual says.
It's what the PTO has been applying, which is why our -- our appendix and the government's appendix are actually consistent. It shows the PTO day in and day out rolling up its sleeves applying the primary significance test.
No, you do not have to have a survey.
The PTO looks at tons of evidence and says, look, this is just -- consumers would see this as referring to any place on the Internet that sells these goods.
You're not getting registered.
And that's the end of the story. And that's why a lot of those marks end up on the rejected list. Now, on our list, when they let in weather.com, they looked at different evidence and said, wow, weather.com has a big consumer fan base and has -- has the primary significance of being a brand.
So we got to register that. And that's good for consumers. You want consumers to know when they go to weather.com they're getting weather.com and not accuweather.com, and the same way with the dating.com and wrestlingfigures.com. So I -- I hear you on you're worried, but the PTO is up to the task.
This is what they've been doing.
And we've had -- there are .com marks that have been registered from the late 1990s and 2000s without incident. If this is a -- if this is a factual question, and a district court is not to give the PTO deference, then what we're going to have is every district court reweighing all of this evidence that the PTO looked at. And, frankly, I'm on the margin with respect to your mark, because I would have looked at ebooking and carbooking and hotelbooking and all of those other bookings and said this really booking standing alone is generic, even with .com. Now you point to the Teflon study, but you seem to be saying that a district court who ruled a different way would be wrong as a matter of law.
Could that be? No.
That -- Could any survey ever be dispositive? No.
So let me be clear. A district court -- and it sounds like we would have lost had you been the trial court -- could rule against us -- (Laughter.) -- based on the survey. Maybe, maybe not. I didn't look at that entire record. No, but you could.
We could have lost at the trial court level. That's the risk you take.
A lot of people go the Federal Circuit route because they like Federal Circuit law and you take a risk.
You go usually the district court route when you think you have good evidence. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan? Good morning, Ms. Blatt.
I guess what strikes me is -- is something along the same lines as what has struck Justices Breyer and Alito and Sotomayor, and it's that there seems a disconnect between the primary significance test and these kinds of names, because the primary significance test is really asking, well, does a consumer understand something as referring to a category of products or, instead, as referring to a particular product or service? And -- and these names by definition are unique, and everybody knows that they're unique. So, if you apply the primary significance test to these completely unique URLs, aren't you going to get a bias in the results? Correct. And it's true of the -- the survey, the Teflon surveys, but it's true of evidence generally, that it would seem as if you're going to get a bias in the results and more things will seem to be registrable than really ought to be. Yeah, so a great question, and I think I can clarify this for you. So, just like The Wig Company or wig.com, they can be generic for wig companies and wig producers.
So it's not just you have to say The Wig Company.
No one thinks The Wig Company is referring to wigs.
It would be -- or, you know, it would be generic for a type of company.
So it's not just a category of goods. It's the category of the sellers. So, if you think of Booking.com is no different than the Container Store, you could say that is so unfair that Container Store -- the Container Store, because there can only be one The Container Store.
It's the same way with .com. Now you're right about the -- the Internet address, but that would indict every .com mark, even your hotel, Paris -- Paris hotel booking, because you would always win under the -- under the sphere of it must have -- it could never be generic. And so courts have just been dealing with this, I'd say now for two decades, or at least the PTO, that were treating the .com marks like house marks, store marks, association marks -- Okay.
Let me ask you another question that goes back to what Justice Alito said.
And you said to him and to the Chief Justice, well, you wouldn't sue ebookings.com or hotelbookings.com or any of a number of variants on the name. Who would you sue? When is a .com going to win a trademark suit? I haven't seen any.
The same reason though -- but let me just be clear, the same reason the Alzheimer's associations and paper stores and the paper marts aren't all suing each other, because they'd lose.
So these suits don't happen. But why people want trademark registration is twofold.
Outright counterfeiting, because Booking.com is a -- is a popular name, and we don't want people ripping off or a store opening up. I think if you read the car.com brief, they show car dealers putting up signs calling themselves car.com.
That's called ripping off. That's called theft.
And that's what the trademark laws are about.
So you need that. But, secondly, I think that they want it for the -- 1125(d).
It's a specific problem with spoofing and cyber -- and cyber scams.
And that is definitely what the Internet amicus briefs are saying, is that they need this.
And that's what Booking cares about.
Booking does not like Internet scams and cyber scams stealing its business and ruining its reputation because, you know, someone infects your Internet and destroys your -- you know, your identity. Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Good morning.
If I understand your point correctly, Ms. Blatt, it's that the government's concerns about the competitive advantage are minimized or mitigated by the fact that marks like Booking.com are relatively weak because you're putting together two generic terms. And consumers may well have your company in mind when they see that.
You've got evidence -- and we can argue about how good that is -- but there may be no consumer confusion. And that may also be true with ebooking or hotelbooking.
Consumers may or may not, depending on the facts, have particular companies in mind. And the relative weakness of the mark is your answer, together with the fair use doctrine, to the government's monopoly concerns. Is that a fair summary? Much better than I said. Will you expound on that, please? Sure.
So -- and let me just help you with the reason why they're so weak to begin with and why McCarthy has this whole chapter of every lawsuit where, you know, similarly worded marks can't sue for others. Let's take weather.com and accuweather.com.
So it turns out that consumers -- when you have very descriptive marks like both of those that are registered, consumers become very conditioned to focus on the difference.
So they know ""accu"" is different.
If you look at booking and ebooking, consumers would focus on, oh, there's the ""e"" site, there's the ""e"" one, I want to go to the ""e"" one. And so it is very, very hard to show likelihood of confusion because the more similar the mark is, it becomes extremely impossible or exceedingly unlikely to be able to prove that. And that is not specific to the "".com"" context. It's the same problem that every mart, shop, source, place, exchange, emporium, collective -- you know, we have -- like there's a million dog marks, a million coffee marks, a million paper mart -- paper marks.
They all have different -- ""store,"" ""shop,"" ""place."" Very similarly worded.
They never sue each other, and if they do, they lose. Do you -- And I'm not making it up, Justice Gorsuch.
They had a whole brief to cite examples of lawsuits. Can you address for me a little bit more on the record, I know we're not the trial judge here, but Justice Breyer's point, I think, 74 percent of consumers recognized Booking.com as your client, but 33 percent think that anything "".com"" is a -- is a real store. So only about -- as -- as I understand it, about 41 percent on a net basis recognize your mark.
What -- what do we do about that? What -- what should we say in this opinion, if anything -- Well -- -- about the standard -- Yes.
So -- -- if not the facts? Okay.
So you've read the Tushnet brief and the government's brief.
You have not obviously read our expert -- Well, now -- -- that explains how -- -- that's not fair. Now come on. Okay.
So why it is so funny is that you would never net them out.
You don't take 74 and subtract 33.
It's just based on a -- like, a very sort of lack of understanding of survey methodologies. You net out the participants.
And so, when you net out the participants, you say Lisa Blatt dumbly thought washington. -- washing -- washingmachine.com was a -- was a -- was a brand, so we're going to take her out of the survey.
So, if we look at the people who correctly saw washingmachine.com as generic, 64 percent still saw Booking.com. And so I guess I can say is there's just -- there's an extensive discussion of this in the -- Oh, I -- I understand that.
I'm -- I'm trying to extract just a level up from the facts -- Okay.
Okay.
I'll -- -- and ask for your guidance as to what the Court should say with respect to these kind of survey methodologies, if anything. So I think -- Briefly, Ms. Blatt.
Ms. Blatt? Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
So what I would say is that, you know, the survey is -- the survey instructs the consumers -- I'm sorry, the participants ahead of time that ""office supplies"" is a common -- ""officesupplies.com"" is generic.
And if they didn't understand that, they couldn't take the survey, that staples.com was a brand and officesupplies.com is generic.
If the -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Blatt.
I want to make sure I understand what you think about our precedent in Goodyear exactly. Could the principle of Goodyear still have some value outside the "".com"" context in the classic company context in which that case arose because the "".coms"" are inherently unique, or is your position more broadly that Goodyear just has no value anymore? So I'll -- I'll fall back to certainly you shouldn't extend it to "".com"" because "".com"" is closer to the words ""store"" and ""shop"" -- and ""shop."" But, if you took Goodyear at its word, you're killing non-profits because of the association problem. Goodyear -- the terms of the opinion say it means association.
And that's how non-profits identify themselves.
So we have -- or a coalition or a society.
And so you have the Amputee Coalition, the Christian Coalition. You have -- there are so many of these associational marks that I think Goodyear would destroy, in addition to ""foods co."" or ""Container Store."" And I -- I just want to say one thing about the government's making fun of the Cheesecake Factory.
""Crab House"" is not a little house where crabs live.
They're actually dead and you eat them.
And the government thought ""Crab House"" was generic. So, if you go down this road of thinking that certain words are off limits, I just think you're creating a real mess that's very unstable, unprincipled, and unworkable and unclear. Picking up on Justice Kagan's line of questioning, it seems that your rule invariably will lead to a situation where most every "".com"" business that sells good or -- goods or services will be able to obtain a trademark.
Maybe -- in other words, your position leads to the opposite kind of bright-line rule.
Maybe that's okay, but is that wrong and, if so, when -- when wouldn't it be? I think it's wrong, but I -- I hear that -- I hear at least six of you concerned about it, so I can try to help on -- on this. What you can do is make clear in your opinion that a district court, if there is evidence of -- from all kinds of sources that the PTO uses and all those examples I gave in the beginning, they cite all kinds of examples proving that generic word "".com"" marks flunk the primary significance test -- that the PTO can look past survey evidence and so can courts if you're really worried about a survey bias. Now we have a whole brief of survey experts saying this was a great survey.
So I -- I hate to trash our survey.
A lot of people thought our survey was great.
It's the -- it's the classic Teflon survey. But, also, let me just take you to Waffle House.
Waffle House, there was a fight about the survey.
The -- the PTO said it was generic, and Waffle House came in with a survey and they -- they trademarked it.
So I -- I don't know why "".com"" is having some sort of, you know -- it's scary and, therefore, it should be treated differently because of this fear that all "".com"" marks have an unfair advantage because of a website.
It's -- you know, the PTO has been doing this for -- for two decades now without a problem. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross, you have three minutes for rebuttal.
Ms. Ross, three minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Sorry about that. The -- if I could just focus on three main points.
First, I think Respondent's rule operates from the presumption that the Lanham Act knocked out all prior common law unless it was expressly preserved.
That's the opposite of the way that we usually think about statutory change.
I think just a couple of weeks ago in Romag, this Court, nine justices, looked to the common law to determine what the Lanham Act preserved.
And I think the same should be true here.
That's particularly so because, in the examples that Respondent cites, like the geographic terms and descriptive terms, Congress was clear when it wanted to overturn pre-Lanham Act precedent. I think, on the second point, Respondent suggests that the primary significance test did it.
In particular, I think I heard my friend just suggest for the first time today that Kellogg itself did it. That's inconsistent with the position that they take on page 22 of their brief, which acknowledges that Kellogg actually discussed the primary significance test to determine when a descriptive term would get protection under unfair competition law, so that's entirely consistent with the view here that generic terms are never susceptible to trademark, even with primary -- even -- or even when a showing of secondary meaning has been made. Again, we think that the primary significance test coexists with prior law, which includes Goodyear.
And I think Respondent points to this idea that the PTO has been applying the primary significance test.
That's true with the Goodyear sort of guardrail.
It understands that a generic term can't be made into a trademark simply by showing that a bunch of consumers think that it -- it's associated with a particular mark or a particular brand. Now Respondent's example actually -- or Respondent's survey actually proves this point.
There was a lot of back and forth about washing -- ""washingmachine.com"" versus ""Booking.com,"" but I think what's really instructive here is ""washingmachine.com"" versus ""supermarket."" Thirty-three percent of Respondents in Respondent's survey thought that ""washingmachine.com"" was a brand name.
Zero, not a single survey respondent, thought that ""supermarket"" had that -- that characteristic. So, clearly, the .com context is doing a ton of work on Respondent's view. The third point that Respondent really hit was this idea that there wouldn't be any competitive harm from Respondent's rule.
I think that's clearly not correct. We know that because of the same reason that we know that booking companies shouldn't be allowed to be trademarked.
We just know that when you have -- that a trademark law is not supposed to take terms off the table, that everyone needs to describe their goods. I think, you know, Respondent focused on certain examples, like ""tickets.com"" and ""Container Store."" I think, again, Respondent is misunderstanding that you have to always look at how -- what those are registered for.
So ""tickets.com,"" for example, for ticket management services, not for tickets generally. So they're massively overstating what's going on here. I think, again, there might be hard questions at the margins on some of these, whether something like ""container"" or ""tickets"" is being used in its generic sense, but that's not reflective of the .com or the company. That's at that first root level. Finally, I think, if they're not going to sue ebooking.com and hotelbooking.com, it's really unclear what they want out of this. Ripping off Respondent referred to is covered by unfair competition.
Typosquatting likewise is covered by unfair competition.
And Section 1125(d), which Respondent pointed to, presumes that you have a preexisting trademark like Kodak or like Xerox or like Teflon in the old days, and someone goes along and -- Thank you, counsel. -- gets the trademark -- Thank you, counsel.

"This morning we will hear argument in Case 19-177, United States Agency for International Development versus the Alliance for Open Society International.
I note at the outset that Justice Kagan is recused in this case. Mr. Michel. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Twenty years ago, the HIV/AIDS pandemic was devastating the world.
In response, President Bush proposed and Congress adopted the Leadership Act.
Since reauthorized three times, the Act has committed nearly 80 billion dollars to global AIDS relief, and it has worked, saving more than 17 million lives in the most successful American foreign aid effort since the Marshall Plan. The funding condition at issue here requires recipients to have a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, which Congress found are coercive practices that spread HIV/AIDS and degrade women and girls.
This Court held that applying that condition to Respondents' domestic entities violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.
But Respondents sought more, and the question now is whether the condition can still be applied to foreign grant recipients operating abroad. It can for two straightforward reasons.
Foreign entities lack constitutional rights, so they cannot bring an unconstitutional conditions claim, and neither can Respondents because they are not subject to the funding condition.
Thanks to their victory in this Court, Respondents can accept and use funds without any compelled speech.
To be sure, Respondents can choose to affiliate with foreign entities that must comply with the policy condition, but any effect on Respondents' message is now a product of their own choice, not government compulsion. Respondents' contrary view is startling.
They would allow U.S. non-profits to export constitutional rights to legally separate foreign entities abroad simply because they share similar brands.
That novel theory has no basis in this Court's prior decision, it could undermine long-standing regulations of foreign speech, and it has no practical justification. For 17 years, foreign recipients have adhered to the policy condition without harming the AIDS relief program or Respondents' speech. This Court afforded Respondents all the relief they deserve.
The decision below should be reversed. Counsel, one thing that I think is not clear from the record is the precise relationship between the domestic entity and its foreign affiliates.
We -- we know that there are no formal corporate ties but that these entities share the same name, the same logo, the same brand. What -- what would you require beyond that before attributing the speech of the foreign entity to the domestic one? Mr. Chief Justice, you're correct that the record is not particularly thorough on that issue, despite 15 years of litigation on -- on this matter.
The district court ultimately entered the injunction it issued here based simply on -- on letter briefing. But our position is that the formal distinction between the two entities, the -- the U.S. entity and the foreign entity, is all that is required to attach separate legal rights. Of course, it's important to note the Respondents and the foreign entities that they claim as affiliates made the choice to be separate legal entities.
That choice, of course, has certain benefits for them, such as shielding them from liability, but it also has -- Is it -- -- certain perks. -- is it reasonable to insist on formal corporate ties in this -- in this context? I gather that it's undisputed that to be effective in many of the foreign countries involved here, you have to operate through a foreign entity, that the -- the effort would not be as effective if the American entity were the one actually on the ground in the foreign country. Well, two points on that, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, I think that that is not true as a uniform matter.
Many of the Respondents, the U.S. entities do, in fact, operate in foreign countries through branch offices, and, as a result of this Court's prior decision, they always have a choice to operate in that way without compromising their speech in any way.
They are, in other words, completely in charge of their own message while also accepting Leadership Act funds. And -- and to take your second point, if they make the choice to operate through a foreign entity because they decide that that is more convenient or more effective, they have to accept the bitter with the sweet, to be sure, operating through a distinct legal entity, but they're not without recourse.
They can, for example, explain that the policy statement being issued by the foreign entity doesn't reflect their own views. Their free speech allows them to do that.
And I -- and I would note as -- But, presumably -- presumably, it does reflect their own views.
You know, they have the same name, the same logo, the same brand. And I wonder if it makes more sense to think of the foreign entity as simply another channel for the domestic entity's speech. Mr. Chief Justice, with respect, I don't -- I don't think it does.
And I think, you know, when that was the only option available, as it was in the Court's decision last time, I can understand, of course, why the Court decided the case the way it did. But now that Respondents have a separate choice, in fact, the very choice that they were fighting for last time, any consequences of the choice to operate as separate entities is a result of their own decisions. And -- and I -- I -- Thank you -- -- wanted to note -- -- thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Mr. Michel, the Respondent seems to argue that your guidelines on -- your affiliate guidelines actually support their argument.
What do you think of that? Justice Thomas, I -- I don't think that they do as -- as an initial matter and, even if they did, I think that would, at most, be a basis for challenging the guidelines, not -- not the constitutionality of the statute. And to start with the first point, the guidelines, which are reproduced at -- at pages 1A through 3A of our reply brief, simply provide that an entity can affiliate with a separate entity that has a different policy on prostitution and sex trafficking if it meets certain requirements, and -- and there are five non-exhaustive requirements spelled out there. Four of those would generally be satisfied by an entity that has legal separation.
So I think it would be a rare circumstance that these regulations would ever result in the denial of funding to a foreign affiliate. And -- and to make one related point, Respondents themselves are no longer subject to the policy requirement as a result of their prior decision in this case.
So, if they run afoul of these regulations, which simply interpret what it means to have a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, these regulations can't be a mechanism for depriving the Respondents themselves of funds. When this case was here last, I seem to remember it was about the domestic organization.
The -- what has changed since it was here? The -- there was very little talk. The only time that affiliates actually came up was as an alternative to the enforcement procedures that were being used toward the domestic organizations then. So what has changed since this case was here last? Well, Justice Thomas, you're exactly right.
That was all that was at issue last time.
And the only thing that has changed is that Respondents have asked for broader relief. And although, you know, we fully accept the Court's prior decision, we -- we -- we submit that Respondents are simply not entitled to any further relief. As you suggest, there's nothing in this Court's decision that contemplates or suggests applying the -- the prohibition on applying the policy requirement to foreign entities overseas, so I think the Court ought to simply analyze the claim under first principles. And, as I said at the outset, I think two simple principles resolve the case. Respondents themselves are not subject to a funding condition, so they can't have an unconstitutional conditions claim, and the foreign entities that are subject to the funding condition have no constitutional rights, so they can't have an unconstitutional condition claim either. We do think that what Respondents are asking for is -- is unjustifiably bootstrapping this Court's prior decision into global relief, and we simply don't think there's any basis for that. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg? Mr. Michel, I have two questions.
The first is that the statute exempts certain non-domestic entities from the requirement to adopt an anti-prostitution policy, and those are the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health Organization, International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, and any U.N. agency. What is the reason for the exemption? Why are these organizations exempt and not the organizations at issue here? Justice Ginsburg, I think there are a few reasons for that.
Those are in the main international organizations that are composed of their own separate sovereigns, and so I think it makes sense that Congress would have wanted to respect the sovereignty of the members of those organizations in a way that doesn't, of course, apply to non-profit organizations receiving funds at issue here. The -- the vaccine organization that you mentioned as well seems to be particularly unlikely to -- to bring into play the considerations that motivated Congress to require the anti-prostitution and sex trafficking pledge because they're not operating in the field.
They're simply doing research on -- on vaccines.
But I don't take -- It -- it seems to me that these organizations are doing the same thing. But let me ask you my second question, and it is: May a pledge taker -- say you're right and these foreign entities have to take the pledge -- may they nonetheless work with prostitutes to encourage the prostitutes to take preventative measures that will advance control of AIDS? The answer to that question -- Can they do that? Can they take -- they say, all right, we'll take the pledge, but we're going to work with prostitutes, make sure that they use preventative devices? Absolutely they can, Justice Ginsburg, and we encourage that.
That goes back to a point I was going to make earlier, which is the -- the pledge that's required by the statute only requires one affirmative speech act, and that is submitting to USAID with the grant agreement a -- a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. But there's no requirement that foreign entities that make that -- that make that pledge shout it from the mountaintops or get into anybody's face about it.
They are completely free to, and encouraged to, work with prostitutes and victims of sex trafficking to prevent HIV/AIDS. And -- and, indeed, you know, one of the reasons for including this requirement in the statute and many other provisions of the statute dealing with prostitution and sex trafficking is that Congress recognized that women who -- who are often coerced into those practices are themselves at heightened risks of contracting the disease, of spreading the disease, and -- and, of course, of -- of losing other opportunities in their lives. So we certainly encourage groups to do that kind of work, and it's not at all in tension with the -- with the policy requirement. I would also note the -- the amicus brief filed in this Court's case last time by the Coalition Against Trafficking at Women, which made the point that many prostitutes and victims of sex trafficking are themselves opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking and so wouldn't take offense at the statement that the groups have to make. Thank you, counsel. But in any event -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer? Just following up on that question, some would.
Some would take offense.
And it's -- in the last case, you said that this -- we said, this Court said, this organization, which takes money from the government and uses it to fight AIDS, goes to prostitutes as part of their effort and says use safety.
And that's one way of helping to fight And if at the same time they have to say, we're against prostitution, we don't like it, we're against it, it's terrible, well, the prostitutes will think they're hypocrites or maybe worse and will be suspicious.
That was their reasoning last time. Now how does that change one iota in terms of their rights, which we said they had, the major organizations in the United States have, the right to do, how does that change one iota if, instead of sending their own worker there, they give the money to a foreign worker in India who is associated with them and that foreign worker goes and she says exactly the same thing to the prostitutes? Since the foreign workers are identified by name, mission, logo, with the domestic workers, how does it interfere one whit less if we accept your argument? They will be seen, domestic, as well as the foreign ones, as hypocrites or, worse, interfering with their mission.
If we accepted that argument before, why don't we accept it now? Well, a couple of quick responses, Justice Breyer. I -- I don't think that the Court did base its prior decision on that particular concern.
I think it based its decision on the First Amendment rights of the U.S. entities that were receiving the funds. And so the principal difference between the case last time and the case this time is not that the entities are interacting in -- with prostitutes in any different manner. It's that the entities that are now subject to the funding condition lack constitutional rights under deeply established -- you know, the deeply established principle that foreign entities abroad don't exercise constitutional rights and, therefore, can be subject to greater speech restrictions than U.S. entities at home. Now I do want to reiterate that I think the concerns you have raised, while legitimate, are -- are -- are not borne out in practice because the policy requirement, whether applied in the past to domestic groups or now to foreign groups, does not require them to tell prostitutes that they oppose prostitution or to do anything affirmative beyond agreeing to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking in the letter. And we're fortunate to have a 17-year track record to look at here.
The foreign entities have, from the very beginning and even recently under stays of the -- of the district court's injunction in this phase of the litigation, been subject to the policy requirement throughout that period.
And as Judge Straub noted in his dissent below, they have not identified even one example of -- of anybody perceiving hypocrisy in their message or of -- of setting back their -- their work to fight HIV/AIDS, which, of course, has been historically effective. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito? Counsel, as I understand the government's position, it depends on whether the foreign entity that ultimately gets the legal -- the Leadership Act funds is a separate legal entity or legally distinct from the U.S. entity.
Is that correct? Yeah, it depends -- what we look at is whether the recipient of the funds, the entity subject to the condition, has First Amendment rights or not, and we think that turns on whether they're a U.S. entity or a foreign entity. All right.
So what do you understand to be the meaning of ""legally separate"" or ""legally distinct""? And how would that apply where the U.S. entity is a non-profit corporation, a trust, or an unincorporated association, if there are any of those, and in the situation where the foreign entity is organized in one of those ways? So the sort of difficult questions about how -- how to parse incorporation have really not arisen in this case because I think Respondents and the foreign entities at issue are clearly legally separate in the way that matters for the funding program, which is to say they've applied separately for different grants. And so the easiest way to answer the question, I think, is that when a U.S. entity applies for a grant as its own entity, it's not subject to the policy requirement.
When a foreign entity applies for a separate grant, distinct from any affiliation it might have with a U.S. entity, then it is subject to the policy requirement.
And the foreign -- So the U.S. entity gets the money and the U.S. entity wants to make a sub-grant to a foreign entity, and as I understood your -- your position, whether or not the foreign entity can be required to endorse the policy depends on whether it's legally distinct from the U.S. entity.
Is that correct? That -- that is correct. So, in that sub-grant relationship, the condition would then attach to the foreign entity as the sub-grantee of the U.S. entity. All right.
Well, so, if the U.S. entity is a trust, what -- what -- what -- how would we determine what is legally separate from -- what foreign entity is legally separate from a trust, a U.S. trust? I have to confess, Justice Alito, we haven't confronted the trust question, so -- so I don't have a ready answer for that.
I -- I think that in the 17-year history of the program, though, that there really hasn't been any difficulty in telling apart foreign -- foreign organizations from -- from domestic organizations. You know, we're happy to take a further look at the -- at the trust hypothetical, but it's one that just hasn't arisen. Well, is that because, until recently, the government's test was not legal separation -- was not whether it was a legally separate entity but a multifactor test under the regulation to which Justice Thomas referred? No, with respect, Justice Alito, that -- that's not and -- and hasn't been our position.
From -- from the outset, the government has applied the policy requirement to foreign entities abroad, and it turns out, as a result of -- of injunctions, for almost that entire period, the government has not applied the policy requirement to -- to domestic entities.
The regulations -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Justice Sotomayor? I'm sorry, Chief. Did it again. Mr. Michel, the long and the short of this is that a domestic agency that does not want to adopt a policy of being opposed to abortion but who is willing to not support it in a program, they can't receive funds unless they affiliate with someone who will make the statement for them, correct? I -- I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor.
A U.S. entity that opposes prostitution and sex trafficking, which is the only requirement at issue in this case, can still receive funds as a result of this Court's prior decision, and they can use those funds abroad without contracting or -- or otherwise working through affiliates. But the domestic corporation who doesn't want to speak the government's message but does want to do the program can't, unless it finds a affiliate who will speak the government's message? Well, with respect, Justice Sotomayor, that -- I think that was the issue in the case last time.
But -- Exactly. -- that's no longer true. Yeah. Exactly.
And the last time when you sought for cert before us, you said it was a facial -- it was tantamount or amounting to a facial challenge.
If we read our prior decision as basically facially addressing the restriction, do you win? I think if you read it as truly facially invalidating the statute, then, no, we couldn't win.
But for the reason -- All right.
Then I move on to another question. Of course. In Hobby Lobby, we recognized that a closely held corporation at least could be viewed as expressing the religious beliefs of its owner, a person independent legally.
In Hurley, we said that parade organizers could be identified by the people who marched in their parade.
And, similarly, in Regan, we said that an entity could speak through an affiliate who would be recognized as itself because it could then do lobbying that Regan couldn't do under the government program. So these cases seem to suggest to me that at least in the First Amendment context, let's put aside any other context, but in the First Amendment context, we are less concerned with corporate formalities than we are with imputation or perception.
And to the extent that these corporations are closely affiliated, and presuming -- I know you said before that you don't think there's enough in the record; we can deal with that separately -- but presuming that the public does perceive these entities as one, then why wouldn't the First Amendment apply to the inability of the domestic corporations to receive funds and partner with a closely affiliated foreign entity in implementing the program? Justice Sotomayor, a couple of points.
I think Hurley and some of the other cases you cited all depend on the predicate of a forced affiliation between -- between the two groups.
In Hurley, it was the parade organizers and -- and the group that wanted to join the parade. Here, however -- and this is a response, I think, to the last part of your question -- no one is forcing the domestic entity to affiliate with a foreign entity.
The domestic entity has a choice to take the money and use it itself, and any hypocrisy or disturbance to its message that results is a result of its own choice to affiliate with a group that -- a foreign entity that accepts Leadership Act funds and must make the statement. So they're simply not being forced to affiliate with anyone in the way that was at issue in those cases you cited. Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, I'd like to just follow up on that for a moment.
You -- you seem to rely pretty heavily on legal separation. But the First Amendment, it's not clear to me why that -- that -- that cares, as opposed to imputation and in Hurley, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out. Can you speak to that a little bit further for me, please? Sure.
I think that the critical point, as -- as I said to file -- the reason to file a corporate separation here is that that's how the grant program is organized. And -- and this Court, you're right in Hurley where there was a forced -- a forced association, the Court held that attribution matters.
But, in every one of the Court's funding condition cases, the Court has looked to the effect on the recipient of the funds itself. And, here, Respondents and the foreign entities are making a conscious choice to apply for separate grants as separate entities and to be subject to separate conditions. I think the argument is a little -- goes a little bit beyond the forced nature of -- of the association to the concern about chilling of speech. Can you speak to that? The First Amendment doesn't care just about protecting speech.
It also is concerned about avoiding chilling of speech. I think that -- I think you're -- you're, of course, right about that, but I simply don't see any chilling of speech here, given that, as a result of this Court's prior decision, the domestic entities are free to take the money and -- and use it themselves in charge of their own message. And they're also free to make a different choice, which is to work through a foreign affiliate that, as a result of Respondents' own choice, will have to make the policy statement opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. But, even in that instance, Respondents are still free to use their own speech rights to explain that -- that they don't share the views of the foreign affiliate on prostitution and sex trafficking. I -- I think, ultimately, what Respondents are asking for is a sort of right to optimal message management, which is simply not what the First Amendment protects. If you look at cases like Rumsfeld versus FAIR, the Court explained that the law schools in that case might well be concerned about misattribution of their position on -- on letting military recruiters onto campus, and yet that concern alone was not a reason to find an unconstitutional conditions violation. And -- and likewise, in the Court's other funding cases, like Rust, for example, and Regan, the entities were ultimately not allowed to operate in their preferred manner.
The -- the abortion providers, for instance, in Rust, you know, certainly didn't want to have to separate their speech in the way that they did, but the Court found that it was constitutionally permissible for Congress and -- and the Executive Branch to require them to separate that speech because they still had an open channel to express their First Amendment views. And after this Court's prior decision, Respondents clearly have an open channel to -- to express their views without chilling and without having to give up the money. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Michel.
I'm interested in the implications of our decision in this case.
In particular, if the government were to lose this case, would any other programs or statutes be invalidated or called into question by such a decision? Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I think that there would be real concerns about that.
Of course, I'm not here to give up any other statutes, but I do think the gravamen of Respondents' position is that they and their foreign entities that they've chosen to keep separate should somehow be treated as some kind of single global unified entity. And if that is the theory that they're operating under, I do think it would call into question a number of different statutory and administrative regulations of foreign speech that like -- that likely couldn't be applied domestically. For example, Congress has long banned campaign contributions in U.S. elections by foreign entities.
But Congress, of course, could not ban such contributions by U.S. entities. Yet, if a U.S. entity were able to say that it shares or confers on a foreign affiliate its First Amendment rights, it might well claim a basis for challenging the -- that ban on -- on foreign speech.
And -- and there are many other examples that we cite in our brief as well. It's, in fact, commonplace for Congress and the Executive Branch to condition foreign aid to entities abroad on certain policy objectives, such as opposing terrorism or supporting women's rights or opposing apartheid or, in the case of the Mexico City policy, taking certain positions on abortion. And those content-based/ viewpoint-based speech restrictions might not be permissible in the United States.
And domestic entities who were able to confer or -- or, you know, unite with their foreign bodies, with foreign entities to challenge those, would, I think, create considerable risk of disturbing long-settled -- long-settled laws. One other question.
Has the program with respect to U.S. domestic organizations suffered any problems or been any less successful since this Court's decision in 2013 as far as you're aware? Not at all.
The program, with respect to both domestic and foreign recipients of funds, has, as I said at the outset, truly been one of the historic successes in -- you know, in the history of U.S. foreign aid. And I think, you know, we do have sort of the controlled experiment over the last 15 years as a result of injunctions in the first case and stays of the injunction in this case that the current status quo, whereby U.S. entities are not subject to the policy requirement, but foreign entities are subject to the policy requirement, has been the background law in place for about 15 years. And that has neither set back the extraordinary success of the program, nor created, as Judge Straub noted in his -- in his powerful dissent, any actual evidence of hypocrisy or confusion of message for Respondents themselves. Mr. Michel, take a minute to wrap up, please. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I do think this case ultimately in -- in its current iteration can be resolved on -- on a straightforward basis that Respondents themselves long accepted, and that's that the policy condition is a permissible exercise of Congress's core spending power as applied to foreign recipients that lack First Amendment rights but not as to domestic recipients that have First Amendment rights. And although Respondents have -- have broadened their position, they had it right the first time, and nothing supports the bootstrapping that they have requested. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bowker. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The undisputed record shows that the U.S. Respondents themselves suffer First Amendment harms when the policy requirement is imposed on their foreign affiliate. Respondents and their affiliates share a name, brand, logo, mission, and voice.
They speak as one, make speech and policy decisions together, and are indistinguishable to the public. As a result, the First Amendment rights of U.S. Respondents are violated here in two ways: first by a speech compulsion that is attributed to them.
When CARE in Kenya takes the pledge, its affirmation of belief is attributed to CARE in the United States, thus putting words in the mouth of the U.S. entity. The second violation is from a speech restriction.
Under regulations that prohibit any CARE entity from contradicting the pledge, even on its own time and dime, thus making it impossible for CARE U.S. to disavow CARE Kenya's pledge without engaging in doublespeak and losing U.S. funding for its global network. The government says the burden is on Respondents to avoid such harm by applying for funding themselves, severing their connections to affiliates, or disavowing the pledge.
But this has it backward. When a statute violates the First Amendment, the burden is on the government, not the speaker, to give First Amendment freedoms the necessary breathing space.
Plus, the government's proposals all fail in practice. Asking Respondents to apply for funds ignores that they must work through local affiliates in places where local laws or the U.S. government's own funding criteria require it. Severing ties with affiliates would destroy their organization.
Posing such a choice demonstrates how the government continues to use its vast spending power to coerce Respondents' fealty. Disclaimers also fail because, as this Court recognized in 2013, U.S. Respondents cannot credibly disavow the speech of their own clearly identified affiliates. The injunction affords Respondents complete relief from these violations and should be upheld. Counsel, can your client compel what the foreign affiliates say on this question? We represent several different organizations here, as Your Honor knows, and I think it is correct as a factual matter that in every case, the U.S. organization effectively can veto the speech of a foreign organization on these issues.
They do speak together.
They make their speech choices together.
But the U.S. entities here, as a practical matter, typically control that speech. Can you give me a citation to the record where I can look to find that? Because I -- I thought that by saying that there wasn't a formal affiliation, but the organizations share the logo and the name and so forth, that there was some absence of control.
And, in fact, that's what the foreign governments, for example, were insisting on. I think -- I think Your Honor is correct that there is -- as a legal matter, there may be the absence of control in some cases, but, in every case, there is practical control.
I think the best citations to the record would be -- for -- for CARE, would be at J.A. 389, which talks about how the CARE entity speaks with a single global voice, and then I think, importantly, J.A. 436 through 445, which discusses CARE U.S.'s ownership of the brand and licenses on the brand, which is, in that case, legal control to dictate what occurs under that brand. Thank -- thank you for that, counsel. You -- you used the phrase ""practical control,"" and I just wonder precisely what your test for that would be. I think the -- the right test here is the risk of attribution.
As this -- as this Court recognized in 2013, there can be a risk of attribution across corporate lines where the entities in question are so clearly identified, as they are here. I think the -- the practical control point is even stronger when those entities speak together with one voice and make their speech and policy decisions together. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Yes, thank you, Chief Justice. The -- did you have an opportunity in the lower courts to discuss or debate what criteria would be used to determine whether or not the two organizations merge or are close -- affiliated closely enough so that the First Amendment rights apply domestically? We did, Your Honor. Judge Marrero gave the parties an opportunity to both submit voluminous materials into the record and to explain to him the relationship between these entities. I think, here, what's important is there is no dispute about the relationship here. These entities are clearly identified with one another.
There's no dispute that they share a name, brand, logo, mission, and voice. And I think critically here there was a two-year period where we worked hard to try to settle this case with the government.
We provided extensive factual information to the government during that period.
We also provided lists of the entities involved, and we offered to stipulate to a definition, and the government rejected that -- that effort by us. But we -- we did make a full effort in the district court and then separately with the government to come to terms on this issue. Well, if you went that far, could you give us just -- give us a recap of what the criteria would be for that affiliation that would be close enough? Yeah, absolutely.
I think, here, the test should be organizations that are part of a global network that share names, brands, logos, missions, and voices.
And I -- I think the reason that that's the right test is because we're talking about attribution by the reasonable observer. As this Court has recognized in a long line of cases that Justice Sotomayor mentioned and that Justice -- Justices Alito and -- and Breyer previously discussed, a long line of cases recognized that there can be attribution across corporate lines, especially with tightly knit international organizations like these. The -- I understand that.
So the one final question, and I know you've covered this, but it would be helpful if you would give us a recap of what precisely you think your injury is. Well, I think the -- the types of injuries are twofold.
The first injury is the compulsion of speech.
And the problem here is that even though the pledge is being imposed on our foreign affiliate, those words are effectively put into the mouths of the U.S. Respondents because of the attribution problem. And the government says: Well, it's no harm to the U.S. organizations because, of course, they can remain neutral. But that's not right.
Once those words are put into the mouths of the U.S. Respondents, they -- they -- that policy position is attributed to them and the harm is done from that compelled speech. The second nature -- the second category of harm comes from the speech restrictions imposed by the regulations.
What those say is the foreign affiliate will lose its funding unless it maintains adequate separation from organizations that say or do anything inconsistent with the policy. So, when the government says that the U.S. organization can disavow the pledge, that comes at a high price, which is the loss of funding for the foreign affiliate. And so the -- the -- the categories of injuries are twofold, one from the speech compulsion and the other from the speech restriction.
It's a catch 22 for these U.S. organizations. Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg? Counsel, I don't follow your last response, because the domestic organization is able to speak for itself, and as far as any attribution of the foreign entity to the domestic organization, AOSI can disclaim the foreign entity's pledge.
It says: We don't take the pledge, and we disclaim any connection to the pledge that's made by foreign entities. It's not our pledge. So they can say, and they say, that pledge, by taking it by the foreign entity, was the price for receiving U.S. dollars.
The foreign -- Justice -- -- organizations continue to work with prostitutes; they have just made a statement that, on the ground, means nothing. Justice Ginsburg, I think this Court had it exactly right in 2013 when it recognized that an organization cannot both avow the government's viewpoint and then turn around and assert a contrary belief or even claim neutrality without appearing hypocritical and without appearing to engage in doublespeak. And the problem here, of course, is that the entities are indistinguishable and they speak as one.
And so focusing on the corporate difference is a mistake.
After all, it's -- it would be odd that the international operating arms of these U.S. organizations are treated differently based on whether they operate through branch offices or through separate corporations. And, in fact, what -- what is wrong with the government's view that this is all by choice is that there are certain jurisdictions where local law and even the U.S. government's own funding criteria require these U.S. Respondents to work through local affiliates. And so we're -- we're -- we're caught unable to disavow, credibly disavow, the speech of an entity that looks just like our client and speaks as one with our client. Let me ask you a question, an -- an argument that you didn't make.
You concede that the foreign entity has no First Amendment rights. But what about the First Amendment obligations of the U.S. -- U.S. government? For example, we can say the Eighth Amendment doesn't apply abroad, but does that mean that the U.S. government official operating abroad is free to torture people? In other words -- Justice Ginsburg -- -- is there a -- -- I think it's an important -- sorry.
I'm sorry for interrupting. And I'm asking whether U.S. actors have an obligation to conform their conduct to constitutional norms? The first response is I don't want the Court to think that we're trying to export the First Amendment.
That's not what we're trying to do.
We're just trying to afford complete relief to U.S. organizations that have First Amendment rights here. But, to Your Honor's good question, I think, in a system with a limited government and a constitution that includes a Bill of Rights, I think there is a fair question about the extent to which the U.S. government can go beyond what it's authorized to do in the Constitution with respect to speech. I guess the other point I would add is that even these clearly identified affiliates overseas, I think the government would concede, have First Amendment rights when they act here in the United States, as they often do when they come here for meetings or to publish papers or to participate in conferences. And the problem with the pledge requirement, of course, is that it binds these organizations forever and for all purposes, both the -- Thank you, counsel. Yes. Justice Breyer? It seems to me the government is prepared to concede that you, the CARE U.S.A., doesn't have to -- doesn't have to oppose prostitution.
But they say the First Amendment doesn't prevent them from telling CARE India that it has to oppose. So why don't you simply write a grant to get all the money yourself and then you give it to CARE India? Why doesn't that work? Well, the -- the problem with that, Your Honor, is that, according to the government, the policy requirement still binds the U.S. organization in the following way: If CARE U.S. gets the money and sub-grants to CARE India, it must carry the burden of the government in the sense of imposing the policy requirement on its own affiliates and police compliance with the policy requirement, not just with respect to the speech and activities of its foreign affiliate but also with respect to itself, lest it violate the regulations which it -- Where do I find in the briefs or in the record just what you said? Because it seems to me just what you said shows that this case is 100 percent about the rights of an American company, the parent, and the question is, can they forbid -- can the government require them to forbid one channel of communicating the message, can it control what they say in that channel? The channel happens to be a channel that goes abroad.
I -- I don't know that there's any precedence for the policy -- the precedent that says they can.
I mean, have I got that right? Is that clear? Yes.
I think the best citations in the record, Justice Breyer, would be the regulations themselves, J.A. 248 to 265. And I would direct Your Honor's attention to the discussion, the commentary of 45 C.F.R. 89.3, and that's at J.A. 256 through J.A. 258, where the government makes very clear that not only do funding recipients have to demonstrate their separation from entities that speak inconsistently, but they even go so far as to say there has to be separation from entities that do not have a policy themselves, suggesting that the government's view is that the U.S. Respondent itself should have a policy. I also think another place to look in the record is at J.A. 375 and 390, where the Pathfinder organization talks about U.S. funding criteria that require them to work through local affiliates and locally incorporated entities. Thank you.
Thank you. Justice Alito? I agreed with your client's position when this case was before us previously.
But what concerns me today is not so much the immediate impact of a decision in your favor but where it would lead. So let me ask, because I am concerned that it will force Congress either to withhold foreign aid entirely or to allow foreign aid to be used in ways that are contrary to the interests of the people of this country.
So let me give you this example. Excuse me.
Suppose that the -- the United States provides grants to domestic entities and allows them -- excuse me -- to make sub-grants to foreign schools for the purpose of promoting education in countries with weak educational systems.
And suppose that Congress specifies that any foreign entity that gets a sub-grant must have a policy denouncing terrorist attacks against American civilians. Would that be unconstitutional? No, it wouldn't be, Your Honor, because that requirement doesn't require the affirmation of a belief and then conformity with that belief and espousing it as one's own. And that -- this requirement -- Well, it does exactly. The school that gets the money must have a policy denouncing terrorist attacks against American civilians.
It's compelled to speak. It doesn't want to make that speech.
It is affiliated with an American entity. Why isn't the argument exactly the same in that situation? I -- I think that there's a problem with germaneness in that case.
The -- the requirement there wouldn't be related to the federal program. But your -- to Your Honor's, I think, larger question, this doesn't turn on the particular ideology. I think any -- any idealogical commitment, any requirement of an idealogical commitment by grantees is problematic for the same reasons as the one here.
What I will -- Yeah, exactly.
That's exactly right.
Let me -- let me ask you one more question before my time expires. Why doesn't the logic of your argument apply to the provision of funds to totally independent foreign entities? So suppose a U.S. entity gets money. Under the Leadership Act, it wants to make a sub-grant to a non-affiliated foreign entity, but it can't do it unless the foreign entity makes -- unless the U.S. entity tells the foreign entity, you cannot use -- you must have a policy opposing prostitution. The U.S. entity is compelled to make a statement that it doesn't want to make.
Why doesn't the logic of your argument apply there? Well, in that case, the entity being made to take the pledge is not clearly identified with the U.S. entity and, therefore, the pledge of the foreign entity doesn't get attributed back to the U.S. entity. And I think that's a very important difference. Here, when the U.S. entity imposes the requirement on its sub-grantee, on its clearly identified foreign affiliate, it's as if it's imposing the pledge requirement on itself, because, after all, these -- these organizations are indistinguishable and speak with one voice. I -- I do think it's important to make the point that the government still has very broad authority to control what happens with its funds, to put in place policies for its programs, and to require that grantees fulfill the requirements of the program in every respect. This particular requirement is unique. There's no other requirement like it in U.S. law.
And I think a decision for Respondents can be very narrow, turning on the facts of this case and the prior ruling of this Court, which declared the policy requirement unconstitutional. Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Counsel, there has been a long history to this case.
I'm not quite sure what the relationship is of your clients to the agency now. Are your clients grant recipients who currently receive grants, who currently work through their foreign affiliates, and their foreign affiliates have not taken this pledge, or have they not received grants and want to work with their foreign affiliates? I'm -- I'm not quite sure what the status is of what the government's been doing or not doing. So these organizations are the same organizations that were before the Court in 2013 but a smaller group because the rest of the clients are too small to have global networks. We now are talking about the entities that were before the Court in 2013 that are the -- the large international entities like CARE and Save the Children and World Vision and Pathfinder that are the ones with their own clearly identified affiliates overseas. And these organizations receive money here in the United States and receive money through their locally incorporated affiliates. CARE, which is the example we've been using, the U.S. entity receives all U.S. grant money under this program and then sub-grants to its local affiliates. And so, in the case of CARE, it has done that under objection.
It -- it asserts that it should be free of this policy requirement.
It believed that the litigation in 2013 would have disposed of this issue.
And it continues to suffer these First Amendment harms and violations that we've been discussing today. I don't -- I'm not sure you've answered my question.
They are receiving the funds.
Are they subcontracting with affiliates or partnering with affiliates and are the affiliates making the pledge and they're complaining about the fact that they're forced to do that? Or have they not been -- and have they not been policing the foreign affiliates and the government's now threatening to take away the funding? Well, it's a little bit of both, Your Honor.
Let me explain. They are receiving the funds, and they are imposing the pledge requirement under objection on their clearly identified foreign affiliates overseas. The government has said that all these years there's been no objection to this practice.
I -- I don't think that's exactly right, with respect to my friend.
In fact, early in the litigation, there was a -- there was a disagreement in the district court about the proper scope of the injunctive relief, and the Respondents wanted broader relief to include sub-grantees.
And the government objected on the ground that those facts were not yet known. And the facts now are known.
That was -- that was fully 12 years ago.
The facts are known.
The record is developed.
The district court entered its findings.
And I think there's no dispute about the nature of the relationship now. And so are they threatening to take away the funding? Why? They are now saying that the policy requirement will be enforced as against the clearly identified foreign affiliates of the U.S. Respondents because, they say, those organizations have no First Amendment rights. We argue that this isn't about any rights of the foreign organizations.
It's about the First Amendment right. No, no, no. Counsel -- Yes. -- I'm sorry for interrupting, but if the foreign affiliates have made the policy statement, what -- so they've done what the government wants.
Why would the government take the funding away from you or them? We -- we object to that policy requirement.
We don't want to have to impose it on our clearly identified affiliates. And it's causing the U.S. Respondents to have to engage in doublespeak.
And if they do that, if they attempt to disavow that pledge, which is attributed to them, they will lose their funding for the global network.
And -- Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch? Counsel, in -- in response to Justice Ginsburg and Justice Thomas, you indicated that the primary harm your client had suffered is the risk of attribution, mistaken attribution, of the foreign affiliate's speech to the domestic entity. That sounds a bit like an alter ego argument, that the ordinary listener will be confused and attribute the speech of a foreign affiliate to the domestic entity. Yet, at the same time, I -- I assume you -- you'd resist any effort to pierce the corporate veil from those foreign entities and impose liability on the domestic entity.
So in what respect is it and when should we attribute speech or actions of foreign affiliates to the domestic entity? Why would we pierce the corporate veil sometimes but not all the time? Your Honor, we don't ask the Court to pierce the veil or to treat these entities as alter egos.
Rather, we're focused on the unique nature of speech and the way speech can be attributed even when corporate formalities are observed. And I think the right line of case law here is not just this Court's decision in 2013 in AOSI but also cases like Pleasant Grove City v. Summum; Walker v. Texas Division, Sons -- Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans; Pacific Gas & Electric; and, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, the Hurley parade case.
All of those cases recognize that legally separate entities or individuals and entities can have speech attributed from one to the other without engaging in any kind of veil-piercing or alter ego analysis, which would get the Court mired into the corporate formalities, which we don't advocate. Rather, we think a more limited holding based on the nature of speech and the First Amendment would suffice. On -- on that score, what evidence is there that there is this risk of confusion or attribution, given that the domestic entity is free to disavow the statements of any foreign affiliates? What -- it seems to me an empirical question.
Do we have any empirics? Yeah, I think the best evidence is -- is in the record in the unrebutted sworn declarations of these organizations, which talk about how they are perceived in the public health community, the price they are paying in the form of hypocrisy and the way that they lose their integrity and their reputation and their brand when they're forced to speak out of two sides of their mouth. The -- the declarations that were -- I -- I understand -- I understand that harm, counsel.
And I'm sorry to interrupt, but I -- I understand the harm that -- that people will see the disavowal and will -- will take cognizance of it. But is that the same thing as anyone really thinking that the domestic entity abides by the government restrictions and endorses them? Does anyone really think that when they -- when they -- when they read that, or do they think that this is a statement made by a foreign entity in order to secure U.S. dollars that obviously the U.S. entity itself does not promote or agree with? Why wouldn't that be the natural reading by the -- by the average reader? Well, I think, when these public health organizations take a pledge saying that they believe something, I think people take it very seriously.
When they say that they believe that HIV/AIDS is transmitted in a certain way or when they say they believe that prostitution should be dealt with in a way that stops the spread of the disease, people listen to them. The reason they're so effective in these programs -- I'm sorry, counsel. Counsel, I accept that, again.
That's not really quite my question. Couldn't a reasonable person hold in his or her mind two things: one, the foreign entity believes X; two, the domestic entity does not believe X? Well, Your Honor, I think that falls apart when the organization speaks with one voice, as these organizations do.
They -- they have a right to speak that way.
They have a right to -- to join with their affiliates in having their -- their -- their common voice and their common mission. And when they're told to say one thing and then disavow it in another breath, I think it undercuts their reputation and brand and their own speech. Well, are -- I think Your Honor had it exactly right. -- are we back then, counsel, to -- to the -- the belief that people will always confuse this as one entity and it's not possible for a local chapter of an organization to have a different view than the national organization or the international organization? That people cannot hold that -- that concept in their heads? Briefly, counsel. Yes, briefly.
I think the public doesn't know that these are separate corporations.
The problem is they're -- they are indistinguishable and they -- they look to the public to be exactly the same. And so it really would be more like Your Honor's case in Masterpiece Cake Shop, making the baker say one thing and then attempt to disavow it in the next breath. Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, counsel.
I want to clarify, first, one thing from your colloquy with Justice Ginsburg.
You agree, I assume, that unaffiliated foreign entities acting abroad have no constitutional rights under this Court's precedents? We do, Your Honor. Okay.
And then I want to pick up on Justice Alito's concern or question about the foreign policy effects of your approach, and I have a hypothetical as well. Suppose the U.S. government wants to fund foreign NGOs that support peace in the Middle East but only if the NGOs explicitly recognize Israel as a legitimate state.
Are you saying the U.S. can't impose that kind of speech restriction on foreign NGOs that are affiliated with U.S. organizations? I think that's a -- a harder case, because I don't -- I don't hear that as requiring affirmation of a belief. Rather, it's in recognizing a fact that the U.S. has established a certain diplomatic relationship with -- with Israel, and the U.S. government gets to say what that relationship is for the United States. I don't think that's making the entities espouse that view as their own.
And so I think that's different.
I think that would be acceptable. That would be acceptable in your view? I -- I think it would be. Okay.
And then the government says that your position would unleash foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations to pump money into the U.S. election process. And I wanted to give you a chance to respond to that claim, which was in the government's reply brief and then repeated here today. Yeah, I -- I disagree with that.
That's a very different case.
That is a -- that is a speech restriction.
It is not speech compulsion.
And that restriction doesn't apply to the U.S. organizations. And so -- and I think this Court dealt with that the right way in Citizens United and distinguished the foreign organizations from the U.S. organizations, and it's a different case. Thank you, counsel. One minute to wrap up, Mr. Bowker. Thank you, Your Honor. Applying the policy requirement to foreign members of these tight-knit international entities fighting HIV/AIDS overseas puts words in the mouths of the U.S. members of those entities, and the program regulations effectively prevent the U.S. members from even disavowing what the foreign members are compelled to say. The injunction should be upheld. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel, three minutes for rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just a few points in rebuttal. First, to respond to Justice Sotomayor's question about facial invalidity, Footnote 1 of our reply brief explains that the government's prior submission was clear that the statute was -- it was being challenged only with respect to domestic entities, and, in fact, a true facial invalidation would invalidate the statute even as applied to foreign entities that have no connection to the United States, which I take it my friend has just conceded is not his position. Second, my friend concedes -- my friend stated that the U.S. entity truly is in control.
And I think that's exactly right.
But that ultimately underscores that it's the U.S. entity, the holder of the First Amendment rights, that is making a choice to affiliate with a foreign entity that accepts Leadership Act funds. Unlike in this case last time and unlike in cases like Hurley and Masterpiece, the U.S. entity is not required to make that choice. The U.S. entity has a separate choice to accept Leadership Act funds itself and operate itself without -- in -- in foreign countries without any risk of hypocrisy or -- or a mixed message. As Justice Gorsuch says, you have to take the sweet with the sour when you decide to set up a separate corporate entity. Now my friend suggests that either U.S. funding conditions or foreign law somehow give an incentive for -- for U.S. entities to use foreign affiliates, but they're not challenging any U.S. funding decisions, which would, we believe, beyond -- be beyond challenge anyway.
And foreign law certainly cannot change the scope of a U.S. entity's First Amendment rights. My -- my friend's position ultimately rests on what he frames as a risk of attribution test.
But I think Judge Straub got it right below when he called that position startling. As Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Alito both, I think, alluded to, that test would be unworkable and it would call into question all manner of U.S. speech restrictions on foreign entities abroad. Now my friend says there's a distinction between speech restrictions and speech compulsions, but the risk of attribution test that he has outlined, where you simply compare names, logos, and brands, has nothing to do with the distinction between speech attribution and speech compulsion. And in all events, the foreign entities here are only, if the -- if the U.S. entities choose, required to make the statement in a -- in a letter to USAID, not to shout it from the mountaintops and not to say anything that will ultimately interfere with the U.S. recipient's message. Finally, I want to note Respondents never made this argument for more than a decade of the litigation.
I think what happened is that, having secured rights for U.S. entities, they decided to ask for the world. But there's no basis in this Court's prior decision or any other source of law for that -- for that holding.
It would invalidate a provision that Congress has adopted and reauthorized and that is working. The decision below should be reversed. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1587, the United States Forest Service versus Cowpasture River Preservation Association, and the consolidated case. Mr. Yang. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the Trails Act converts all federal, state, and private lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail into lands administered by the Park Service.
It does not. The Act simply charges the Secretary of the Interior with overall administration of a trail.
It repeatedly distinguishes between the agency administering the trail and the land managing agencies administering the land.
The Park Service thus coordinates -- or -- agencies and organizations responsible for their own segments of the trail, and informs certain trail-wide responsibilities, but the land managing agencies ultimately -- ultimately take care of the trail on their lands. If a tree falls on Forest lands over the trail, it's the Forest Service that's responsible for it.
You don't call the nine Park Service employees at Harpers Ferry and ask them to come out and fix the tree. Respondents' theory is inconsistent with the Act and would dramatically change the national trail system.
Respondents, for instance, argue that the trail is land and it's administered by the Park Service.
So their position is that the entire trail is federally administered -- a federally administered area of land. But if you look at page 14a, this is Section 1246(h)(1), it requires that the Secretary shall encourage states to operate, develop, and maintain portions of such trails -- and this is scenic trails -- located outside the boundaries of federally-administrated areas. If they're right, there is no thing, nothing, outside the -- the trail outside the federally-administrated areas because the trail is a federally-administered area.
Their reading cannot be right. Second -- it would also dramatically increase -- dramatically change the trail system by transferring vast amounts of land into the National Park Service, which the Park -- the Park System, which the Park Service administers and regulates to conserve the natural environment.
Not only would TVA's two hydroelectric dams be put in the system; nearly a thousand miles of the Forest Service lands, more than a dozen towns, including Hanover, New Hampshire and Dartmouth College, which crosses straight through, numerous bridges over rivers, including the bridge over the Hudson near West Point, over 600 roads, a hundred interstates and other highways.
And until this case, no one has ever thought that such all lands and waters under the trails were -- Mr. Yang, may I ask you a preliminary -- Sure. -- preliminary question? This issue of the Mineral Leasing Act is the third of the issues that the Fourth Circuit dealt with, and it was the one to which they devoted the least number of pages. This case, in any event, am I right, is going back for reconsideration of the environmental consequences, going back under the Forest Management Act and the National -- NEPA? Correct. So, since those reviews will be going on, is there the potential that the Mineral Leasing Act question will be moot because the decision might be that under that legislation, the environmental legislation, this crossing over of the -- the trail is impermissible? Yeah, it -- the case -- that issue is not moot now.
It could potentially be moot, but that is true about inter- -- any interlocutory case that this -- the Court takes up.
Things can change that -- that make the issue before the Court no longer necessary at the end of the day. But the Court already considered that at the cert stage.
The reason that this is an important issue is because if the trail cannot be -- the right-of-way cannot cross 600 feet under the trail and come in and out not on Park Service or Forest Service property but on private land, then the whole enterprise is done. We're done.
They have to start over. So that is an important and nationally significant issue that the Court granted cert on.
So that's why we're here. But then what do we make of the line in the reply brief that says ""no one doubts that the trail is in the National Park System""? I think what we're saying is that the trail is administered by the Park Service.
It's not lands in the National Park System. One of the main issues in this case is whether -- in stating that the Secretary of the Interior shall primarily administer the trail as a foot -- the Appalachian Trail as a footpath, whether that delegation, which Congress then said concerns the overall administration of the trail, whether that confers authority to administer the lands over which the trail passes. And our answer is that is not the case, and it's inconsistent, not only with the text of the statute, but the way that the statute has been implemented, as well as the way that the Appalachian Trail has existed even before the statute. Well -- Mr. Yang, you -- -- is it inconsistent with the statutory provision that says the National Park System -- well, first we're told, yes, this trail is in the National Park System, and then the statutory definition of the National Park System says it consists of certain areas of land and water.
So how is the trail not land if it's in the National Park System? What -- what part of the reply? I'm trying to -- I don't remember -- The -- -- it saying that. -- reply brief, 17, says, ""No one doubts that the trail"" -- I think it's toward the end of the page -- ""no one doubts that the trail is in the National Park System."" I'm not seeing -- is this our reply brief? No, it's the other reply brief. Oh.
I think, Mr. Clement -- I don't have that in front of me right now.
I think Mr. -- Then maybe we'll ask Mr. Clement. Mr. Clement may be able to address that.
But I think our -- our view, and I think it's shared by Mr. Clement, that the -- the trail is not land and certainly not land that's administered within the meaning of the Mineral -- It's a -- -- Leasing Act. -- difficult distinction to wrap one's head around, Mr. Yang. You know, I -- I would understand -- if you said to me the trail traverses the forest, everybody would understand what that meant.
There's some broader forest and the trail cuts a path through it. But you're saying that the trail is distinct from the trail.
I mean, from the -- from the land that is the trail.
I don't know really quite how to say it except that nobody makes this distinction in real life. I -- I don't know if that's -- When you walk on the trail, when you bike on the trail, when you backpack on the trail, you're backpacking and biking and walking on land, aren't you? You're certainly sometimes walking on land.
You're also walking on things like bridges.
You're also walking on -- for instance, trails include waterways. So Congress recently enacted, expanded the Lewis and Clark Trail to include the Ohio River.
All of the Ohio River from Pittsburgh to the Mississippi, then the Missouri up to St. Louis, and all the way to the -- to the West Coast from there.
No one thinks that those waters are all in the National Park Service. And that's because the trail traverses the lands and waters, and when you move a trail -- these trails get relocated for all kinds of reasons small or -- or large. They might get relocated, but that just means that the -- now there's different land.
And it just -- But that means that the trail isn't -- As a matter of plain English -- I mean, both of your briefs -- and you're great brief writers and you're great writers, and -- and the briefs are -- are strange to read because you can't ever just say what you mean, which is that the trail is a piece of land, so you find yourself wrapped up in these strange locutions about the trail traversing land. It -- it's like you're imagining some thing that goes on top of it somehow. I don't believe so.
This -- the Trails Act needs to be read in the context of all the statutes that deal with land administration.
This is a large area of the law. Those trails -- those -- those statutes make very clear when Congress wants to shift administrative responsibility over land. So, for instance, the Rivers Act enacted the very same day -- Let me ask you a question, Mr. Yang, because you said, and this would be very meaningful to me, you said you would call the Forest Service if there -- if a -- if a tree fell over the path. Yep. I -- I guess I -- when I looked at these regulations, what strikes me about them is that on the Appalachian Trail, it seems to me that the National Park Service -- it would be different on the Pacific Trail, which is a weirdness of its own, but -- but on -- in the -- on the Appalachian Trail, it's the National Park Service that regulates uses along the trail, vehicles on the trail, development and maintenance of the trail. In other words, it's the National Park Service that basically does land use regulation and the land is the trail. The regulation I believe you are talking about is in a(i), this -- the authority that you're talking about? This is -- this is 1246 -- it's the statute, 1246(c). Right. 1246(f) -- Well -- 1246(h)(1), 1246(i) -- (i) requires that the -- Excuse me.
It basically puts the director of the Park Service in charge of regulating land use on the trail, on the land. I don't think that's correct.
It does provide for certain things. Trail markers, if you're looking at (c), it -- Congress forbids cars on trails. When you're looking at regulatory authority, that's under (i), there it requires the concurrence of the heads of any other federal agencies administering the lands.
And, in fact, the way this has been implemented is the -- the Park Service has enacted a regulation at 36 CFR 7.100, that applies only on Park Service-administered land. I will just give you an example and you can tell me what you make of it because it would seem to me to cover the case where the tree falls on the trail. It says, this is 1246(h)(1): ""The Secretary charged with the administration"" -- which here is the Secretary of Interior -- ""shall provide for the development and maintenance of these trails."" Yes.
And it says ""shall provide for,"" not do it.
The way that that's provided for is the way it's always been provided for, which is through a memorandum of agreement with the land managing agencies.
So the Forest Service has a memorandum of agreement that dates back to 1970 and it requires the Forest Service -- Mr. Yang, before your time goes on, because it's inherent in how you're answering Justice Kagan, why is it that two agencies can't have simultaneous administration, and even possibly management responsibilities? I -- I'm -- was taken with the NRDC's amicus brief, and the Mineral Leasing Act has an entire provision devoted to when are two agencies responsible to administer a piece of land. That -- Let me finish my question.
And assuming that I accept that two agencies can both administer, wouldn't the Trail Act supersede the mineral -- the Forest Department's permission to grant a right-of-way for pipes, because doesn't the Trail Act supersede any other permission? The answer is no, there needs to be more clarity.
Congress acts clearly when it does that, but let me address -- Well, it has, it has, but why can't two agencies have simultaneous or coexistent responsibilities? Your -- your time has expired but I will allow you to very briefly respond. There is three types of instances where that happens.
Two separate trails, parcels administered separately.
A right-of-way goes through it.
That's one. There's another instance where land's withdrawn from the public lands and provided for a military use.
That is in some ways dual, but it's not in the relevant sense because it is temporarily separated. And then, third, sometimes you take mineral rights and leave it with the underlying agency, but nothing like this with contemporaneous and coterminous administration of the land. You're requiring two agency heads with different agencies managing -- Thank you. -- different systems to -- to regulate the same thing. Thank you, Mr. -- Mr.
Yang. Mr. Clement. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Respondents' effort to convert all of the land traversed by a Park Service-administered trail into lands in the National Park Service fails for reasons of text, context, and consequences. First, as a matter of text, multiple provisions of the Trails Act draw a distinction between the trail and the land it traverses and makes clear that administrative authority is granted only over the former and leaves the latter jurisdiction over the lands themselves undisturbed. Moreover, the Trails Act itself makes clear that the trail can be moved.
It makes sense for a trail or a trail route to move every time a tree falls.
It doesn't make sense for the status of lands to change every time the route moves. The context powerfully reinforces this key distinction.
If you want to see a model of a statute that transfers land between federal agencies and makes the land subject to the Organic Act, you need look no further than the Rivers Act passed the same day by the same Congress. The reason, though, when it did that in the Rivers Act it did exactly what you'd expect it to do when it transfers land, it talked about the width of the land transferred, the acreage involved and then left no doubt that if the land was transferred to the Park Service, it became subject to the Organic Act. And then, of course, there are the untenable consequences of Respondents' tradition -- position.
Thousands and thousands of acres of park land gets transferred to the Forest Service and these thousand mile trails get converted into barriers to pipeline development. Where is the pipeline? I'm -- I'm trying to -- not in two dimensions, but in three.
I mean, think of a trail -- what I couldn't get out of the briefs, I mean, there's a trail -- Yeah. -- and say it's going across a ridge.
It's going along a ridge. Now, they don't want to put the pipeline on the trail.
They want to put it somewhere underground.
Well, how far from where the trail is up here, how far below is the pipeline supposed to go? Six hundred feet. Six hundred feet below. So -- And where does it enter? Does it enter on -- on, you know, there is an easement or something for views and so forth? Right, right. Does it enter the ground within the area that is within that easement or before and it comes out after? It enters and exits on private land, not on Forest Service land. I see.
Okay. The problem with briefs -- Got it. -- is they're two-dimensional. Got it.
Got it. Yeah. But, I mean, the way to understand this, there is a ridge line.
Up here on the top of the ridge is the Appalachian Trail and the Blue Ridge Parkway.
And then the pipeline route goes under both, 600 feet below the trail and probably 800 feet below the parkway, because the parkway's a little bit higher -- And it enters -- -- on that -- -- before you get to the area -- Exactly. -- and leaves after the area? Which is reserved to the trail or the views. Exactly.
Which is why both the Park Service and the Forest Service who care very much about the experience on both the trail and the Parkway could conclude that this particular pipeline, given how far below all of the action it was crossing, did not disturb the experience -- Well -- -- of the trail or the pipeline. Now I had the same thought as Justice Breyer, but maybe there's something wrong with this simple way of looking at the case.
When I think of a trail, I think of something that is on top of the earth. And when I think of a pipeline that is 600 feet below the surface, that doesn't seem like a trail.
So instead of having to draw this distinction between the trail and the land, why can't we just say that the trail is on the surface and something that happens 600 feet below the surface is not the trail? You could do that, Justice Alito, and I suppose my clients would be perfectly happy to win this case on that ground. I do think, though, that there is a critical difference between administrative authority over that trail up there and administrative authority over the lands. And it may be a little bit hard to square with your first reading of 1246(h)(1), but it is the case that when a tree falls in the national forest in Georgia or in New Hampshire, the nine or ten federal employees who are the entire total of the park unit in -- that administers the trail from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia do not get on a plane and fly up to New Hampshire and Georgia and deal with it. So -- It's the Forest Service. So what is the practical difference between viewing the case in those two ways, surface, 600 feet below, trail, land.
What -- what is the difference between those? So for pipelines, I suppose, because most of them are going to go pretty far under, I -- I think you could draw that distinction.
I think, though, as a practical matter, you would still have differences. I mean, I'll give you just one very practical example.
In the national forest up in New Hampshire, one of -- because national forests are for multi-uses, unlike the Park Service's, which are supposed -- I know. -- to be conserved and unimpaired, so Park -- Forest land can be used for multiple purposes. One of the purposes that is allowed in New Hampshire is to tap the maple trees to get sap out of the trees.
The sap lines run across the surface of the trail. And they do that with the permission of the Forest Service.
So that's something that, you know, I think if you were to construe all of a sudden that the surface is in -- is lands in the National Park Service, that would all of a sudden -- No, but that -- -- be under the Park Service jurisdiction. I think that isn't quite the question.
I mean, we don't have to decide every issue, you know, in the Park Service.
And if the people who make the sap want to challenge it or somebody, fine.
The question was what harm would we do if we just restrict this to the question that answers it, that -- in your view? You'd win, you'd said, but it would have to do with pipelines, and it would have to do with things you cannot see from the trail, and it would have to do with things that are well below the ground. And on those, which is before -- you see, that's, I think, the point.
And we don't -- why decide cases in this Court that have all kinds of implications which we can't quite see, like that one? If somebody wants to challenge the Park Service coming and removing a tree, let them. So, Justice Breyer, I represent the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.
It's not my job to resist winning this case on a narrow ground. (Laughter.) So I am not going to do that. Mr. Clement -- Yeah. Mr. Clement, I'm very grateful you said that.
I think that there are, aren't there, some problems with that view inherent in the language of the Act and in definitions? Doesn't the Act give the Park Service the right for easements below or on top of the trail? That's not how we read that provision, Justice Sotomayor.
I mean, we agree with the government in its reply brief that the right way to read 1248(a) is that if it's on Forest Service land, it's the Forest Service that could grant an easement and if it's -- Then let me take a different -- -- on Park Service land -- -- tact. Generally, when you speak of land, surface land, you're talking about the land underneath it? That's what the cases mostly say, if -- almost always, unless you separate out the two? Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not going to spend too much time disagreeing with you because there is a reason we briefed the case the way we briefed it. So why don't you explain that reason? Why -- there is a superficial appeal -- I -- after reading -- Sure. -- the briefs and looking at the statute, didn't think it was viable.
You didn't either, or you would have briefed it this way. Well, I -- I think it's viable.
And I would say one -- It's just -- If I could say one thing in limited defense of it, which is to say when you have -- and we have a case that we cite to this effect, and it's a case of this Court in our reply brief, that generally speaking if you grant a right-of-way, which is one way of thinking about the trail, it doesn't affect subsurface rights.
So that actually does support this way of thinking about it. But here's why we briefed it in the more straightforward way that you do have to maintain the difference between the trail and the lands.
And that is because the argument on the other side is not limited to the Appalachian Trail.
It's not even limited to federal lands. It says that all of the lands -- because the Park Service administers the whole trail.
And it's not just the Appalachian Trail.
There's about two dozen trails that the Park Service administers. And they not only go over bridges and roads; some of them are downtown.
I mean, the Park Service administers the Selma to Montgomery National Historical Trail.
Now, if that trail is lands in the Park Service because we just can't get our head around the idea that trails are different from land, then parts of downtown Selma, downtown Montgomery are lands of the National Park Service. The Oregon National Historical Trail, also administered by the Park Service, starts in downtown Kansas City, ends up in downtown Portland, Oregon.
I don't think downtown Kansas City or Portland, Oregon are lands in the National Park Service. Mr. Clement, could -- if -- if we go back to Justice Alito's idea, which was also the way I thought about it, that that was the way to cut this -- but then I started looking around and the -- the mineral -- I wondered whether you can win under that approach. So here's is the argument that you can't win under the surface/subsurface approach, is that -- is that the Mineral Leasing Act gives the authority to do rights-of-way, including pipelines, to the -- to the -- to the secretary that has -- it talks about the surface.
It says where the surface of all the federal lands involved in a proposed right-of-way is under the jurisdiction of one federal agency, the agency head is authorized to grant the right-of-way. So that suggests under the MLA, that the right-of-way, the substratum, is given to the person with control over the surface.
Is that not true? So if I were going to warm to the topic of trying to win this case on the alternative ground, what I would tell you about that is I would say that's not how I actually read the provisions together.
That's -- that's sort of a subsidiary provision that says how you deal with pipeline rights-of-way when you have two agencies with jurisdiction over the surface.
And it uses that formulation, but when it's really trying to figure out what's the right agency head, it asks which agency head has jurisdiction over the lands.
And I think that that -- it doesn't say surface in that provision.
And I think that's the critical provision. But with one more word about sort of the theory we've actually articulated, I do think if you look at all of these trails, you'll see why Congress picked a different term.
And I think it's important to know, it's not like we don't have a term in the statute for the trails. They are components in the national trail system.
And that's what Congress called them that. And they called them that on the same day they passed the Rivers Act, where they actually talked about transferring jurisdiction, they talked about acreage.
There's a separate section of the Rivers Act, section 1280, that talks about the interaction of the Rivers Act and the Mineral Leasing Act.
All of that was necessary because Congress knew what it was doing and it was transferring land and making new lands in the National Park System subject to the Organic Act.
It said it in haec verba. It was doing no such thing in the Trails Act.
Congress isn't crazy.
They were creating tens of thousands of miles of trails, most of which would be administered by the Park Service.
They were under no delusion that they were, like, quadrupling -- I don't know, probably 40 times increasing the size of the lands in the National Park System. If you look at those two maps at the back of our reply brief, you can see the difference in the implications of the theories. It's very modest to look at the second map, which shows you sort of what I would have called before I got involved in this case the true National Park System.
Easy enough to steer a pipeline around that. If you look at the national trails system, it would be a huge barrier to pipeline development.
And if you're ever going to apply the elephants-in-the-mouse-hole-type approach to a statute, this is one where it really calls out -- especially if you think about the Trails Act, it's got those wonderful quaint provisions that are getting into the details of whether the Park Service or the Forest Service or the private landowners are the ones that should blaze the trail. A statute that addresses those kind of details in that kind of granular specificity should not be interpreted to have these transformative effects sub silentio.
And don't forget -- I mean, I know you said it's -- well, there is that Pacific Crest Trail, there's also the Continental Divide Trail, there's also the Pacific Northwest Trail, who are all administered by the Forest Service. What do you do with your line that I asked Mr. Yang about? So -- Because you have said that the trail is in the National Park System. So, Justice Ginsburg, with all respect, what I do with that line is I keep reading, because it says no one doubts that the trail is in the Park System to the extent that the Park System administers the trail. And to that extent, it is in the National Park System.
There are nine or ten rangers sitting in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and they have Park Service uniforms.
So it -- and -- and there probably are statements, offhanded statements, in documents by the Park Service that says, yeah, the trail -- the entire trail is in the Park Service.
But that doesn't make all of the lands traversed by the trail lands in the National Park Service pursuant to the Organic Act. That view of the statute creates all sorts of anomalies.
All of the other lands of the National Park Service are subject to regulation by the Secretary of Interior the way you would expect it to, without having to get any assent from another agency. When the statute says that the Park System consists of lands administered by the Park Service, does it mean administered in full, administered exclusively by the Park Service, or administered in any sense by the Park Service? I think if it has to mean one of those things, it probably means administered in full.
But what I think it really, really means is lands. And I think that -- I mean, although it -- you know, I don't really think it's as metaphysical as you think.
I mean, the -- the philosophers at the Park Service and the Forest Service haven't had any problem with this for 50 years.
They have dealt with the reality that the trail is, in an administrative sense, under the Park Service, but on a day-to-day basis, the lands stay where they are.
The Park Service -- Let me -- let me ask you this -- Sure. -- before your time runs out.
Is the office of the Park Service -- I assume the Park Service has an office here in Washington? Yes. Is that part of the -- is that part of the Park System? I don't think it's an area of land administered by the Park Service. But the -- but it's administered by the Park Service, isn't it? No, you're right.
And it's in the National Park system in some sense. It is? Yeah, but I don't think they have to maintain that building in its unimpaired national state -- natural state, which just goes to show not everything that's in the Park System in some loose sense is subject to the restrictions of the Organic Act, which required the system -- the Service to keep them in an unimpaired state.
Many thanks. Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Kellogg. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to go directly to the question of whether there's an easy out in this case by saying it's 600 feet under the ground, so it doesn't count.
I'll call the Court's attention to 1248(a), which specifically says that rights of ways are to be granted by the Secretary of the Interior in this case for anything, ""rights-of-ways upon, over, under, across, or along any components"" of the Appalachian Trail. So ""under"" counts, as Justice Kagan pointed out, the Mineral Leasing Act itself talks about who has jurisdiction over the surface lands.
Obviously the pipeline is going to go under those lands, but it's the one who administers the surface of the lands. And we know that the Park Service administer these lands because Congress made that very clear in the three interlocking statutes at issue here. The Trails Act in 1968 says, without any equivocation, the Appalachian Trail shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior who has delegated that to the Park Service.
The General Authorities Act two years later said all areas administered by the Park Service, without limitation, are part of one National Park System. If it's administered by the Park Service, it is an area of land or water. Whether it's a historic building, whether it's a monument, whether it's a parkway, or whether it's a trail, it is -- if it's administered, it counts as an area of land, which the Court in the Sturgeon case pointed out it's up to Congress to decide how broadly to use the term ""land"" in a statute. And, finally, the Mineral Leasing Act makes it absolutely clear that it extends the rights for oil and gas pipelines to all federal lands, except lands in the National Park System. Mr. Kellogg -- Counsel, could you -- -- if you have an easement over land, is there anything unusual about that that someone, a separation, in other words, before traversing over the land and recognition that the land itself belongs to somebody else? Well, we're not saying if there's -- let's say we have an easement for the trail over private land or state land.
The Mineral Leasing Act doesn't cover those. No, no, I know, I'm not talking -- I'm speaking -- They can build a pipeline under private lands or under state lands and, in fact, they have done two of that under the Appalachian Trail in just the past five years. I'm thinking more, there seems to be a debate on some metaphysical level about whether you can have a trail, whether you can have land under it, or interests in land that are different.
I just -- it doesn't strike me as that unusual a concept that there are property rights that are distinct from rights in the land. But that still -- I mean, if I give somebody an easement to walk across my backyard to get somewhere, I -- I don't think that I'm giving up the land.
It's still my land. Well, that -- as we point out in the brief, there are two definitions of right-of-way.
One is an abstract right of passage over somebody else's land.
And the other refers to the strip of land itself over which passage is maintained. The Trails Act repeatedly uses the second definition, when it says you are going to require rights of ways for the trail.
You can use condemnation proceedings to acquire land for the trail. And most importantly of all, when it says you can grant, the Secretary -- the Park Service grant a right-of-way over the trail.
So even using the first definition as a right of passage over land, it's indicating that the trail itself is land. When the -- when the trail crosses private land, what property rights do you think the Park Service has with respect to those private lands? I wouldn't say that they have property rights, but as with any in-holding of the National Park System or the Forest Service, which has lots of in-holdings of private land, there is still certain regulations that can be established for those lands. Well, I don't think that answers my question.
Do they have any property rights over the private land? They have -- Can the Trail Act take any property rights away from private landowners, other than the -- essentially an easement? Essentially what they have is an easement.
But this Court has made clear -- first of all, I should point out that the Forest Service regulations specifically exclude private and state lands from the applicability of their regulations, with a few exceptions. Like in 36 CFR 6.2 it says you can't put solid waste in these private lands. Well, if you have only -- So there is some restrictions. If you have only an easement over private land, do you have anything more over land that is administered by the Forest Service? The land is administered by the Park Service.
And that's absolutely clear in the Trails Act when it says such things as the Park Service gets to select and choose the route, they decide the width of the trail, they establish the acreage for the trail, which they've done here, which is 250,000 acres along the entire length of the trail.
All of which they say is a unit of the Park System. Your -- Once the trail is the trail, who regulates its use and who takes care of it? Well, authority can be divided.
Overall administration authority is by the Park Service, but specific management responsibility can be delegated to particular other federal agencies or even to volunteer groups or state groups. And -- and -- and what -- what actually is the case here? Suppose there were a regulation that said there shall be no snowmobiling on the trail.
Where would that regulation come from? It would be in 36 CFR, which is the Park Service regulations.
1246(i) specifically says it's up to the Park Service to establish regulations governing units of -- governing the trail. Just as the Park System Organic Act says it's up to the Park Service to decide what regulations -- Mr. Kellogg -- -- govern the Park System. -- let's go back to -- let's go back to what the other side argued was the nightmare of this case.
I'm not sure you have quite answered Justice Alito and getting to what you're asking -- answering to Justice Kagan. It runs through cities, the trail.
It runs through downtown Selma.
I think we were told in downtown somewhere else.
Can the -- does the Park Service, can it regulate the use of that area? Can it put, at -- at a halt, everything that happens in downtown Selma? Certainly not. So -- But to the extent to which you can regulate, that's a question the Court left open in the Sturgeon case for in-holdings, how much -- if it's part of the Park Service, part of the Forest Service, how much can you regulate private in-holdings? And I think there's severe limitations on that, which is why the Park Service has said we're not regulating that. So is downtown Selma an in-holding in the Park Service? I'm sorry? Is downtown Selma an in-holding on the Park Service in your theory of the case? If there's a -- for example, if there is a national historic trail through that area -- There is.
We know that to be true. Yes, there is.
Congress in the National Historic Trails Act specifically said that there is no regulatory power on -- on national historic trails for private, state, and local lands. They said exactly the opposite in the Trails Act when they said -- - Wouldn't -- go ahead, please. Keep going, sorry. I was going to say they said exactly the opposite in the Trails Act where they said that the Secretary administers the entire trail. What about the -- what about that? Please. Just take the same question and apply it to one of these kinds of trails. Yeah. I mean, maybe it's not Selma.
Maybe it's Hanover, New Hampshire, exactly the same question. Or Kansas City.
You choose. Kansas City.
Is there like a barrier across -- I mean, that's what's a little bit tough on your side.
The statutes, you know, it's like ping pong, you know, they have this, you have that. But the thing that I -- is worrying me the most is just what was asked.
So all you have to do is take the same question, okay, you got it? Yep. Okay.
What's the answer? (Laughter.) Okay.
So the answer is they can't go into downtown Hanover and say we're the federal government and we're going to control how you use the sidewalks, et cetera. But they are going to -- Not the sidewalks. What happened is this is a -- a national -- a state park, and under the ground are some Native American remains, you know, and they would like to have access to those.
It isn't going to affect the trail and so forth, and they don't want to ask anybody.
They just want to do it. All right? So -- so what now? Unless there is another federal law -- No. -- that applies to digging up Indian remains, then they could do it, because -- Why? They could do it because the Park Service has control over the trail on federal lands, but its regulations do not extend to the trail where it goes over state -- As far as the statute is concerned, can they do it? We get a Park Service that doesn't like X.
They don't want to do it.
Can they do it? I mean, and it's underground.
In other words -- If they are taking -- No, no.
What it is, it's more like an easement.
If you see it more like an easement, more like an easement, or covering the surface, then, of course, if it goes across private land or it goes across a state park or goes across a city, then the state or the city or the -- whatever it is, has a right to use their land as they wish. If it's part going down into the earth a thousand feet or to the center of the earth, I don't know where these things go, but if that's the case, maybe they can do it, but only if the Park Service agrees.
See, is that -- that's -- Well, I -- I think that's right.
I mean, I think -- the easement is very easy to understand how this would work, but if it's -- property actually belongs to the Park Service, is in the Park Service system, then I think Justice Breyer has an interesting point. And, relatedly, I'm -- I'm having -- I'm struggling with understanding how -- what the answer to this question is: Congress, when it -- when it set out who's going to administer these trails, said that the Park Service gets to administer the ones in the east, where the Forest Service owns the land, and the Forest Service gets to administer the ones in the west, where the Park Service owns the land.
It was kind of a -- you can understand that if it's easements, again, you can understand that. Everybody's getting a little bit of something in each other's territory. But if the land goes with the -- the assignment of the management authority for the trail, then you have the circumstance that a lot of western national parks: Sequoia, Yosemite, others, there are now ribbons throughout those national parks that belong to the Forest Service and that would be at least open to pipeline development. So while you might thwart a pipeline here, you -- it's not a costless -- it's not a zero-sum gain.
You're going to invite pipelines elsewhere.
Now, you might tell me nobody is seeking a pipeline there, but that's not a very good answer, is it? So on what account, I guess I'm asking, would a rational Congress have opened up western national parks to development like this? Well, first of all, I don't think that has happened, Your Honor, because -- I -- I -- I knew you were going to say that. (Laughter.) If -- take the Pacific Crest Trail.
It runs through certain portions that are, as you point out, national parks. They could not build a pipeline across those because you can't go under the National Park Service land, even if the trail is administered by the Forest Service.
Where it runs across Forest Service lands, where it runs across state, local, or private lands, then the -- the Mineral Leasing Act would allow a pipeline to run. Now, they raise the hypothetical, well, couldn't the -- the Forest Service dig up the entire trail and snake a pipeline through there? I would suggest, no, both as a legal matter and of course as a practical matter, they couldn't.
But as a legal matter, they couldn't because they can only allow uses that are consistent with the purposes of the trail.
So I think that's a -- that's a false hypothetical. There's no question that back in 1970, Congress -- it was 1968, Congress was saying, okay, we've got -- we want to establish all these national trails.
We're going to give some to the Forest Service.
We're going to give some to the Park Service.
And they're going to be the administrator of those trails, the overall administrators. Every statute that assigns jurisdiction over land to a federal agency uses the word ""administration."" It's in the -- What about the -- excuse me.
What about the argument that there's -- you have textual arguments, the other side has textual arguments, but your position has significant consequences to it, enormous consequences. And Congress did not use language in this Act like it did in the Rivers Act passed on the same day.
And the argument goes, you would expect to see clear language like that to generate the significant consequences that your position has. You know, I would suggest that Congress used exactly language like that in the Rivers Act.
The Rivers Act had to be a little more specific because it put the -- the -- Wild and Scenic Rivers along with their adjacent lands directly into the Park Service. And so it had to specify that it was talking about land as well as the water. But it used the same term, ""administered by,"" that you find in the Trails Act, that you find in the Weeks Act, that you find in the Blue Ridge Parkway Act.
In every instance where Congress assigns jurisdiction over land, it uses that term. And to be clear, the Forest Service doesn't own the land.
The Park Service doesn't own the land.
All the land belongs to the federal government.
It's administered by agencies designated by Congress, which is exactly what they did in the 1968 Act.
And -- Is there any reason why the Secretary of the Interior had to delegate this to the Park Service? It did not have to.
It was assumed by Congress that it would do so, because throughout the Trails Act, it talks about when it's the Secretary of Interior, you apply the rules applicable to the -- So if Congress really wanted to bring about the result that you think the statutes commands, why wouldn't it leave that option? Why wouldn't it require that it be administered by the Park Service, rather than by the Secretary of the Interior? So the initial Trails Act decided the question about pipeline rights-of-ways, et cetera.
That took two more steps.
It took the 1970 General Authorities Act, in which Congress said we want all these disparate areas that the Park Service administered and we want to treat them on a par. Mr. Kellogg, I think the question that Justice Alito is getting at troubles me too, and I'm not sure you quite got there. Could the Secretary of the Interior reassign these lands from the Park Service to the Fish and Wildlife Service and then allow -- At this point, I don't think they -- -- and then allow pipelines? At this point, I don't think so.
Once it's in the parks system, it works as -- seems to work as a one-way route. Okay, but it's -- There's no authority -- Could it -- could -- -- to decommission. But the Secretary of the Interior could have done so? Could have done so, that's correct.
And, in fact, some trails have been and some scenic rivers have been delegated to the Fish and Wildlife -- And why isn't that a strike against your interpretation? Because if Congress had wanted to ensure that these trails were left undisturbed, it could have simply made that assignment directly. Because the critical act, from our purposes, is the 1970 Act.
Not so much the 1968 Trails Act, but the 1970 General Authorities Act. If you read the government's reply brief at 16-17, they make some concessions that I think essentially concede away the case.
They said, back in 1970, the Park Service listed as units the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Appalachian Trail, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers, but it kept those separate and apart in its listing, said these were miscellaneous areas, these are recreation areas; these aren't national parks. And then Congress came along in the General Authorities Act and said: No, no, no, everything you administer is a unit of the Park Service.
So as a consequence, two years later, when the Forest Service -- when the Park Service published its new list, it listed the Wild and Scenic Rivers, the Blue Ridge Parkway, and the Appalachian Trail all as units of the Park System on a par -- So -- -- with national parks. So do you -- is this right that you think that -- think of Yosemite. I think that belongs to the federal government, and I think it belongs to the federal government down to the center of the earth.
I mean, I don't know how far you go down when you have property.
Maybe you go to the center of the earth. Is your position that that's true of all the trails too? It certainly -- And if -- that's -- that's really what I'm -- yeah, okay.
Go ahead, answer. Yes, it's -- it's my position, it's our position, that if -- whatever agency administers the trail also can award, decide right-of-ways across that trail, but only consistent with their own rules and regulations. So that it -- Well, then why does the statute -- -- really does -- it really does erect a impermeable barrier to any pipeline from the area where the natural gas, those resources are located and to the area east of it where there's more of a need for them? Absolutely incorrect, Your Honor, I'm sorry, but the -- there's 55 pipelines currently running under the Appalachian Trail; 19 of those are on federal land pursuant to permanent easements granted before the Trails Act.
The rest of them are on state and local lands.
Two -- I guess maybe -- maybe I'm not entirely incorrect, but that seems to suggest if it is not the Appalachian Trail land that runs through private property or were preexisting, that to the extent it is, I'll call, regular Appalachian Trail land, it does operate as a barrier? Only on federal land. Why? Well, that's what we're talking about. Because the Mineral Leasing Act only applies to federal land, and it only exempts land in the National Park Service from the definition of federal land. So state, local, and private lands are unaffected.
The -- State -- state, local -- state, local, private lands are unaffected.
Forest Service lands, through which the trails run, are unaffected.
The only thing affected is where there happens to be a trail? Is the trail, plus its protective corridor, which is about a thousand feet wide, and which the Park Service, despite their efforts in the reply brief to walk that back, if you look at page 97 of the Joint Appendix, they run through the numbers. You know, it's 2,190 miles long.
It's a thousand feet wide.
And they say that's 250,000 acres in the National Park System. Those acres are included in their calculation of the 89 million acres that are part of the -- But -- but you see -- Mr. Kellogg do you think -- Go back for just a second.
Because once you said yes to the center of the earth.
Okay.
Now, I'm -- I'm quite pleased, I guess as a person, not a judge, that Yosemite does go down as far as, but it worries me, because what you answered the Chief Justice and the others is, well, Congress has an Act that takes care of that. It exempts the private people.
But I think we're here concerned not with Congress's statutes so much -- of course we are -- but -- but you see, if you're saying it goes down to the center of the earth, then there are all kinds of things some other Congress might do. This land belongs to the federal government down to the center of the earth. And actually what's worrying me is something with that consequence, perhaps Congress would have done more to make clear. But am I right on my consequence that -- are you following that? I do, Your Honor. And -- and -- and am I right? That the subsurface lands also belong to the United States? Yes.
So Congress could do what it wants, in cities, in -- in cities, in private property, et cetera. No, you are not right -- Because of the statute or because of something else? Because the Mineral Leasing Act applies only to federal lands. Well -- And the Park Service does not purport to regulate private, state, and local in-holdings.
So that's not going to happen. Mr. Kellogg, do you think it's possible that these trails are jointly administered, that there is some kind of joint jurisdiction over them? And if that's what is going on here, what would be the effect of that on this question? Well, first of all, if that were what's going on, the Court would have to reverse, because under 185(c)(2) of the Mineral Leasing Act, it says that if the -- if the surface lands are administered by either the Secretary of the Interior or by the Secretary and more -- and one or more other agencies, then only the Secretary of the Interior can grant -- I guess what I was suggesting is something along the following lines: You have the Weeks Act.
And the Trails Act comes along and it does not completely repeal the Weeks Act.
It just layers onto the Weeks Act jurisdiction in the Secretary delegated to the Park Service that goes along with the Weeks Act, and then assumes that these two agencies will figure out a sensible distribution of regulatory and other authority. And if that's the case, and that's what happened -- has happened, do you -- does -- does -- is it necessarily true that the Secretary has authority over the right-of-way that's at issue here? Well, 1248(a) says explicitly that it's either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, and as the case may be, we know refers to the Secretary who administers the land. The government in its reply brief recognizes that's a fatal point for them, and so they try to say, no, it's not really mean that, but two provisions before in 1246(i) Congress uses the phrase ""as the case may be"" in a context that unmistakably refers to the Secretary administering the trail. So that means the Secretary of the Interior, and only the Secretary of the Interior can grant the rights-of-way in question here. So -- Mr. Kellogg -- -- the head of the Forest Service -- -- I'm sorry, did you misspeak? You answered Justice Kagan by saying if we believed there was dual administrative powers, that we had to reverse, but I thought you won below? I'm sorry, then you'd have to -- Affirm? I'm sorry, then the Fourth Circuit -- my apologies -- the Fourth Circuit was correct that the Secretary -- that the head of the Forest Service did not have authority to grant this pipeline right-of-way. So you would have to affirm on that basis.
My apologies for -- No, you were confusing me, so I -- I don't know that you have fully satisfied the parade of horribles that have been put forth. In my own judgment, the most serious one is the view that if everything the Park Department administers, the entire trail, that that means that it can stop pipelines or other things across the country, the -- the 200,000 or whatever miles that this is. And I -- I don't know that you have actually articulated concisely a -- a response to why that parade of horribles is not likely. I can -- I can give you -- I don't think it's enough to say that they haven't done it. I can give you a very concrete example.
In the past 50 years, since the Trails Act was passed, there has not been a single new pipeline right-of-way through federal lands under the Appalachian Trail. There have been a number on state, local, and private lands, and the same would apply to other trails.
Now, they acknowledge, for example, that the Blue Ridge Parkway is land in the Park System.
They acknowledge that wild and scenic rivers are land in the Park System. So the same principle that they would block pipelines would apply to them as well. And there is no reason why a parkway constitutes land but a trail does not or why a wild and scenic river would constitute lands and a trail not. Congress even provided ways in which you could move the trail under certain provisions by acquiring new land on which to run the trail.
It did the same thing with the Blue Ridge Parkway. Why would Congress allow pipeline under the Blue Ridge Parkway but not under the trail when those two run parallel to each other and are very close in some spots? That's actually a highly disputed point, whether they have allowed a pipeline under the Appalachian Trail -- under the Blue Ridge Parkway.
460(a)(3), the provision at issue there, is entitled Licensor Permits to Owners of Adjacent Lands. So the one question is, well, is a right-of-way to a pipeline to an owner of an adjacent land, but otherwise it says that it has to be non-consistent with use of such lands for pipeline purposes. So -- For -- for pipeline purposes? For pipe -- for parkway purposes. Parkway purposes. And what you look for in the parkway is the Park Service regulations governing the parkway.
What you look for for the national -- for the Appalachian Trail is the Park Service regulations governing the trail, which specifically cover the kinds of rights-of-ways and pipelines, et cetera, that can pass over -- Well, if -- -- or under the trail. If the statutes allow it to go under the parkway, is there any reason why Congress would say: Well, you can go this far, but you can't go another thousand feet in some spots and go under the trail? Because they wanted to keep the Appalachian Trail, insofar as it's on federal land, where the most beautiful parts of the Appalachian Trail are to be found, through the national forest, through the -- through the Park System, Congress drew a bright line. Well, I mean, that gets to the fundamental question I have about your argument. There may be all sorts of very good environmental reasons why this pipeline shouldn't be built.
And those, I take it, are involved in the other issues in the case, but do you have more than a ""gotcha"" argument? Do you -- I mean, and -- and sometimes they work, but if you fit these statutes together, this is what they say, and you can't get out of it, but do you really have an argument that this is what Congress intended when it adopted the statutes on which you rely? I think we do.
We know, for example, that they had the General Authorities Act before them when they passed the Mineral Leasing Act and created an exception for lands in the Park System from -- from the pipeline authority that they were granting in that Act. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang, two minutes remaining. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you. The statutory regulation of in-holdings was addressed in Sturgeon, Section 10751.
Counsel has not suggested that that broad authority does not apply.
This strikes close to home.
The Potomac Heritage Scenic Trail runs straight through Alexandria. Counsel suggests that such regulation of lands in the National Park System is limited to purposes of the trail.
I would not feel comfortable as a municipal officer given that's the case. And, moreover, that threatens the cooperative management system whereby municipalities have allowed the trail for 50 years, and then going fact -- going back to the 1920s and '30s to cross their lands without necessarily having easements for the trail. Two, land as a property right going down to the earth, that is a very odd fit for this trail that runs across the surface and that can change locations. Three, Congress in Section 1246(a)(1)(A) specifically says the Interior has overall administration of the trail, but then says there's no transfer of management responsibilities for federally-administered lands.
That's the antithesis of the clarity that Congress acts with when it wants to transfer -- Excuse me, Mr. Yang -- -- its exertion of land -- -- that's the problem, which is read that definition. Management and administration have two different meanings.
It says we don't transfer management when -- I get the point.
But the problem is -- That's the problem. -- Petitioner -- the first sentence says: ""Overall administration is administration and management of the trail."" If Petitioner is right that the trail is land, that includes management of the land. But that makes a hash of the second sentence, which says, ""no authority over the land management is transferred."" So Petitioner also -- or Respondent has a problem with Sections 1246(e) and (h)(1), both of which apply only outside the boundaries of federally-administered land, (h)(1) where the trail is outside, and (e) where the right-of-way is outside. There is no such thing under Respondent's theory because the right-of-way and the trail is federally-administered land.
The overall administration -- this is the position of the agencies for 50 years -- that overall administration is spelled out in the Act.
It's a continuous route. You select the right-of-way and then you relocate it.
That's in A(2) and (b).
A uniform marker.
You're a backstop for state and local governments acquiring the required right-of-way. Thank you, counsel. Thank you, Mr. Chief. The case is submitted.
But before counsel leave, I would like to invite Mr. Clement to return to the lectern. Mr. Clement, our records indicate that this was your 100th oral argument before the Court.
That is a rare milestone.
I recognize one of the other members of the exclusive club, Mr. Kneedler, at counsel table. Throughout your career, Mr. Clement, you have consistently advocated positions on behalf of the United States and private clients in an exemplary manner. On behalf of the Court, I extend to you our appreciation for your advocacy before the Court and dedicated service as an officer of this Court. We look forward to hearing from you many more times, beginning, I gather, next week as an amicus -- (Laughter.) -- appointed by this Court.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-67, United States versus Sineneng-Smith. Mr. Feigin. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent acknowledges that in the context of a criminal law, the terms ""encourage"" and ""induce"" can refer solely to acts that facilitate or solicit unlawful activity.
That's the meaning that they have in the context of this criminal law. There's no reason to reach out and give them a vastly more expansive interpretation simply to strike the statute down.
Prohibitions on facilitating or soliciting unlawful activity have existed since before the founding and are perfectly constitutional. Interpreting this law to be unconstitutionally overbroad would deviate from that tradition and directly contradict the canon of constitutional avoidance. Historical understanding and practice confirm that Congress didn't use these familiar criminal law terms to enact a novel and broad ban on speech.
Predecessors to this statute have been on the books since the late 19th Century, and this provision has existed in substantially its current form for decades. Yet, Respondent and her amici have identified no actual instances in which the statute has been applied to protected First Amendment activity or any concrete documented instances of chilling speech. The absence of such evidence isn't just happenstance, and it doesn't just reflect long-standing executive self-restraint.
It's because the statute isn't aimed at speech, and it certainly doesn't encompass substantial amounts of it. To the extent that it could be applied to protected speech, that can be handled through the normal mechanism of as-applied First Amendment challenges in those cases.
This isn't such a case because Respondent's own activity of fraudulently inducing aliens to pay her for a false path to lawful permanent residence isn't protected by the First Amendment, and she is not entitled to the last resort remedy of overbreadth invalidation that the Ninth Circuit on its own initiative reached out to impose. That's particularly so because she was convicted of an offense that required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she acted for the purpose of financial gain.
Yet, she -- You -- you would acknowledge, though, that there are situations in which this would be unconstitutional as applied? Your Honor, I -- I suppose there might be some circumstances where this could be unconstitutional as -- as applied. I don't know that anyone's identified any actual such applications that the statute would reach -- Well, let's suppose -- -- under our reading. -- you know, a grandmother whose granddaughter is in the United States illegally, tells the granddaughter, you know, I hope you will stay because, you know, I will miss you, things will not get better if you go back, so I encourage you to stay.
That -- Well -- -- that -- that would be illegal under the statute, right? -- it would not be illegal under the statute, Your Honor, and here's why: First of all, the issue of when verbal acts or other acts cross the line into criminal complicity or solicitation is not a -- an issue unique to this statute.
It's one that the criminal law has dealt with for centuries. And something that abstract and attenuated is not going to be criminal complicity. In particular, this statute, we think, covers a more narrow subset of criminal complicity and solicitation that really requires substantial participation in some unlawful venture or trying to gin up some unlawful venture with the goal that that unlawful venture actually occur.
And the -- There was -- there was a decision that Circuit Judge Tashima cited -- I think it was a district court in Massachusetts -- in which he said that that was an instance where this statute was applied to encroach on First Amendment rights. So, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think Judge Tashima thought that that particular prosecution, which was not subject to a First Amendment challenge itself, was in violation of the First Amendment.
I think what worried Judge Tashima was a colloquy that occurred during that case in which a discussion was had about a hypothetical case in which, for example, the statute could in theory be applied to the actions of a lawyer. Now, again, the actions of a lawyer and when those cross the line into criminal complicity or solicitation is also not a problem that is unique to this statute, but it is an issue that the criminal law has dealt with for quite a long time. What -- In fact -- -- what about a -- I'm sorry. What about a charity? So a charity provides food to someone who's in the country unlawfully. So, first of all, Your Honor, I think that would be conduct rather than speech, so I don't think it would factor into the overbreadth analysis. Is it covered under this statute? So, if a charity were to give out food to people that the charity knew or recklessly disregarded were in the country unlawfully on the same terms that it gives out food to other needy people, then -- then no, Your Honor. Furthermore, I think, in interpreting the statute, it's important to remember that it's part of the Immigration and Nationality -- What if it's not on the same terms; it's designed to provide food for people who can't get it elsewhere and they know that the people taking advantage of that are here unlawfully? So, Your Honor, there is no explicit exception in the -- in the statute for activities that are denominated as charitable.
So, to the extent that a charity were doing something that violated the plain terms of the statute, that amounted to giving -- effectively giving money to people to -- or something that is the equivalent of money to people with the purpose that those people reside in the United States unlawfully, that might violate the statute. But I think another important limiting feature of the statute is to recall that it is part of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and that statute has to be interpreted as a whole and not to be at war with itself. And in 8 U.S.C. 1621, the Immigration and Nationality Act expressly contemplates that there are going to be circumstances in which public and private benefits may be given to people who are in the United States unlawfully. The statute has never been used, to my knowledge, and Respondent and her amici have not come up with an instance where it's been used, to prosecute conduct of the type that you're hypothesizing, Justice Kavanaugh. Mr. Feigin, but it has been used, according to the Amnesty International brief, and DHS admitted that there was a watch list at the border in which these charitable organizations, people who were giving legal advice at the border, all sorts of individuals were being watched because they potentially violated this encouragement provision and inducement provision. So you're saying there's been no absolute -- there's been no prosecution except Henderson, which was a -- a woman who hired a housekeeper who told her the absolute truth: If you go back, you -- you're not -- if you go -- if you return to your country, you may not get back.
Absolutely true statement, and she was prosecuted for that true statement as an encouragement and inducement for the housekeeper to stay here. But, if you say this has no chilling effect, is that accurate? Well, Your Honor, let me take those two examples in turn. First of all, the Amnesty International letter, if you look at it, the DHS conduct in that case was focused on investigating instances of violence against border patrol agents and suspicions that people were being counseled to lie to immigration officials.
I don't think either of those things is protected by the First Amendment. As to the Henderson case, I think there are more facts and context in that case. That was the prosecution -- and I -- I -- I will acknowledge that that case is very close to the line of what we think the statute could permissibly cover. Could I ask one question? If this lawyer had sincerely believed, because, in fact, it was true or close to the truth, if she just got it wrong, that there was a lawful program that these individuals could have accessed to keep them here, would you have been able to prosecute her? No, Your Honor, we couldn't have.
And I think that goes back to what I was saying to Justice -- May I just interrupt you one second? Sure. You could -- you did prosecute her for fraud, for fraudulently telling her clients that they were eligible for this, correct? Your Honor, to be -- to be clear, the defendant in Henderson was not a lawyer and not someone counseling clients. I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about this case. Oh, we prosecuted -- oh, I'm sorry.
In this particular case? Yes. Yes, we -- we -- she was not acting as a lawyer, although she is a lawyer.
We prosecuted her for lying to her clients, and the jury found that she knew that she was lying to her clients.
She lied to her clients that by applying for a particular government program, she was putting them on a path to lawful permanent residence. She charged each of her clients about $6,000 for that.
She kept sending them letters to tell them that -- So please tell me what the different penalty is for those fraud convictions as opposed to a conviction under this statute. You -- you -- do you mean a conviction under the mail fraud statute, Your Honor? Under the mail fraud statute versus a conviction under this immigration statute.
Is there a difference in the penalties? So the mail fraud statute, I believe, has a statutory range of zero to 20 years of imprisonment, and under this statute, it was zero to 10, I believe, because of the financial gain element. I would emphasize that the fact that this particular conduct may be covered by two different provisions is, first of all, happenstance.
She could have easily given the clients the same advice verbally and then it wouldn't be covered by mail fraud. But let's go back to my original question, which let's say this program was a path, but they were still here unlawfully. Can you read the words of the statute to me that tell me that she wouldn't be prosecuted for encouraging or inducing them to stay while they went for the lawful path? So, Your Honor, we don't think it is encouragement or inducement knowing or in reckless disregard of the alien's unlawful status to either advise them of the existence of or help someone to apply for a lawful government program. And let me explain why.
The -- first of all, an issue like this came up in United States against Williams in which it was -- the argument was put forth to the court that a statute that criminalized ""presenting child pornography"" might in theory be applied to handing child pornography over to the police. And the court was skeptical of such a novel and ""self-defeating interpretation"" of the statute. I think that reflects a broader principle that a statute like this should not lightly be interpreted to apply to conduct that simply participates in a government program. That's particularly true because this statute is part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Isn't -- The Immigration and Nationality Act -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. You said that point, which is a good point.
I want to be sure I get an answer to this question, though, slightly. You've read the briefs, obviously, and they have a long, long list of horribles, of which this is just a few, you know, that you've heard this morning.
But Professor Volokh's brief gets rid of most of these horribles in a simple way.
He lists the conditions under which the Court traditionally has said a solicitation of a crime statute is constitutional, but the first condition and most important is that what you are soliciting is a crime. And it's easy to read this, when they use the word ""law,"" you mean read it violation of criminal law.
Okay? And that would get rid of most of them and -- and I think maybe all of them, I don't know, but I can -- I know that sometimes an alien who enters the United States is committing a crime.
All right? But I can't think of any instance in which residing in the United States is a crime. But, if you could think of one, and you might not like this, but, I mean, I could see saying, well, this is restricted to the prosecution of that one, but, if there's zero, I don't see how we narrow it to -- to solicitation.
Do you follow that? Well, Your Honor, it is a crime to be found in the United States following removal, for example.
So someone who's residing in the United States after having previously been removed who is not entitled to be here would be violating the statute. Okay.
So, suppose, what do you think of that? Are you willing to accept that or not? Well -- What we do is we take Professor Volokh's brief and we say that the statute under constitutional pressure is limited to instances with all the qualifications you've given, there are several there, but the main one is it is -- it is limited to solicitation of a crime. So it is only in the instance that there is a repeat, and the person has to know it and the person who's doing it, a repeat of coming several times or twice to the United States and then, what you just said, and entering several times, you know, and we put that into it, and does that -- does the government accept that? Well, Your Honor, we would certainly -- It would be an alternative in my mind possibly that all the horribles apply and forget the statute part of it. Well, Your Honor, we would certainly prefer that to the alternative of the Ninth Circuit's kind of novel overbreadth invalidation, but I don't think that's -- I don't think that remedy is necessary.
And let me make two points, one about your parade of horribles and then another one about First Amendment law. As to the parade of horribles, I think what's actually ginned up the parade of horribles here is the Ninth Circuit's novel interpretation of the statute.
No one had interpreted it that way before.
And if you look at the amicus briefs, the activities that they are complaining about being chilled are ones in which they openly, publicly, historically, and currently continue to engage. As a matter of First Amendment law, on the other hand, I don't think there's any reason to restrict this to criminal activity.
If you look at the underlying law review article that Professor Volokh cites in his brief, he makes quite clear -- I think this is on the first page of his article -- that this Court's description of the unprotected category of statute -- sorry, the unprotected speech category of speech that is intended to induce and commence illegal activity, which is how Williams describes it, applies to activity that's either civilly or criminally illegal. But what -- what this -- He doesn't say that. He -- he -- he really -- I mean, we couldn't even find one, a case, where -- where of course that makes a huge difference.
We can't find a case where solicitation of X is held to be lawful rather than unconstitutional, where X is not a crime. Well, let -- let me give you a few examples, Your Honor.
So this Court has recently used the example of a business that has out in front of it a White Applicants Only sign, which is facilitating or soliciting the violation of a civil prohibition against racial discrimination in hiring. There are also the cases cited in our briefs, the Gazon case and the Pittsburgh Press case, both of which uphold civil -- Okay.
Okay.
If you take that approach, I see the approach, then all the questions that have been asked become relevant.
And, indeed, it is -- it is the landlady who says to the person, you always have a place here, knowing that that person is illegally in the United States. Or, you know, we can list universities, church groups, I mean, you name it, sanctuary cities, where they're trying to perhaps, whatever they're trying to do, but it wouldn't be tough for -- turn it over to the prosecutors, and they can use it as threats, you turn it -- I mean, all these things that are in the briefs as horribles, okay, your interpretation would introduce them in reality because you've had to make a lot of distinctions, and if I write all these distinctions into an opinion, I won't be certain I haven't left out some. Well, Your Honor, I think there's a reason that we haven't seen that in the many decades, indeed, about 150 years that a statute like this has been on the books. And the reason why they can't document any instances of it and the reason why their amici are all advocacy groups that engage daily in the very activities they claim are chilled. What exactly -- Mister -- -- do you think ""encourage"" means? Are -- are there -- is it your position that speech alone can never constitute a violation of this statute, that there always has to be conduct in addition to the speech? No, Your Honor.
There are, under -- we think ""encourage"" has a meaning that's drawn from traditional criminal complicity law.
""Encourage"" is a very common word that is used in criminal complicity statutes. And what does it mean, specifically what does it mean in this statute? So, in this statute, we think it -- it's not entirely clear whether ""encourage"" is the one that covers solicitation or it's the one that covers complicity.
So I would actually, if I could, prefer to take the two -- Take them together. -- as kind of a package deal. Fine.
What -- what does it mean? We think that it means that you have to substantially participate in the activity as something that the defendant wishes to bring about or to succeed. Well, that's aiding and abetting. It's -- it's different from aiding and abetting in, I think, three distinct ways.
As the current LaFave treatise that's cited in our brief makes clear -- this is on page 457 -- the specific words that a criminal complicity statute uses can have some effect on how it's interpreted, the particular subset of conduct that it covers. And I think here Congress's focus on the words ""encourage"" and ""induce"" mean three things.
First of all, it has to be something that the defendant actually wants to bring about or wants to succeed.
I don't think you can be indifferent about encouraging or inducing. Second, it has to be something that the alien is aware of.
Under normal aiding and abetting law, you could aid and abet -- if it uses the words ""aid and abet,"" you can aid and abet without the principal knowing about it.
If a murderer is about to go shoot somebody and I unload the victim's gun without -- before the murderer gets there and the murderer never knows I did it, I'm still an aider and an abetter. And then the third thing is we think it requires some substantial amount of participation.
And the reason for that is that you can't really encourage -- we've been very consistent about this in the proceedings below too, that you can't really encourage or induce someone in -- in a de minimis way.
It has to be something that really does make the activity more likely to succeed or more likely to occur. So, if the -- if the defendant just says, well, I encourage you to stay here, that might not be enough, but, if the defendant says it 10 times in a forceful voice, that would be a violation? I don't think that kind of more abstract attenuated exhortation is really going to satisfy this particular statute. One additional reason why -- one additional reason why we think some substantial participation is required is because this is coming in clause iv of a five-clause statute. And if you look at clauses i through iii, which cover the other kinds of substantive conduct here, all of them require some sort of substantial participation -- But what do you mean by ""substantial participation""? Because I didn't really take that from your brief, so I'm a little bit confused as to where that's coming from. And, again, what Justice Alito said, I mean, if somebody says I really think you should stay here, here are the 10 reasons why, and repeats that and repeats that, and it's -- it's very definitely encouraging and inducing a person to stay in this country, does that count as substantial participation, or is there some non-speech conduct that has to be added to the mix? Well, Your Honor, I think there are occasions in the criminal law where words can constitute aiding and abetting, and I think that the same is true under this statute. If the Court were to have a problem with that, it could either be addressed through as-applied challenges, as the Chief Justice has mentioned, or, again, we would prefer, to the Ninth Circuit's remedy, something that says that it has to be accompanied -- an interpretation that says that it has to be accompanied by some conduct.
But I don't -- Mr. Feigin -- Yes. -- Mr. Feigin, I -- I -- I just want to give you a shot before your time is up, and -- and I -- I -- I take your point there, such as it is, but two -- two things.
Normally, in the criminal law when we -- in secondary liability, to avoid the First Amendment, we, as Justice Breyer suggested, don't allow punishment for speech greater than the underlying conduct itself.
That would seem to be a basic First Amendment value. So what do we do about the fact that most applications, maybe not all, but most applications here of the underlying conduct would be civilly punished? And here you wish to criminally punish the speech, number one. And, number two, normally we require the aider and abetter or secondary liable person to have a purpose shared with the defendant, the same purpose.
And, here, the government, as I understand it, argued that there's no mens rea required to prove this violation or a very minimal one. Well, Your Honor, below we resisted a mens rea of willfully, which would require some specific -- Yeah, purpose. No, some specific -- having specifically in mind the -- a specific purpose to violate the law. The violation of law, yeah.
Purpose. We do think this requires the same mens rea that this Court described in Rosemond, where the Court said that participation in a crime with knowledge of the attendant circumstances, although this would extend to reckless disregard of the attendant circumstances, would satisfy the normal -- And that's what I guess I'm -- -- criminal complicity -- -- I'm getting at, is that if you -- if recklessness is good enough, so I could be in my speech -- and this gets even beyond the specific versus how -- the conduct and how specific the exhortation has to be, but I could be reckless in my speech in encouraging somebody and -- and wind up a federal criminal even though the underlying violation is merely civil.
Is -- is that the gist of the government's position here? No, Your Honor.
The -- the reckless disregard has to be in relation to the alien's status -- No, I'm recklessly -- -- about the law. -- I'm recklessly indifferent to my granddaughter's status and I'm recklessly encouraging, exhorting her, in whatever level of specificity you require, but I have no intention of -- of violating the -- the immigration laws.
And the underlying conduct that -- for which she can be punished is merely civil. So -- Then what? -- Your Honor, two -- two parts of that.
First of all, reckless -- we don't think there's such a thing as reckless encouragement or inducement.
As I was explaining in my colloquy with Justice Alito, we think the words ""encouragement"" and ""inducement"" in themselves are -- carry a meaning that you have to want the unlawful venture to occur or to succeed.
As to the -- I guess what I'm -- I'm wondering here, Mr. Feigin, at the end of it all and just to cut to the chase is, does the government think that -- that the common law principles of secondary liability that normally try and prevent the dragnet effect of secondary liability from extending too far inform the First Amendment analysis here, or would you just have us blow past all of those guideposts? Well, Your Honor, we do think the statute should be interpreted in conformity with the normal criminal law principles of accomplice liability and solicitation that the Court has long recognized apply to these as a matter -- But the problem is -- and this is -- Do you agree with Professor Volokh or do you not? Your Honor, I do not agree, or we do not agree, with Professor Volokh's suggestion in his brief that this needs to be limited to criminal activity.
Again, if you -- if you look at the article that he cites in his brief, it has some of the same examples that I was just using -- Mr. Feigin -- -- with the Court of -- I don't know where -- I don't know where Professor Volokh got this idea, but there are situations in which a person -- in which the -- the commission of the -- of the offense that is encouraged is not made criminal because of the vulnerable position of the person who is engaging in that act, but it doesn't necessarily follow that encouraging that person to do the thing cannot be made criminal. I think that's exactly right.
If I could just quickly answer and then reserve the balance -- Very briefly. Yeah.
I -- for example, you could decide to make prostitution a civil offense and still criminally punish recruiting prostitutes. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fleming. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd begin with two points.
First, Congress means what it says.
This provision doesn't mention solicitation.
It doesn't mention aiding and abetting.
Congress knows how to use those words when it wants to.
The words it did use are much broader.
""Encourage"" or ""induce,"" used together, cover every form of influence and persuasion, as this Court said in the Electrical Workers case. In this statute, falsity is not an element, nor is truth a defense.
Even accurate advice encouraging someone to stay is banned. And as a result, this law makes a felon of a teacher who says to an undocumented student that she should stay and pursue her education, it makes a felon of a pastor who says to undocumented worshippers that they can stay and freely exercise their religion, it makes a felon of a doctor who encourages an undocumented patient to stay here for medical treatment, and as the government has still never denied, it makes a felon of a lawyer who advises an undocumented client that her best route to lawful status is to remain physically present in the United States.
So, if the statute is read as written, which we think it should be, it is substantially overbroad. The second point, however -- and I think this was pointed up effectively in Justice Gorsuch's question -- is that even were this Court to rewrite this law as a solicitation provision -- and we don't think it can -- it would still be overbroad.
And that is because there is no historical tradition, going back to 1791 or since, supporting a categorical exclusion from the First Amendment for solicitation of non-criminal conduct. All of the government's common law examples, going back to Sir Edward Coke and Sir Matthew Hale, all involve solicitation of crime, per Justice Breyer's question.
Professor Volokh explains this, and he explains why that's the case, because solicitation offenses fall within the traditional exception of speech integral to a crime. There is no dispute, however, that nothing my client did encouraged or even solicited anyone to commit a crime.
So, Justice Breyer, were the Court to read the statute in the way that Your Honor suggested -- although I don't think that's a fair reading of what Congress did -- but, if the Court were to rewrite it that way, the judgment of acquittal would still have to be affirmed because there is no suggestion that any of my client's -- the people that she encouraged were ever encouraged to commit a crime or did commit a crime. Well, on -- on this point -- Mr. Feigin, was there anything in this statute -- this is little iv, and the earlier parts of the statute, i, ii, and iii.
Is there anything that she could have been convicted of when she was taking people's money and doing nothing for them? So, to answer the question, Justice Ginsburg, and then I'll address the premise.
But, to answer the question, no.
Provisions i, ii, and iii of 1324(a)(1) -- (a)(1)(A) do not prohibit my client's conduct. However, the falsity aspect built into your question was the basis of the government's mail fraud prosecution.
And one thing I'd like to correct in what Mr. Feigin said is a mail fraud prosecution doesn't require that a mailing be fraudulent.
It just requires a fraudulent scheme where there is a use of the mail that is incident to the scheme. And that's how this case was charged. She wasn't accused of putting something in the mail that was fraudulent.
The misrepresentations that were accused were oral misrepresentations. So whether the fraud is supposedly written or oral, as long as there is a mailing, which, in connection with immigration, there will almost always be because applications are filed with the government, either by mail or there will be a use of the wires if someone uses a telephone or the Internet, any actual fraudulent scheme can be readily prosecuted and is readily prosecuted by the Federal Government. There was one count -- there were five counts.
Two were knocked out by the Ninth Circuit judgment.
So the two -- the three remaining counts, two were mail fraud. What was the other one? There were -- so there were three people who were -- three non-citizens who were offered as potential victims.
One did not testify at trial.
And so, as to that one person, both the mail fraud and the immigration encouragement count were thrown out.
She was convicted of two counts of mail fraud and two counts of encouragement for the other two. There are also two tax-related counts to which she pled. On Professor Volokh's point, it's an interesting point.
I want to give you this example and get your reaction to it. There's a teenager who's -- who has been very seriously bullied and is very depressed and is thinking of committing suicide. The teenager has a gun in his hand.
He calls up the one person he thinks is his friend and he says, I'm thinking of killing myself.
And the person on the other end of the line says, you've said this before, I'm tired of hearing this from you, you never follow through, you're a coward, why don't you just do it, I encourage you to pull the trigger. Now is that protected by the First Amendment? Is that speech protected by the First Amendment? Attempting to commit suicide is not a crime. So I -- I don't think that it would be protected, Justice Alito. Why? I think that -- What is -- why -- why would that be? So doesn't that defeat the argument that you can never -- someone can never be convicted of speech that encourages an activity that is not criminal? No, I think -- I think incitement to suicide would fall within the Brandenburg exception.
You're talking about inciting imminent harm and imminent lawlessness. Also, let's remember, at Common Law, suicide was a crime.
And so the framers may well have considered that speech soliciting or aiding and abetting suicide was, in fact, not something that was being protected -- Well, it's not -- -- by the First Amendment. -- it's not a crime today. No, not today. And why would this -- why does this not qualify under Brandenburg? Why does it not qualify? Why would encouraging someone to remain in the country illegally not qualify under Brandenburg? I -- first of all, I don't think that's an argument the government is making, and I think for good reason. Brandenburg generally applies -- only allows regulation of incitement to immediate lawless activity and arguably violent lawless activity -- Well, okay, if it's limited to -- -- which in this instance is not going to cause harm. -- if it's limited to violent activity, that would be -- that would be a limitation.
But, certainly, the unlawfulness here is imminent.
In fact, the unlawfulness exists prior to the speech and exists a nanosecond after the speech ended, so it is imminent. I -- and I think that's a -- that's another distinction from the suicide case that I was going to get to, is most state laws that prohibit the solicitation of suicide have a causation requirement.
So there has to actually be some connection between the speech and what's going to happen. Here, if you have someone who's already here, this statute has no causation requirement.
It also has no mens rea requirement.
I was astonished that Mr. Feigin stood up and said that they're willing to import one now, that there have to be some requirement that the defendant share the goal of this actually happening -- Isn't it -- -- because that's not how this jury was instructed. -- isn't it odd to think of somebody encouraging somebody to do something if the person who's doing the encouraging does not intend for the person to do that thing? Isn't that built into the concept of encouragement? If it were, Justice Alito, then the jury should have been accordingly instructed.
But the government consistently rejected any kind of mens rea instruction in this case, other than the one expressly called out in the statute, which is that the defendant know or recklessly disregard the immigration status of the individual. Well -- But on page 50 -- -- and that might be a reason for reversing the conviction for improper instructions to the jury, but I don't know that it's a ground for holding that the statute is unconstitutional. Well, I -- I would say at the very least, if the Court were to rewrite the statute either in the way the government put forward in its brief or in the way that Mr. Feigin is now suggesting for the first time now, there would at the very least need to be a remand for a new trial under the new statute asserted by the government. Before you leave this, I don't know if this can be done, honestly don't, but, I mean, in thinking of the -- of the Volokh brief and the rewriting, you -- you -- all you -- one thing you do is it says violation of law.
You would say violation of criminal law.
All right? You'd to have do that. You would. And you imply criminal law in order to avoid the constitutional thing.
Then you have the other -- the other restrictions, such as Mr. Feigin gave and such as Volokh gives and so forth, and say the reason we rewrite it this way, because it may be that sometimes Justice Alito's examples are all right, it may well be, I don't know all -- all the possibilities there, but the reason we write it this way is we assume that what Congress would have preferred to the unconstitutionality of the statute is the common definition, the common definition and use of the word ""solicitation."" See, in other words, we take the heart of solicitation, read that into Congress's mind, and put in the word ""criminal."" Now how far -- I mean, you might not have thought of this and I don't know, but I am curious to know what your reaction to it is. So my reaction, Justice Breyer, is, first of all, if Your Honor were to do that, my client gets acquitted.
Judgment affirmed.
I want to be very clear about that. As a matter of statutory interpretation, I'm not sure that that's -- I think that's a bridge too far.
It would be permissible if Congress had written solicit, but it didn't.
It wrote encourage or induce. And Congress knows how to say solicit when it wants to.
It says it in 18 U.S.C. 373, and, as this Court said in Clark versus Martinez, constitutional avoidance only kicks in after all the ordinary textual analysis of the statute as a whole has been exhausted. And in this circumstance, I think every textual indicator whatsoever shows that Congress meant to do what it said, which was to ban encouragement, which is speech.
It isn't a narrow solicitation provision.
It isn't an aiding and abetting provision. We know that not just because that's what the words say but because Congress wrote an aiding and abetting provision just two subparagraphs later using those words specifically. We know that the aiding and abetting provision, that one two subparagraphs down, applies to subsection (4), which would mean, if rewritten to mean solicitation, you could be convicted of aiding and abetting solicitation or aiding and abetting aiding and abetting, which is at the very least counterintuitive, if not absurd. And we also know that if you limit it to a conduct-based provision, it is now completely redundant of the three provisions that come immediately before. The government has not pointed to any actual conduct that it would be able to prosecute under a narrowed encouragement provision that it can't already prosecute under other provisions.
Similarly, it has not explained what work this encouragement provision would do if narrowed that way because every example it has of actual wrongdoing that it would want to be able to punish, it can punish under Sections 1 through 3 or under the document fraud statute, Section 1546, or as in this case under mail fraud. Counsel -- If the statute, just to be clear, if the statute said aid, abet or solicit, that would be constitutional? It would not, Justice Kavanaugh, because of the civil/criminal issue we've been discussing.
It would say aid, abet or solicit conduct that in itself is not criminal.
Let's make no mistake about what the government -- If we didn't -- if we didn't agree with you on that point, would -- and it said aid, abet or solicit, would it then be constitutional? I -- I still don't think it would be because -- Why not? Well, because you are talking about a statute that singles out one particular category of civil violations for -- for criminal solicitation liability.
Why this one in particular and not any other civil violations, many of which could be -- are -- are subject to solicitation or encouragement without any criminal consequence.
Many actual federal crimes, there's no general federal solicitation statute.
There's only 373, which deals with crimes of violence. Mr. Fleming -- Counsel -- sorry. -- I -- I -- I go back to an example that was given earlier by Justice Breyer, but there is a statute which has to do with employers hiring illegal aliens.
And there is no statute that makes it illegal for the employee to -- for an alien to be employed. So what do you do with that example? There's a statute that makes it illegal not to use the federal, whatever, system, verification system, but there's no actual law that makes it illegal for an alien to work in the United States. So the -- They can't -- you know, they have to provide a Social Security card and all of this other stuff, and those acts are going to make them criminally liable, but certainly not the act of being employed. I -- I think those fall under the -- the also recognized prohibition on offers to engage in transactions that are themselves banned.
Right? I mean, hiring someone is not protected speech.
So Congress can obviously ban hiring someone who is not lawfully authorized to be in this country. Is that your answer to the prostitution case? Why the -- I mean, in -- in some ways, yes, I mean, I think -- because you can decriminalize prostitution, but you can still criminalize paying someone to engage in -- in -- in sex.
That's not speech; that's -- There are -- -- conduct. -- there are a lot of examples of instances where states have made things illegal -- make it -- makes it illegal to encourage somebody to do something that is not itself illegal involving minors, encouraging a minor to purchase alcohol -- to -- to -- to purchase alcohol or to consume alcohol, or encourage a person of diminished capacity to engage in some kind of dangerous activity. I mean, you're going to do a lot of damage if you accept this distinction that you can never criminalize encouraging a vulnerable person to do something that is not itself illegal on the part of the -- criminal on the part of the person who's encouraged. So I don't know of any statute that sweeps as broadly as this one.
The -- the -- the liquor laws that the government cites actually are not framed in terms of aiding and abetting the minor's conduct.
There's a separate prohibition on furnishing alcohol to a minor.
That is an act.
That is conduct.
That is not speech.
Of course, a state can make that illegal. It can also make illegal aiding and abetting the furnishing of the conduct -- of the alcohol.
So a 23-year-old buys alcohol for a minor, the liquor store attendant who sells the alcohol knowing that it's going to the minor is aiding and abetting that conduct.
But no one -- no statute that I know of is framed in terms of aiding and abetting the non-criminal conduct of the minor. Well, let me ask you -- But you have to -- -- one more -- one more question that -- about something that seems unusual about your overbreadth argument. Usually, in a free speech overbreadth case, the defendant has engaged in speech, and the defendant says even if my speech is not protected, I can assert free speech claims of other people. But, here, your client was not prosecuted for engaging in speech.
She was prosecuted for encouragement through conduct. And so you have somebody who didn't engage in speech at all making free speech case -- free speech claims that could be asserted by other people. Now free speech -- overbreadth is a -- is a strong doctrine, but are there other -- are there other cases where this has happened? And if not, why should we extend it into this new area? I think the best example is Coates versus Cincinnati.
That -- that was an -- an overbreadth challenge.
That was the one where the -- where the ordinance prohibited being on the streets of Cincinnati engaging in -- in -- in annoying conduct.
And it was not clear what Mr. Coates had actually done.
The record before the court didn't even show what it was. And this Court recognized that the ordinance could have prohibited all manner of prohibitable conduct, like blocking traffic or littering the streets, but it nonetheless found the ordinance to be unconstitutionally overbroad because it was directed to a substantial amount of protected speech. And this is the same case.
We do not need to show that the conduct that Ms. Sineneng-Smith engaged in was protected speech if the statute, as it plainly does, sweeps within its ambit a substantial amount of -- of protected speech when compared to the -- the legitimate sweep of the statute. Mr. Fleming, what do we -- Can -- can -- -- what do we do about the fact that there haven't been prosecutions brought of the kind that you talk about? I mean, there's obviously no requirement that that be the case, but there is a view that there has to be a realistic risk of a statute that's overbroad being applied to protected activity. So where does the realistic risk come from in the absence of actual prosecutions that you can point to and say, ah, that went wrong? I'd like to point to the Henderson case and I'd like to clarify a statement that -- that Mr. Feigin made about it. One of -- this is the case in Boston, where Ms. Henderson was prosecuted, and one of the theories, an independent theory of liability, was that she gave advice to her undocumented housekeeper: If you stay here, they won't let you back.
And the district court's opinion on page 200 makes very clear that is an alternative theory of criminal liability.
It's not just hiring the person; it was also the advice that was given.
And that's why the district judge engaged in the colloquy with the hypothetical about the lawyer, is because it was a prosecution of advice. Okay, I'll take the point, but broaden it out a little bit in terms of your answers.
You just said, okay, there's not zero; there's one. There's at least one that we -- we know of. Okay. Yes, that's right.
And in -- and in terms of the others, I mean, I think Your Honor said this, but I'll -- I'll reinforce it to the extent I might, which is I don't think this Court has ever required a certain number of actual prosecutions.
The overbreadth doctrine there is -- the overbreadth doctrine is triggered by the substantial sweep of the statute carrying within its ambit a ban on protected speech.
The fact that the government is careful enough usually not to charge it in those cases does not take away the fact that it risks chilling the speech substantially. Now Mr. Feigin makes the point in his brief and again this morning that, well, lots of people are actually making this speech already within the ban.
That's not relevant either. When this Court decided the Stevens case, it pointed to hundreds of hunting websites and hunting magazines that contained depictions of animal cruelty that fell within the ban. That was not a weakness of the challenge.
That was a strength of the challenge because it showed that the speech was not fanciful or hypothetical but actually was happening. I point out this statute historically was not used very much, but the -- the government has recently made it a focus of enforcement.
The religious organizations' amicus makes this point on page 30.
And it's also something that, as Justice Sotomayor's question pointed up, they are using as the basis for investigation of U.S. citizens for their prayer, for their speech, and for their legal advice. And so, even though in the past there may not have been that many uses of this statute, one can expect that if this Court upholds the statute, it will continue to be threatened and used.
And whether it's ultimately used does not matter because the First Amendment does not require us to rely on the grace of the executive branch. What do you -- It protects us from these situations. Go back for one second, because I -- I'm taking in your answer to what I asked before.
But imagine this: One, says the opinion, this -- the -- the government wants this to be interpreted as a solicitation statute.
So be it.
We insert the word. Now, two, solicitation has some rules around it.
One is what Justice Gorsuch said. You don't punish as a criminal that which isn't. But there might be exceptions to that.
General rule, general rule, with possible exceptions. Two, it has to be imminent.
That's Brandenburg. Three, it has to be very specific.
And there could be some others. Now it does require us to add one sentence. Right. We interpret it as Congress picking up, in the government's view, solicitation, the common definition of solicitation, not including the exceptions, et cetera, because this is a common kind of thing, you see, something like that. That's it.
That's the question, because that's what's floating around in my mind. I think, Your Honor, if you write that opinion, you'd have to add one more sentence -- Yeah. -- which is the judgment below is affirmed.
But, if you add that sentence, we would be fine with it -- (Laughter.) -- with one exception or one question, which is the notion that there might be exceptions to the rule that solicitation has to be limited to a solicitation of criminal conduct with specific intent on the part of the defendant that the criminal conduct be committed.
If that -- Would we -- would we -- I'm sorry. Would we have to get that passed by the Senate and House -- (Laughter.) -- and then signed by the President before we could put that -- that many changes to the statute? Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.
And the fact that you would need to do that in order for it to be constitutional is a good indication that Congress did not mean for the statute to be read that way, which is why we think the easier opinion to write is an opinion that says we look at the text, we look at the context, and there's nothing in this subsection (iv) that suggests that Congress meant the kind of limited statute that Justice Breyer is proposing. Would you talk a little bit about that generally? Because, you know, we obviously like to save statutes rather than to kill statutes.
So what can we do, consistent with our own role and consistent with our understanding that Congress's role is different? But when is it possible for us to narrow statutes without being subject to the critique that where we're rewriting them? And is it possible in this case? I -- I don't think it's possible in this case because all of the textual indicators point in terms -- in the direction of the interpretation that I've been advocating and that the court below took. I think, as a general matter, this Court interprets statutes; it doesn't rewrite them.
And if there is an interpretation of the statute as a whole -- I don't just mean a single word -- I mean, certainly ""encourage"" can mean lots of different things, but it is very broad and capacious.
And unless there is a suggestion that Congress meant to adopt a narrower interpretation -- here, there is no textual indication of that -- I don't think that's permissible.
I was -- But then we would never -- then we would never do a narrowing construction because you would always say, well, just go with what the words of the statute mean. No.
I think there are -- there are times -- When can you do -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's point, when can you do a narrowing construction? You have a broad term, if read literally would be broad. When can you narrow? I think, as this Court said in Clark versus Martinez, what the Court does is it applies all the standard rules of textual analysis of statutes, not just interpreting a particular word but looking at how it's used in context, looking at the common law background against which Congress legislates, looking at the overall structure of the statute, looking at legislative history sometimes. When all of that has been exhausted, if the Court still thinks that the statute is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to two different meanings, then constitutional avoidance has some force, and you pick the one that is going to avoid the constitutional avoidance. Well, when you do all that, you usually have a best interpretation so you don't get to the constitutional avoidance.
That's the -- that's the problem. Often, I -- I think the problem is can you read the statute to be not the best interpretation but a -- but a second best so as to save the statute, as Justice Kagan says, and -- and not opine too forcefully on the First Amendment limits when you don't have to, to avoid some of Justice Alito's hypotheticals? Often, one can do that. This is not a case in which I think you can, but I'm -- I'm not here to suggest that constitutional avoidance never works.
It does. But the first thing one has to do -- and the Court has been clear about this -- is read the statute and apply the standard tools. And I think, when you do this here, there isn't -- there isn't much objection to this on the other side, that -- that when you -- when you read the words, when you look at the fact that Congress uses aiding and abetting and soliciting in other provisions, when it means to reference those doctrines, when you look at the fact that the -- the -- the statute under the government's reading would be completely duplicative and redundant of everything else that comes before and swallow it all up, like the Court said in Yates, that is not a plausible reading.
And the government has given no persuasive account of what work this provision would be doing if read their way. When you're left with that, you're saying what are we doing if we turn this encouraging and inducing statute into a solicitation statute, other than rewriting and putting in a statute that Congress could have passed if it wished. I'll point out the second problem with constitutional avoidance is the discussion that we've been having this morning, which is it doesn't actually avoid the problem because, if all you're doing is change the verb from encourage and induce to solicit, you are simply creating a brand-new First Amendment exclusion by creating a statute that prohibits encouraging or soliciting non-criminal conduct, which we've never seen a single statute like that before -- Mister -- -- as the point that -- Go ahead. Well, Mr. Fleming, could I take you back to the question I asked before, when you gave me the answer that Coates is a case that falls within the category that I mentioned, and you said we didn't know what Coates was doing, but, actually, the opinion says Coates was a student involved in a demonstration and the other appellants were pickets involved in a labor dispute. That is expressive conduct at the very least.
So I -- I ask you again, do you have a case in which a person who did not engage in speech is able to make a free speech overbreadth argument? I -- I -- I mean, Coates may have been involved, but I'm not sure what the Court knew in that event.
I think there's a footnote in the opinion that says it's not clear exactly what he was doing.
He was part of the group.
So I think that's the best example. That said, the -- one of the cornerstones of the overbreadth doctrine is that as long as you are charged under the provision, which my client clearly was, and she herself, by the way -- the indicted conduct was the sending of a retainer in which she agreed to file non-fraudulent applications with the government. There's no suggestion that anything she did was actually fraudulent in terms of what she was indicted for for these counts.
The mail fraud counts had to do with oral statements made earlier. So there was, in fact, an as-applied free speech argument made.
It wasn't decided by the Ninth Circuit.
It's not covered by the question presented.
But she did engage in speech.
That's our position. But it doesn't matter for purposes of the question before the Court because this is an overbreadth challenge against the sweep of this statute far beyond any legitimate conduct that the government would need to prohibit because there are many other statutes that prohibit actual conduct-based wrongdoing. Unless -- if I may, I'd just like to point out this is a very unusual statute. If Congress wrote a statute that said it is a crime to aid, abet, or solicit certain serious civil offenses, A, B, C, is that law on its face permissible? I would say not without some proof, because, if we take Stevens seriously, as I think we have to, there would have to be some kind of evidence that the framers, at the time that they wrote the First Amendment, expected that category of speech to be excluded from its ambit. If Congress had rewrote it to say it is a crime to aid or abet or solicit certain offenses and then lists -- and makes them crimes, you're okay with that, obviously? I mean, that raises -- that's a harder case.
Thankfully, we don't have to deal with that here.
That raises, I think, the difficult question, which Mr. Feigin I think very wisely stayed away from, which is it's hard to tell sometimes the line between protected speech and unprotected solicitation. Remember, in Williams, this Court said it's perfectly okay to say to someone, I -- I encourage you to obtain child pornography. That's protected.
So is it enough? I mean, solicitation of violent offenses, we know that that -- that can be prohibited.
Solicitation of minor offenses, I think that's a difficult question.
This Court doesn't have a lot of solicitation cases on the books.
Maybe one day Your Honors will have to decide it, but that is not today. So I would just like to be very clear. This is a statute that uses very broad words. It uses them in the context in which all they can do is ban free speech.
The result is that vast amounts of truthful and accurate and heartfelt speech that's in no way related and much less integral to any actual crime is subject to five years in federal prison. I would submit that the First Amendment is wisely designed to protect us from just this kind of a law, and we would respectfully request that the judgment be affirmed. Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Feigin. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I take Respondent's principal submission today to be that you simply can't read these words to mean anything other than the incredibly broad reading that Respondent in the Ninth Circuit attribute to them and that's why you can't do constitutional avoidance, but that's simply not true. As Respondent acknowledges on pages 20 to 21 of her brief, these words can, in the context of a criminal complicity provision, at least under the canon of noscitur sociis, have the meaning that we are attributing to them today.
And if they can have that meaning in that context, they can have that meaning in this context. These are not unusual or strange words to use in this context to mean what we are saying that they mean.
As we point out in our brief, they are commonly used in state statutes, the Model Penal Code, the LaFave treatise, even decisions of this Court have used them in that way. Used in that way, they fill a gap in this statute that includes conduct, for example, under clause 1, the alien -- someone needs to actually bring the alien into the United States, so even aiding and abetting, bringing into the United States, wouldn't cover certain kinds of help for aliens who come into the United States by themselves. Congress was using these words in their normal criminal law meaning because let's not forget, this statute, as I was discussing earlier with Justice Breyer, covers the facilitation, solicitation of a lot of actual criminal conduct, coming to and entering the United States unlawfully. To the extent that it also covers certain civil violations, for reasons I've discussed, I think this Court has recognized in previous cases like Pittsburgh Press and Gazzam and in the white-applicants-only example that Congress or another legislature can civilly proscribe speech that facilitates activities that are civilly prohibited. And if Congress -- and if that were really protected speech, Congress or another legislature couldn't even civilly proscribe it. The reason why it can be civilly proscribed is because it is unprotected speech. And if it's unprotected speech, then it can be subject to a criminal prohibition as well. This -- to the extent that this statute may reach some protected speech, it can be handled as applied.
There is no reason to read this statute as broadly as Respondent is contending that it needs to be read here and that the Ninth Circuit read it for the very first time -- Mr. Feigin -- -- in this case. -- what in reading this statute would give an average person notice of all of the limitations you're suggesting to us? Because I read ""encourage or induce an alien to come, enter, or reside in the U.S., knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law,"" seems to me that all of the examples that were raised earlier, the hospital that's treating a child with -- an illegally present child with a disease, the church who provides worship to illegal aliens, all of the other examples that were given on their face to the common reader of those words would be a violation of the statute. Well, Your Honor, I don't think that is the standard -- I don't think that's the standard this Court applies that someone is ignorant of what those words mean in the context of the criminal law. Again, these are not -- these are not words that are unique to this statute.
If you look at the LaFave treatise, Section 13.2, the word ""encouraging"" is used as the title of section headings to describe accomplice liability.
This Court used the word -- But accomplice liability -- -- ""induce"" in Williams. -- has all sorts of meaning that you're not endorsing.
You're saying this is not aiding and abetting.
You're saying it's not solicitation.
It's something else -- No, Your Honor -- -- altogether? -- we are using the principles of complicity and solicitation in a statute that is directed at large amounts of criminal activity to inform what these words mean here. I -- I suppose it is possible that someone who does not have any knowledge of how those words are used in the context of facilitation or solicitation statutes might look at it and might have the reaction that they should be given a different meaning, but I don't think that's the standard this Court should apply.
Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.",1.0
